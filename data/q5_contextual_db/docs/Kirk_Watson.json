{"page_content": "Kirk Preston Watson (born March 18, 1958) is an American attorney and politician who has served as the 59th mayor of Austin since 2023, previously holding the office as the 54th mayor from 1997 to 2001. A member of the Democratic Party, he ran unsuccessfully for Texas attorney general in the 2002 election, where he was defeated by Republican Greg Abbott, later governor of Texas. In 2006, Watson was elected to the Texas Senate from District 14.\nIn 2011, Watson was chosen by his Democratic colleagues to chair the Senate Democratic Caucus and served until 2015. On the first day of the 86th Texas Legislature, he was chosen by his colleagues\u2014Democrats and Republicans\u2014to serve as president pro tempore. The position typically goes to the most senior member, regardless of party, who has not yet served as president pro tem, and is second in line of succession to the Governor.\nIt was announced by the Austin American-Statesman that Watson had planned to resign from the Texas Senate to become the first dean of the University of Houston's Hobby School of Public Affairs. His resignation was effective April 30, 2020. With incumbent Mayor Steve Adler not seeking another term, Watson entered the race to become Austin mayor for a second time. He was elected for his second stint as mayor in the 2022 Austin mayoral election runoff with 50.4% of the vote.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWatson was born in Oklahoma City and raised in Saginaw, Texas, a suburb of Fort Worth, where he attended Boswell High School. He received a bachelor's degree in political science in 1980 and a Juris Doctor in 1981 from Baylor University in Waco, Texas. At Baylor Law School, Watson was editor-in-chief of the Baylor Law Review and graduated first in his class. He subsequently clerked for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n\n\n== Early political career ==\nWatson was elected president of the Texas Young Lawyers Association in 1990 and served on the executive committee of the State Bar of Texas. Watson was an active Democrat throughout the 1990s and served as the chairman of the Travis County Democratic Party.\nIn 1991, Watson was appointed by Governor Ann Richards to serve as chairman of the Texas Air Control Board, the state agency that was charged with protecting air quality in Texas.  During his tenure, he worked to merge the agency with the Texas Air Control Board and the Texas Water Commission to form the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission, and oversaw implementation of the 1991 amendments to the federal Clean Air Act.\nIn 1994, he was named the Outstanding Young Lawyer of Texas. In 1997, Watson co-founded the Austin law firm of Watson Bishop London & Galow, creating a broad law practice that represented families, doctors, small businesses, and some of the state's major universities.\n\n\n== First term as Mayor of Austin (1997\u20132001) ==\nIn 1997, after Watson moved from Rollingwood to Austin, he was elected as the 54th mayor of Austin, a nonpartisan position. He ran on a pledge to build consensus in a city that was then dominated by political battles between environmentalists and developers. He campaigned to raise more than $78 million for land preservation and $300 million for transportation improvements. Watson's signature accomplishments as mayor included the transformation of Downtown Austin into a \"24-hour downtown\" by encouraging development of housing and retail in place of vacant warehouses and parking lots, partially through tax incentives and the city's Smart Growth initiatives.\nIn 1999, Watson spearheaded a redevelopment project along several blocks of waterfront property in Downtown Austin, in an effort to create a new public-private \"digital district\" in place of dilapidated warehouses and businesses including the former Liberty Lunch, which were demolished. Watson, along with architect Larry Speck, courted the Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) by offering a $10.4 million tax incentive to anchor two office buildings on the site in\nThe 2024 Austin mayoral election will be held on November 5, 2024, to elect the next mayor of Austin, Texas. The election is nonpartisan; candidates' party affiliations will not appear on the ballot. Incumbent mayor Kirk Watson is running for re-election, after returning to the position of mayor following the 2022 election. \nDue to the passage of Prop D in 2021, this is the first Austin mayoral election to coincide with a presidential election.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\n\n\n=== Declared ===\nJeffery Bowen, member of the Austin Board of Adjustment\nDoug Greco, nonprofit executive and author of To Find a Killer (party affiliation: Democratic)\nCarmen Llanes Pulido, former Austin Planning Commission member (party affiliation: Democratic)\nKathie Tovo, former city councilor from the 9th district (2011\u20132023) (party affiliation: Democratic)\nKirk Watson, incumbent mayor (party affiliation: Democratic)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial campaign websites for mayoral candidates\nJeff Bowen for Mayor\nDave Greco (D) for Mayor\nCarmen Llanes Pulido (D) for Mayor\nKathie Tovo (D) for Mayor\nKirk Watson (D) for Mayor\nBallotpedia - Mayoral election in Austin, Texas (2024)\nThe mayor of Austin is the official head of the city of Austin in the U.S. state of Texas. The office was established in 1840 after Austin incorporated as a city in 1839. The mayor of Austin is elected to a four-year term and limited to serving no more than two terms.\nKirk Watson took office as mayor on January 6, 2023, for a second term, having served as mayor from 1997 to 2001.\n\n\n== Duties and powers ==\nAustin has a council\u2013manager form of government which means day-to-day operations of the city are run by the city manager. The mayor is the head of city government ceremonially. The mayor is technically a member of the city council and is required to preside at all meetings. The mayor is also allowed to vote on all matters that come before the city council, but has no veto powers.\nAs of fiscal year 2022\u20132023, the salary for the mayor is set at $134,191.\n\n\n== Election ==\nThe mayor is elected in a citywide election. Currently, elections occur every four years during even-numbered years. Elections are non-partisan and by majority, but if no candidate receives a majority a run-off election is called between the top two candidates who received the most votes.\n\n\n== Succession ==\nPer city code of ordinances, if the mayor is absent or disabled, the Mayor Pro Tem is to act as mayor until the mayor returns or an election is held to fill the vacancy.\nThe mayor is subject to recall by registered voters if a petition is signed and filed that contains the signatures of 10 percent of the qualified voters. If the petition is verified, a recall election is called at the earliest convenient available date. If the recall passes, the mayor immediately vacates office. There are two limitations to the recall process. First, no recall petition can be filed until the mayor has been in office for at least six months. Second, the mayor will not be subject to more than one recall.\n\n\n== List of mayors of Austin ==\n\n\n== References ==\nThe 2024 United States elections were held on Tuesday, November 5, 2024. In the presidential election, former president Donald Trump was elected again and JD Vance was elected to be vice president. In addition, all 435 seats in the United States House of Representatives and 34 of the 100 seats in the United States Senate were contested to determine the membership of the 119th United States Congress. Thirteen state and territorial governorships and numerous other state and local elections were also contested. The following presidential election will be the 2028 presidential election.\n\n\n== Issues ==\n\n\n=== Economic issues ===\n\nVoters consistently cited the economy as their top issue in the 2024 election. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, a global surge in inflation ensued that raised prices on many goods, though the U.S. inflation rate had declined significantly during 2023 and 2024. The New York Times reported that both candidates \"embraced a vision of a powerful federal government, using its muscle to intervene in markets in pursuit of a stronger and more prosperous economy.\"\n\n\n=== Election interference ===\n\nDomestic Pro-Israel groups have spent large sums of money to support pro-Israel candidates against candidates critical of the Israeli government. According to a campaign finance analysis by Politico, AIPAC is the \"biggest source of Republican money flowing into competitive Democratic primaries this year.\"\nSeveral foreign nations may have interfered in the 2024 United States elections, the most notable being China, Iran, and Russia. The efforts have largely focused on propaganda and disinformation campaigns using inauthentic accounts on social media, and stoking domestic divisions and denigrating the United States and democracy more broadly.\n\n\n=== Abortion ===\nThis was the first presidential election held after the overturn of Roe v. Wade, and the third overall election cycle after the 2022 midterm elections and the 2023 off-year elections. Republican-controlled states predominantly passed near-total bans on abortion in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's June 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision. By April 2023, abortion was \"largely illegal\" in several states. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, there were 15 states that had de jure early stage bans on abortion explicitly without exceptions for rape or incest: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. (Ohio voters subsequently codified abortion rights in Ohio's state constitution via November 2023 Ohio Issue 1.) In states with laws granting exceptions, it was reported de facto that \"very few exceptions to these new abortion bans have been granted\" and that patients who had been raped or otherwise qualified for exceptions were being turned away, citing \"ambiguous laws and the threat of criminal penalties make them unwilling to test the rules\".\nDemocrats outperformed Biden's results in the 2020 U.S. presidential election in several 2022 House special elections, with abortion cited as a major contributor to their victories. Then during the 2023 elections, both Democratic and Republican operatives attributed the Democrats' overperformance streak to the growing bipartisan support of broad abortion rights in the wake of Dobbs decision. Thus, many conservative political analysts and commentators called a continued Republican alliance with the anti-abortion movement \"untenable\" and an \"electoral disaster\", and urged the party to favor abortion rights. Some issue polling has shown Donald Trump, the 2024 Presidential Republican nominee, outrunning his party and closing the gap with Democrats on the issue of abortion, but no election data with Trump directly on the ballot has happened to verify these results.\nMark Robinson, who once advocated for a complete abortion ban without exceptions, underwent a rhetorical shift in his North Carolina g\nSouth of Sanity is a 2012 British horror film directed, filmed, edited and produced by Kirk F. Watson and written and co-directed by Matthew Edwards, both of whom star in the film. The film was released on 31 October 2012 and is the first full-length fictional film to have been shot in Antarctica.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film takes place in Antarctica, centering around a rescue team that was sent to the Routledge research station to investigate a research team's lack of communication with the outside world. Once there, the team discovers no survivors in the research station but finds a diary that describes the research team's last days. The diary goes over the research team's growing malcontent and paranoia as the team is picked off one by one by a mysterious killer.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nMathew Edwards as Rob\nKirk Watson as Gaz\nMelissa Langridge as Katrina\nDaniel Edmunds as Sam\nMatt Von Tersch as Frank\nTony McLaughlan as Phil\nShaun Scopes as Joe\nRiet Van de Velde as Luke\nJames Wake as Nicolas\nJonathon Yates as Doug\nDave Routledge as Mike\nMike Shortt\nTerri Souster as Sharon\nPaul Craske as Matt\n\n\n== Development ==\nWatson began working on the film while working for the British Antarctic Survey, seeing the film as a way to pass time and \"hone his film-making\". Matt Edwards initially wrote the script as a short story, but chose to adapt it into a screenplay. Fellow staff members made up the cast and crew, with Edwards and Watson both starring in the film. The crew used a children's face painting kit for makeup and utilized food coloring and syrup for fake blood.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nJoseph Wade of Something Awful panned the film, writing, \"South of Sanity is packed to the gills with every slasher clich\u00e9 in the book, and it rarely uses any of them well\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSouth of Sanity at IMDb\nThe 2022 Austin mayoral election was held on November 8, 2022, to elect the next mayor of Austin, Texas. The election was nonpartisan; candidates' party affiliations did not appear on the ballot. Incumbent mayor Steve Adler was term-limited and could not run for re-election. In the general election, state representative Celia Israel and former mayor Kirk Watson took the first two spots, leading realtor Jennifer Virden and several other candidates. Because no candidate received more than 50% of the vote, the race proceeded to a runoff election between Israel and Watson on December 13, which Watson won by 924 votes.\nDue to the passage of Proposition D in 2021, which scheduled mayoral elections in Austin to coincide with presidential elections, the winner of this election is to serve a shortened two-year term.\nThe election occurred concurrently with district city council races.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThough the election was officially nonpartisan, the runoff candidates, Celia Israel and Kirk Watson, were both affiliated with the Democratic Party. Jennifer Virden, who was third place, had a reputation of being conservative.\nSteven Pedigo, director of UT's LBJ Urban Lab, indicated that Watson's support was centralized with longtime residences of Austin in areas like the Northwest, and Israel's support was with younger demographics in growing and gentrifying areas of South and East Austin. According to Axios, Watson likely benefitted by the absence of Beto O'Rourke, who drew out younger and more progressive voters, from appearing on the runoff ballot. Furthermore, voters who supported more conservative Virden were more inclined to opt for Watson in the runoff.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\n\n\n=== Declared ===\nCraig Blanchard, business owner (party affiliation: Democratic)\nAnthony Bradshaw, security guard\nPhil Campero Brual, Legislative intern and University of Texas at Austin government student\nCelia Israel, state representative from the 50th district (party affiliation: Democratic)\nGary Spellman, business owner\nJennifer Virden, business owner and realtor\nKirk Watson, former president pro tempore of the Texas Senate from the 14th district and former mayor (party affiliation: Democratic)\n\n\n=== Withdrew ===\nErica Nix, fitness instructor, performance artist, and LGBT activist (endorsed Israel)\n\n\n=== Declined ===\nGreg Casar, city councilor (running for U.S. House)\nAdam Loewy, attorney\nKathie Tovo, city councilor\n\n\n== Endorsements ==\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== References ==\nKatharine Sarah Gallego (n\u00e9e Widland, born October 21, 1981) is an American politician serving as the 62nd mayor of Phoenix, Arizona, since 2019.

On November 5, 2013, Gallego was elected to the Phoenix City Council for the 8th district; she was reelected in 2017. With Greg Stanton, the Mayor of Phoenix, running for the United States House of Representatives in the 2018 elections, Gallego announced she would run in a special election to succeed him. She resigned from the city council effective August 7, 2018.\n\n\n=== Elections ===\nThe city of Phoenix has nonpartisan mayoral elections. In the 2018 special election, Kate Gallego and Daniel Valenzuela advanced to a runoff in November 2018. They defeated Moses Sanchez and Nicholas Sarwark. Although the election was nonpartisan, both candidates were Democrats. Previously on the city council, they had voted similarly. Kate Gallego defeated Daniel Valenzuela in the special general runoff election for the mayor of Phoenix in 2019. She received 58.6% of votes. She assumed office on March 21, 2019. She is only the second female mayor in Phoenix history and one of the youngest big city mayors in the United States.

In March 2024, Gallego announced her intention to run for re-election for another term.\n\n\n=== Climate change ===\nDuring Gallego's tenure as mayor, Phoenix has taken steps to counter the urban heat island effects which are aggravated by climate change. Increasing temperatures in the Phoenix area are projected to cost billions of dollars per year. Among the steps being taken are the creation of \"cool corridors\" through the planting of desert-adapted trees, and the use of lighter-colored sidewalks and streets, particularly in areas with high pedestrian traffic and little shade. Where to plant the trees is determined in part based on \"tree equity.\" The city uses an interactive tool from the nonprofit American Forests that grades shade in neighborhoods based on satellite images. Phoenix has also opened one of the first city heat mitigation offices in the United States. It will support climate mitigation in Phoenix and share strategies with individuals and cities worldwide.\n\n\n=== Policing ===\nThe police department of Phoenix recorded shooting 44 people in 2018, spurring a reassessment from the community on police accountability. In 2020, Gallego suggested a plan for a citizens review board that would balance the police department interests and community interests.

IBM followed in 1967, opening a facility to produce its Selectric typewriters. Texas Instruments was set up in Austin two years later, and Motorola (now NXP Semiconductors) started semiconductor chip manufacturing in 1974.

Kirk, and Chris Watson. Named for the Z\u00fcrich nightclub that fostered the early Dada movement, the band are often characterized as among the most innovative and influential electronic acts of their era.\nThe band's early work consisted of experimentation with DIY electronics and tape recorders, as well as Dada-influenced performance art, helping to pioneer industrial music in the mid-1970s. Finding an audience during the post-punk era, they gradually incorporated more conventional elements of synthpop, dance, house and funk styles. After Watson's departure in 1981, the group continued as a two-piece until disbanding in 1994. Kirk revived the name as a solo project from 2009 until his death in 2021.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation ===\nBy the early 1970s, Chris Watson of Sheffield, England, began experimenting with electronic devices to make \"music without musical instruments.\" Inspired by Brian Eno of Roxy Music, and helped along by his work as a telephone engineer, Watson's experimentation with tape loops evolved to include custom-built kit oscillators obtained by mail order by the time he met fellow Sheffield local and Eno devotee Richard Kirk. Kirk and Watson began exploring the intersection of technology and music, producing tapes loops to generate sound collages and unusual sound structures. Kirk began to add traditional instrumentation, including clarinet and guitar. In late 1973, they brought in Kirk's friend Stephen Mallinder to provide vocals and bass guitar. Some of these early experiments were first documented on the Industrial Records cassette 1974-1976 (1980), then later on the triple album CD set Methodology '74/'78: The Attic Tapes (Mute 2002).\nThe band eventually turned to live performance, often sharing the bill with Joy Division, though much of their earliest public performance tended more towards being unconventional and provocative stunts rather than conventional shows. The trio would deploy to various parts of Sheffield with their portable tape recorders and play their experimental compositions in places as diverse as public toilets and on the streets from loudspeakers on the top of a friend's van. This raucous and punkish attitude followed the band onstage to great effect; their first live concert in May 1975 ended in a fight between the band and the audience that sent Mallinder to hospital. In another incident, Mallinder was hospitalised with a chipped backbone after objects were thrown at the band. However, the arrival of punk rock brought a more accepting audience for their industrial, electronic sound and they were championed by Sheffield punk fanzine Gunrubber edited by Paul Bower of local band 2.3.\nIn 1977, Watson financed the establishment of the band's own recording studio on the second floor of a building called the Western Works on Portobello Street in Sheffield. The \"Western Works\" studio served as the band's studio for many years as well as providing a social gathering spot for the local Sheffield scene. Western Works produced some of the earliest recordings of pioneering local bands including Clock DVA, The Human League, and New Order.\n\n\n=== Emergence: Mix-Up to Red Mecca (1979\u20131981) ===\nIn 1978, Cabaret Voltaire signed to Rough Trade Records. Manchester-based Factory Records had offered to sign the band, and Throbbing Gristle were also interested in signing the band to Industrial Records, but it was with an offer of a four-track Revox tape machine (in lieu of an advance) that Rough Trade secured the deal. With Rough Trade, they released several acclaimed, musically experimental singles and EPs, including Extended Play and \"Nag Nag Nag\", and albums such as Three Mantras, The Voice of America in 1980 and Red Mecca in 1981.\nIn the 27 June 1978 edition of NME, Andy Gill said \"I firmly believe Cabaret Voltaire will turn out to be one of the most important new bands to achi\nStephen Ira Adler (born March 23, 1956) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the 58th mayor of Austin from 2015 to 2023.\nAdler has been a practicing attorney in Austin in the areas of eminent domain and civil rights law for 35 years.
