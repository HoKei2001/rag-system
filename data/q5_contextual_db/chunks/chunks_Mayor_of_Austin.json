        "content": "The mayor of Austin is the official head of the city of Austin in the U.S. state of Texas. The office was established in 1840 after Austin incorporated as a city in 1839. The mayor of Austin is elected to a four-year term and limited to serving no more than two terms.\nKirk Watson took office as mayor on January 6, 2023, for a second term, having served as mayor from 1997 to 2001.\n\n\n== Duties and powers ==\nAustin has a council–manager form of government which means day-to-day operations of the city are run by the city manager. The mayor is the head of city government ceremonially. The mayor is technically a member of the city council and is required to preside at all meetings. The mayor is also allowed to vote on all matters that come before the city council, but has no veto powers.\nAs of fiscal year 2022–2023, the salary for the mayor is set at $134,191.\n\n\n== Election ==\nThe mayor is elected in a citywide election. Currently, elections occur every four years during even-numbered years. Elections are non-partisan and by majority, but if no candidate receives a majority a run-off election is called between the top two candidates who received the most votes.\n\n\n== Succession ==\nPer city code of ordinances, if the mayor is absent or disabled, the Mayor Pro Tem is to act as mayor until the mayor returns or an election is held to fill the vacancy.\nThe mayor is subject to recall by registered voters if a petition is signed and filed that contains the signatures of 10 percent of the qualified voters. If the petition is verified, a recall election is called at the earliest convenient available date. If the recall passes, the mayor immediately vacates office. There are two limitations to the recall process. First, no recall petition can be filed until the mayor has been in office for at least six months. Second, the mayor will not be subject to more than one recall.\n\n\n== List of mayors of Austin ==\n\n\n== References ==\nThe 2024 Austin mayoral election will be held on November 5, 2024, to elect the next mayor of Austin, Texas. The election is nonpartisan; candidates' party affiliations will not appear on the ballot. Incumbent mayor Kirk Watson is running for re-election, after returning to the position of mayor following the 2022 election. \nDue to the passage of Prop D in 2021, this is the first Austin mayoral election to coincide with a presidential election.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\n\n\n=== Declared ===\nJeffery Bowen, member of the Austin Board of Adjustment\nDoug Greco, nonprofit executive and author of To Find a Killer (party affiliation: Democratic)\nCarmen Llanes Pulido, former Austin Planning Commission member (party affiliation: Democratic)\nKathie Tovo, former city councilor from the 9th district (2011–2023) (party affiliation: Democratic)\nKirk Watson, incumbent mayor (party affiliation: Democratic)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial campaign websites for mayoral candidates\nJeff Bowen for Mayor\nDave Greco (D) for Mayor\nCarmen Llanes Pulido (D) for Mayor\nKathie Tovo (D) for Mayor\nKirk Watson (D) for Mayor\nBallotpedia - Mayoral election in Austin, Texas (2024)\nThe 2022 Austin mayoral election was held on November 8, 2022, to elect the next mayor of Austin, Texas. The election was nonpartisan; candidates' party affiliations did not appear on the ballot. Incumbent mayor Steve Adler was term-limited and could not run for re-election. In the general election, state representative Celia Israel and former mayor Kirk Watson took the first two spots, leading realtor Jennifer Virden and several other candidates. Because no candidate received more than 50% of the vote, the race proceeded to a runoff election between Israel and Watson on December 13, which Watson won by 924 votes.\nDue to the passage of Proposition D in 2021, which scheduled mayoral elections in Austin to coincide with presidential elections, the winner of this election is to serve a shortened two-year term.\nThe election occurred concurrently with district city council races.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThough the election was officially nonpartisan, the runoff candidates, Celia Israel and Kirk Watson, were both affiliated with the Democratic Party. Jennifer Virden, who was third place, had a reputation of being conservative.\nSteven Pedigo, director of UT's LBJ Urban Lab, indicated that Watson's support was centralized with longtime residences of Austin in areas like the Northwest, and Israel's support was with younger demographics in growing and gentrifying areas of South and East Austin. According to Axios, Watson likely benefitted by the absence of Beto O'Rourke, who drew out younger and more progressive voters, from appearing on the runoff ballot. Furthermore, voters who supported more conservative Virden were more inclined to opt for Watson in the runoff.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\n\n\n=== Declared ===\nCraig Blanchard, business owner (party affiliation: Democratic)\nAnthony Bradshaw, security guard\nPhil Campero Brual, Legislative intern and University of Texas at Austin government student\nCelia Israel, state representative from the 50th district (party affiliation: Democratic)\nGary Spellman, business owner\nJennifer Virden, business owner and realtor\nKirk Watson, former president pro tempore of the Texas Senate from the 14th district and former mayor (party affiliation: Democratic)\n\n\n=== Withdrew ===\nErica Nix, fitness instructor, performance artist, and LGBT activist (endorsed Israel)\n\n\n=== Declined ===\nGreg Casar, city councilor (running for U.S. House)\nAdam Loewy, attorney\nKathie Tovo, city councilor\n\n\n== Endorsements ==\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== References ==\nStephen Ira Adler (born March 23, 1956) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the 58th mayor of Austin from 2015 to 2023.\nAdler has been a practicing attorney in Austin in the areas of eminent domain and civil rights law for 35 years.  For eight years he worked as the chief of staff and later general counsel to Democratic State Senator Eliot Shapleigh in the Texas Legislature. He has also worked with or board chaired Austin-based nonprofits and civic organizations, including the Texas Tribune, Anti-Defamation League, and Ballet Austin.\nA Democrat, Adler was elected to be mayor of Austin in the 2014 mayoral race and was sworn in on January 6, 2015; he was re-elected in 2018. He was the first mayor of Austin to serve under the 10-ONE council system. During Adler's tenure he lifted a ban on camping, sitting, or lying down in public causing Texas governor Greg Abbott to threaten the deployment of state resources to combat the move. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Adler declared a local state of emergency and cancelled Austin's annual SXSW events in 2020. He came under controversy for flying in his private plane to Cabo San Lucas while urging people in Austin to stay home amid rising cases of COVID-19.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nSteve Adler was born to a Jewish family and first lived in Washington, D.C. and grew up in Kensington, Maryland.  His father was a World War II veteran with the U.S. Navy who later became a film editor with CBS News.  His mother was a homemaker.\nIn 1978, he graduated from Princeton University with a B.A. from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.  He then attended the University of Texas at Austin School of Law and received his juris doctor in 1982.  After graduating from the University of Texas, Adler remained in Austin to practice law.\n\n\n== Legal career ==\nIn the mid-1980s, Steve Adler co-founded the Barron, Graham & Adler LLP law firm, later Barron & Adler, LLP. He represented primarily landowners who were dealing with eminent domain and condemnation cases where the government or a private company seek to acquire their property.  In addition to this practice, Adler spent most of the 1980s, his early legal career, doing civil rights employment discrimination cases.  This work included representing women as well as Hispanic, African American and other minority workers in federal court, before the Equal Employment and Opportunity Commission and on matters filed with the Austin Human Rights Commission.  He represented clients seeking equal treatment and opportunity in the workplace, redress from sexual harassment and denial of equal pay for equal work.\nAdler has argued before state appellate courts, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and the Texas Supreme Court and was named a Texas Super Lawyer from 2007 to 2013 and one of the Best Lawyers in America in 2007–2014.\n\n\n== Early political career ==\nIn 1996, Steve Adler assisted El Paso Democrat Eliot Shapleigh in his run for Texas State Senate.  He then served as Senator Shapleigh's chief of staff and later general counsel from 1997 to 2005.\nDuring Adler's time working in the Texas Senate, he primarily focused on fairness in school funding formulas, teachers' salary issues, state budget policy, environmental protection, and equity and access issues.\n\n\n== Mayor of Austin (2015–2023) ==\n\n\n=== Elections ===\n\nSteve Adler began his campaign in January 2014 for Austin Mayor and ran on a platform of reforming governance at the Austin City Council.  His primary issues included governance, traffic congestion, education, affordability, environment and water, and neighborhoods. Adler entered into a run-off with City Council Member Mike Martinez in November after both candidates failed to get a majority of votes. Adler won the run-off on December 16, 2014, with 67% percent of the total vote.\nAdler won reelection in 2018, garnering 59% of the vote in a 7-way race. He was ineligible to run for reelectio\nKirk Preston Watson (born March 18, 1958) is an American attorney and politician who has served as the 59th mayor of Austin since 2023, previously holding the office as the 54th mayor from 1997 to 2001. A member of the Democratic Party, he ran unsuccessfully for Texas attorney general in the 2002 election, where he was defeated by Republican Greg Abbott, later governor of Texas. In 2006, Watson was elected to the Texas Senate from District 14.\nIn 2011, Watson was chosen by his Democratic colleagues to chair the Senate Democratic Caucus and served until 2015. On the first day of the 86th Texas Legislature, he was chosen by his colleagues—Democrats and Republicans—to serve as president pro tempore. The position typically goes to the most senior member, regardless of party, who has not yet served as president pro tem, and is second in line of succession to the Governor.\nIt was announced by the Austin American-Statesman that Watson had planned to resign from the Texas Senate to become the first dean of the University of Houston's Hobby School of Public Affairs. His resignation was effective April 30, 2020. With incumbent Mayor Steve Adler not seeking another term, Watson entered the race to become Austin mayor for a second time. He was elected for his second stint as mayor in the 2022 Austin mayoral election runoff with 50.4% of the vote.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWatson was born in Oklahoma City and raised in Saginaw, Texas, a suburb of Fort Worth, where he attended Boswell High School. He received a bachelor's degree in political science in 1980 and a Juris Doctor in 1981 from Baylor University in Waco, Texas. At Baylor Law School, Watson was editor-in-chief of the Baylor Law Review and graduated first in his class. He subsequently clerked for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n\n\n== Early political career ==\nWatson was elected president of the Texas Young Lawyers Association in 1990 and served on the executive committee of the State Bar of Texas. Watson was an active Democrat throughout the 1990s and served as the chairman of the Travis County Democratic Party.\nIn 1991, Watson was appointed by Governor Ann Richards to serve as chairman of the Texas Air Control Board, the state agency that was charged with protecting air quality in Texas.  During his tenure, he worked to merge the agency with the Texas Air Control Board and the Texas Water Commission to form the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission, and oversaw implementation of the 1991 amendments to the federal Clean Air Act.\nIn 1994, he was named the Outstanding Young Lawyer of Texas. In 1997, Watson co-founded the Austin law firm of Watson Bishop London & Galow, creating a broad law practice that represented families, doctors, small businesses, and some of the state's major universities.\n\n\n== First term as Mayor of Austin (1997–2001) ==\nIn 1997, after Watson moved from Rollingwood to Austin, he was elected as the 54th mayor of Austin, a nonpartisan position. He ran on a pledge to build consensus in a city that was then dominated by political battles between environmentalists and developers. He campaigned to raise more than $78 million for land preservation and $300 million for transportation improvements. Watson's signature accomplishments as mayor included the transformation of Downtown Austin into a \"24-hour downtown\" by encouraging development of housing and retail in place of vacant warehouses and parking lots, partially through tax incentives and the city's Smart Growth initiatives.\nIn 1999, Watson spearheaded a redevelopment project along several blocks of waterfront property in Downtown Austin, in an effort to create a new public-private \"digital district\" in place of dilapidated warehouses and businesses including the former Liberty Lunch, which were demolished. Watson, along with architect Larry Speck, courted the Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) by offering a $10.4 million tax incentive to anchor two office buildings on the site in\nThe 2018 Austin mayoral election was held on November 6, 2018, to elect the mayor of Austin, Texas. The election was a non-partisan mayoral election. If a candidate received a majority of the votes (50%+1 or greater), the candidate was elected, otherwise a runoff would be held between the top two candidates with the most votes. As incumbent Steve Adler secured a majority in the first round, a runoff was not required, and Adler was re-elected mayor for a second term.\n\n\n== Campaign ==\nAdler entered the election with a strong fundraising advantage over his challengers.\nAdler's most formidable challenger was perceived to be former Austin City Council member Laura Morrison. Morrison had been a prominent critic of CodeNEXT (a shelved effort to rewrite the city's land development code) and the deal Adler was offering to bring a Major League Soccer team to the city.\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n== References ==\nThe Austin City Council is the unicameral legislature of the city of Austin, Texas, United States of America. The mayor is included as a member of the council and presides over all council meetings and ceremonies. The current mayor of Austin is Kirk Watson. The duty of the council is to decide the city budget, taxes, and various other ordinances. While the council is officially nonpartisan, all but one current council member are affiliated with the Democratic Party.\nBefore 2012, the council was composed of six at-large elected members and the mayor, and members could only serve three terms (nine years) on the council. However, in 2012 the citizens of Austin approved two propositions that established ten single-member districts within the city and assigned council and mayoral seats staggered four-year terms, with members limited to two terms. However, the mayor remains as the 11th member on the council, an arrangement known as 10-1. The new setup was first implemented after the 2014 elections.\n\n\n== Duties ==\nThe duty of the Austin City Council is to oversee and decide on the city budget, local taxes, amendment of laws, and creation of ordinances and policies. The council members meet every Thursday. There are several boards and commissions that are composed of non-elected appointed citizens to give advice and recommendations to council members. These board generally review, debate, and comment on recommendations for the council.\n\n\n== Members ==\nMembers of the council are elected to 4 years terms and can serve a maximum of 2 terms. The current council was elected in 2022. The council is officially nonpartisan; however, all but one current council members and the mayor are affiliated with the Democratic Party.\n\n\n== Notable Past Members ==\nGreg Casar (D), U.S. Representative (2023-present)\nSheryl Cole (D), State Representative (2019-present)\nDelia Garza (D), Travis County Attorney (2021-present)\nJimmy Flannigan (D), Austin councilmember (2017-2021), first openly gay city council member in Austin history\nBrigid Shea (D), Travis County Commissioner (2017-present)\nEllen Troxclair (R), State Representative (2023-present)\n\n\n== History ==\nThe city of Austin was officially incorporated by the Fourth Congress of the Republic of Texas on December 27, 1839. The city was established at the confluence of the Colorado River and Shoal Creek, which was then the site of a small community known as Waterloo. The city was founded to act as the capital of the Republic of Texas and was named in honor of Stephen F. Austin, the so-called Founder of Texas. The governmental structure established by the original Austin charter called for \"one mayor, and eight Aldermen\", with the mayor being elected city-wide, and each Alderman representing one of the city's eight wards. Austin had its first mayoral election on January 13, 1840, in which citizens elected Edwin Waller to be the city's first mayor.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCouncil Meeting Information\nWilliam Patrick Wynn (born September 10, 1961) is an American businessman and politician, who was the mayor of Austin, Texas from 2003 to 2009.\n\n\n== Family ==\nBorn and raised in Beaumont, Texas, Wynn was the sixth of seven children. He attended Texas A&M University, where he graduated cum laude with a degree in Environmental Design in 1984. Although Wynn was born in East Texas, his family's roots in Austin and Central Texas run deep; two of his great-great-great grandparents, James and Julia Olive, settled in southern Williamson County in 1843.\nHis great-grandfather, Daniel LeMaster of McDade, was the state representative for Bastrop County in the 1920s. Will's great-uncle, Ridley Ott, built and managed the Checker Front General Store, now FreshPlus, at 43rd and Duval in Hyde Park during the 1930s and 40s.\nSome of his family's history in Central Texas can be seen in several books by J. Frank Dobie, including \"Cow People\" and \"The Longhorns\"; \"The Ladder of Rivers\" by Harry Chrisman; \"Black Cowboys of Texas\" by Sara Massey, \"Four on a Limb\" and \"I'll Die Before I'll Run\" by C.L. Sonnichsen; and \"The Shooters\" by Leon Metz.\nHe first moved to Austin in 1981. Will is the father of two daughters.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nWynn has over 20 years of experience in the commercial real estate industry, with projects large and small, including the $40 million redevelopment of the Frost Bank Plaza on Congress Avenue in Downtown Austin. In 1997, Will founded CIVITAS Investments, Inc. to focus on historic restoration projects. He is a member of the Urban Land Institute and believes that only through dramatically better land use practices can Austin and the surrounding region appropriately deal with challenges like traffic, air quality, housing affordability and environmental protection. In 2001, he was one of the founding members of, what became, Envision Central Texas. Will has also worked over the years to build support for numerous local causes and organizations.\nPrior to being elected to the Austin City Council in 2000, Wynn served as Chair of the Downtown Austin Alliance, in addition to acting as Director of the Children's Museum and Heritage Society of Austin. He has long been a leading advocate for transforming downtown Austin into the most vibrant urban core in the country.\n\n\n== Mayor of Austin ==\nAustin voters elected Wynn to be Austin's fiftieth mayor on May 3, 2003, replacing Gus Garcia. He was re-elected three years later on May 15, 2006 with over 78 percent of the vote. The front-runner from the start, Wynn garnered most of the endorsements and raised much more money than his two competitors, Council Member Danny Thomas, and Jennifer Gale. He also received a boost from the strong leadership credited to him when Hurricane Katrina evacuees came to Austin in 2005.\nAs Austin Mayor, Will Wynn served as Chairman of the Board of Directors for Austin Energy, the 9th largest public power utility in the United States. As such, Mayor Wynn presided over the nation's most successful utility-sponsored green power program (for the 4th consecutive year according to the U.S. Dep't of Energy), an award-winning energy efficiency program that has eliminated the need for a 500-megawatt, coal-burning power plant near Austin, and a greenbuilding program that was the first of its kind in the world and served as the genesis for the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and the national greenbuilding movement. Austin Energy has assets of over $3.5 billion, annual revenues of $1.2 billion, almost 1,500 employees and generates up to 3,000 megawatts of electricity. Its fuel mix is 35% natural gas, 29% coal, 23% nuclear and 11% renewables (mostly wind).\nWynn was succeeded as mayor by Lee Leffingwell, who was sworn in on June 22, 2009.\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nWill was named Austinite of the Year by Austin Under Forty (back when he was under 40); was awarded Scenic Austin's first annual Scenic Hero Award; was named Energy Executive of the Year by the Association of Energy \nAustin (  AW-stin) is the capital of the U.S. state of Texas and the seat and most populous city of Travis County, with portions extending into Hays and Williamson counties. Incorporated on December 27, 1839, it is the 26th-largest metropolitan area in the United States, the 11th-most populous city in the United States, the fourth-most populous city in the state after Houston, San Antonio, and Dallas, and the second-most populous state capital city after Phoenix, the capital of Arizona. It has been one of the fastest growing large cities in the United States since 2010. Downtown Austin and Downtown San Antonio are approximately 80 miles (129 km) apart, and both fall along the Interstate 35 corridor. This combined metropolitan region of San Antonio–Austin has approximately 5 million people. Austin is the southernmost state capital in the contiguous United States and is considered a Gamma + level global city as categorized by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\nAs of 2024, Austin had an estimated population of 984,567, up from 961,855 at the 2020 census. The city is the cultural and economic center of the Austin–Round Rock metropolitan statistical area, which had an estimated population of 2,473,275 as of July 1, 2023. Located in Central Texas within the greater Texas Hill Country, it is home to numerous lakes, rivers, and waterways, including Lady Bird Lake and Lake Travis on the Colorado River, Barton Springs, McKinney Falls, and Lake Walter E. Long.\nResidents of Austin are known as Austinites. They include a diverse mix of government employees, college students, musicians, high-tech workers, and blue-collar workers. The city's official slogan promotes Austin as \"The Live Music Capital of the World\", a reference to the city's many musicians and live music venues, as well as the long-running PBS TV concert series Austin City Limits. Austin is the site of South by Southwest (SXSW), an annual conglomeration of parallel film, interactive media, and music festivals. The city also adopted \"Silicon Hills\" as a nickname in the 1990s due to a rapid influx of technology and development companies. In recent years, some Austinites have adopted the unofficial slogan \"Keep Austin Weird\", which refers to the desire to protect small, unique, and local businesses from being overrun by large corporations. Since the late 19th century, Austin has also been known as the \"City of the Violet Crown\", because of the colorful glow of light across the hills just after sunset.\nEmerging from a strong economic focus on government and education, since the 1990s, Austin has become a center for technology and business. The technology roots in Austin can be traced back to the 1960s, when defense electronics contractor Tracor (now BAE Systems) began operations in the city in 1962. IBM followed in 1967, opening a facility to produce its Selectric typewriters. Texas Instruments was set up in Austin two years later, and Motorola (now NXP Semiconductors) started semiconductor chip manufacturing in 1974. A number of Fortune 500 companies have headquarters or regional offices in Austin, including 3M, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Agilent Technologies, Amazon, Apple, Dell, Facebook (Meta), General Motors, Google, IBM, Intel, NXP Semiconductors, Oracle, Tesla, and Texas Instruments. With regard to education, Austin is the home of the University of Texas at Austin, one of the largest universities in the U.S., with over 50,000 students. In 2021, Austin became home to the Austin FC, the first (and currently only) major professional sports team in the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAustin, Travis County and Williamson County have been the site of human habitation since at least 9200 BC. The area's earliest known inhabitants lived during the late Pleistocene (Ice Age) and are linked to the Clovis culture around 9200 BC (over 11,200 years ago), based on evidence found throughout the area and documented at the much-studied Gault Site, midway between Georgetown and Fo\nGustavo L. \"Gus\" García (January 23, 1934 – December 17, 2018) was an American politician who served as the second Hispanic mayor of Austin, Texas.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nGarcía was born in 1934 in Zapata, Texas, a poor border town, where his father ran a small grocery store. When he was 10, he moved to Laredo with his mother and siblings, where he enrolled in 7th grade.\nGarcía enlisted in the United States Army in 1954. When García returned to Laredo, he married Marina Gonzalez in 1957. Shortly thereafter, they moved to Austin, where he enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin. He soon encountered discrimination, and was barred from fraternities.\nGarcía earned a bachelor's degree in business administration in 1959. García opened his own company, and for years, García was the only Hispanic accountant in town.\n\n\n== Public service ==\n\n\n=== Human Rights Commission ===\nIn 1967 Garcia was selected as the only Hispanic for the 21-member Human Relations Commission, (later renamed Human Rights Commission).\nThe commission's work included housing and employment discrimination, \nas well as education, police-community relations, ambulance service, and the Economy Furniture strike. Garcia investigated and helped expose discrimination at the Austin Housing Authority.\nBuilding upon this work he helped write a Fair Housing Ordinance, which was passed in 1968 by the City Council, however the Austin Board of Realtors (ABOR) soon lead a petition drive and the ordinance was repealed in a citywide vote.\nGarcia served two years on the Commission and left when his term expired in 1969.\n\n\n=== Austin School Board ===\nAfter leaving the commission, García continued to be involved in politics and the ongoing civil rights struggle. He turned his attention to the Austin school board. In 1971 the first African-American school board member, Wilhelmina R. Delco, led a failed effort to appoint García to the board to fill an unexpired term. He ran for an open seat in 1972 and won.\nThe practice of desegregation busing had begun, but the Austin school district resisted, fighting a federal discrimination order in court. The school district had been found in violation of the 1964.\nGarcía, who had three children enrolled in Austin schools, supported court-ordered busing. However a majority of the board fought the busing decree in court, including Carole Keeton Strayhorn, who was the school board president. García consistently voted against the school district's appeals of the discrimination lawsuit.\nIn 1975 García won a second term to the board and fellow board members chose him as president of the board. At the end of his second term in 1978 he left office. He ran for the State Board of Education in 1978 and 1982, losing both times to Will Davis. After his attempts to win statewide office, García turned his focus to his accounting business.\n\n\n=== City Council ===\nGarcía first ran for Austin City Council in 1991. On May 4, he won a majority of the votes and advanced to a run-off. On May 18, 1991 he beat Gilbert Martinez to secure a seat on the council. He was reelected in 1994 to Place 5 and again in 1997, to Place 2.\nOnce on the council, García closed his CPA business and focused himself on his council work, beginning with youth and housing programs. For example, he successfully helped start an anti-graffiti program that also provides family counseling to counter poverty and patterns of alienation. His efforts yielded numerous East Austin facilities, like the Cepeda Branch Library, the Zavala recreation center, Plaza Saltillo, the Mexican American Cultural Center and Tillery Square, an affordable housing development. Austin–Bergstrom International Airport was completed during his tenure on the council. When deregulation proponents proposed the city sell its public electric utility, García was key in keeping what is now Austin Energy in the public's hands. García supported the successful acquisition of significant acreage for nature preserves and parks.\nAfter being\nThe 2024 Austin, Texas municipal elections will take place on Tuesday, November 5, 2024. Five city council seats (District 2, District 4, District 6, District 7, and District 10) and the mayor have regular elections.

She lost the November general election to Perry and placed third in a six-way race, with 18 percent.\nKeeton is notable for several firsts in Austin and Texas politics. She is the first and so far only woman elected as mayor of Austin and the first Austin mayor elected to three consecutive terms. She was the first woman elected to the Texas Railroad Commission and the first woman elected as comptroller. She also was the first woman to serve as president of the Austin school board and as president of the Austin Community College board.\nIn May 2009, Keeton lost her campaign for Mayor of Austin.\n\n\n== Family ==\nKeeton was born Carole Stewart Keeton in Austin, the second child and only daughter of Madge Anna (Stewart) and W. Page Keeton, a lawyer and university dean. She attended the University of Texas at Austin, where she was a member of the Orange Jackets, a women's honorary service organization. Her father was the longtime dean of the University of Texas Law School.\nKeeton's first marriage was to attorney Barr McClellan, whom she divorced during her first term as mayor. The marriage produced four sons, Scott, Mark, Brad and Dudley McClellan. Upon her subsequent remarriage, she took the last name of her new husband, accordingly elected as comptroller under the name Carole Keeton Rylander. She married Ed Strayhorn in 2003, continuing her career as Carole Keeton Strayhorn.  She resumed her maiden name by 2014, after her third marriage ended in divorce.\n\n\n== Early political career ==\nAs Carole Keeton McClellan, she served on the board of trustees of the Austin Independent School District (which doubled as the Board of Trustees of Austin Community College) from 1972 to 1977. She served as president of both boards from 1976 to 1977. She was elected mayor of Austin in 1977 and held that post until 1983. In 1983, Governor Mark White appointed Rylander to the State Board of Insurance, where she served until resigning in 1986 to unsuccessfully challenge veteran Democratic congressman, J. J. Pickle of Austin, a longtime friend and political ally of Lyndon B. Johnson.\nAs Carole Keeton Rylander, she won election to the Texas Railroad Commission in 1994 by beating Democratic incumbent Mary Scott Nabers, an Ann W. Richards appointee, by almost 300,000 votes. The panel primarily regulates the production of oil and natural gas, and despite its name, no longer has authority over railroads. She served as commission chairman from November 1995 to January 1997, and from June 1998 to January 1999.\n\n\n== Comptroller ==\nIn 1998, Keeton entered the open race to succeed outgoing Democratic Comptroller John Sharp of Victoria, who was seeking the lieutenant governorship. Facing off against Democratic political scion Paul Hobby, the son of a former lieutenant governor, Keeton won by some 20,000 votes out of roughly 3.6 million votes cast.\nReelected in 2002, she led the statewide Republican ticket in terms of raw votes. As Carole Keeton Rylander, she drew more than one million votes more in 2002 than she had four years earlier and outpolled fellow Republican Rick Perry by some 246,000 votes even while Perry was easily dispatching Democrat Tony Sanchez of Laredo in the governor's race.\nThe tax status of Ethical Societies as religious organizations has been upheld in court cases in Washington, D.C. (1957), and in Austin, Texas (2003).

The population was 482 at the 2020 census.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn September 1856, Edward Orramel Austin came to Freeman Run. He fell in love with the area and began to build a village. From then on, he lived his entire life in the valley. He served in the Civil War and returned to his valley after. His dream grew until his town, at one period, was one of the largest in Potter County. At the time of his death in 1908, the town of Austin was at its most productive with paper mills and saw mills as well. He lived to see a great dream come true. Two years later, nearly the entire town was swept away when the great dam built by the Bayless Pulp and Paper Company failed to hold back its 500,000,000+ gallons of water. The home of E.O. Austin went with it.\nThe building is a replica of E.O. Austin’s house of the 1800’s.  It is in almost the exact spot as it was before the flood of 1911.  The inside of the home is a museum filled with memorabilia from Austin and the surrounding areas (Wharton, Keating Summit and Odin). The goal of “The New, Oldest Home in Austin” is to preserve our own town’s history – past, present, and future.\n\n\n=== 1911 dam failure ===\n\nThe Austin Dam, also known as the Bayless Dam, was a concrete gravity dam for the Bayless Pulp and Paper Mill. Built in 1909, it was the largest dam of its type in Pennsylvania at the time. The catastrophic failure of the dam on September 30, 1911, destroyed much of the town and killed 78 people. The town was rebuilt, under the slogan \"the town too tough to die\". This was later changed to \"the best town by a dam site\".\n\n\n=== Mayoral controversy, 2021 ===\nOn November 9, 2021, Kate Crosby won the mayoral election against Jim Setzer. They received 38 and 30 votes, respectively. On July 7, 2021, Crosby pleaded guilty for the felony crime of aggravated assault by vehicle on December 21, 2014, which resulted in the death of one and the maiming of another man. The Potter Leader-Enterprise wrote that Crosby's felony conviction may render her ineligible to hold office as mayor, because the Pennsylvania Constitution bars anyone convicted of an \"infamous crime\" from holding office in Pennsylvania. Once in office, the DA or attorney general would need to file a quo warranto to remove her. On June 7, 2022, the Austin Borough Council followed Judge Stephen Minor's court decision to remove Kate Crosby as mayor of Austin. During a special meeting on June 30, the Austin borough council unanimously appointed James Setzer as mayor.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 4.0 square miles (10.4 km2), all land.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of the 2020 United States Census there were 482 people, 230 households in the borough. The population density was 119.6 people per square mile (46/km2). There were 266 housing units at an average density of 65.8 per square mile (25.4/km2).  \nThe racial makeup of the borough was 96.68% White, 0.41% Hispanic or Latino, 0.21% Asian, 0%  Black or African American, 0%  American Indian and Alaska Native, 0% Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander 0.21% some other race, and 0.29% from two or more races.\nThere were 230 households, 25.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 50.4% were married couples living together, 30.9% had a female householder with no spouse present, and 13.9% had a female householder with no spouse present. The average household size was 3.49.\nIn the borough the population by age range was 6.8% under the age of 5, 19% from age 5 to 18, 56.2 % from age 18 to 64, and 18% 65 or older. The median age was 39.6 years. \nThe median household income was $48,750. The median income for families was $60,417, median income for married-couple families was $71,071, and median income for non-family households was $30,817.\nPoverty, 3.2% of the population in Austin were below the poverty line, compared to 12.\nThe 2014 Austin mayoral election was held on November 4 and December 16, 2014 to elect the mayor of Austin, Texas.

Prior to his 1971 election, Austin mayors had been appointed by the Austin City Council.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nRoy Butler was a native of Greenville, Texas.\n He was the only child of his mother, a homemaker, and his father, an officer in the United States Army.\nButler served in the United States Navy during World War II. Following his departure from the Navy, Butler earned his bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Texas at Austin in 1951. He attended the University of Texas School of Law for three years but left before earning his law degree. Instead, he entered the automobile business.\nHe met his future wife, Ann Showers, on a blind date while at the University of Texas. The couple married six months later.\nButler was described as a close friend of former U. S. President Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\n\n== Business career ==\nOutside of city politics, Butler owned and operated several prolific Austin area businesses. He opened his first car dealership at 45th and Lamar in Austin. The business grew to become the Roy Butler Lincoln-Mercury dealership. Butler owned the dealership from 1960 until 1976, during which Butler Lincoln-Mercury became the largest Lincoln dealership in Texas and Oklahoma.\nButler won the rights to the Coors Beer franchise in Central Texas in 1976, beating out approximately 2,200 other applicants. His Coors beer distributor franchise, now called Capitol Beverage, currently distributes more than forty beer brands throughout four Texas counties, as of 2009 in Caldwell, Hays, Travis, and Williamson counties.\nButler co-founded the local branch of Cellular One, which is now known as AT&T Wireless. Cellular One was the first cell phone provider in Austin. He also owned two Austin area radio stations, KVET and KASE-FM. Under Butler, KVET and KASE-FM expanded into a multi-state radio group, which Butler sold in 1999.\nFormer Austin Mayor Bruce Todd credited Butler as one of the real estate developers most responsible for transforming Downtown Austin. Butler established some of the first, and most important commercial developments in the neighborhood, which eventually attracted new residents and businesses to the area. Butler was responsible for leasing a building he owned at the corner of Sixth and Lamar to both Whole Foods Markets and the GSD&M Idea City ad agency, both of which are headquartered in Austin. With the addition of another tenant, Book People, Butler's property became an important site which attracted people to downtown Austin.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nButler served as a member of the Austin independent school District board for nine years prior to being elected to his first term as mayor in 1971.\nButler unseated Mayor Travis LaRue 65.3 to 15 percent. He was handily re-elected for a second two-year term as mayor in 1973, when he received almost 44,000 votes. This total from 1973 still holds the record for most votes ever cast for any Austin mayoral candidate in history, as of 2019.\nButler expanded and modernized the Austin Police Department. He also spearheaded efforts to build a nuclear power plant in South Texas and construct the Texas State Highway Loop 1 (MoPac Boulevard) on the west side of Austin. The two proposals brought Butler into political conflict with Austin's environmentalists, who had emerged as a force in the city during the 1960s and 1970s.\nDuring his tenure as mayor, Butler was able to recruit former United States First Lady Lady Bird Johnson to team up with his wife, Ann Butler, to establish the Town Lake Beautification Committee. Before Ann Butler and First Lady Johnson began their work the lake, located in Austin, was in a state of neglect and polluted with trash and overgrown weeds.

A member of the Democratic Party, Leffingwell previously served as chair of Austin's Environmental Board.\nHe was first elected to the Austin City Council in 2005, and won re-election in 2008. He was elected mayor in 2009, and re-elected to a second three-year term on May 12, 2012, with over 52% of the vote.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nLeffingwell is a native of Austin, and grew up in the Bouldin neighborhood of South Austin. He graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in mechanical engineering. His father was an Austin firefighter and later a Travis County Deputy Sheriff and his mother worked as an admissions clerk at UT.\nPrior to serving as an elected official, Leffingwell was officer and pilot in the United States Navy and commercial airline pilot. After spending five years on active duty, including Vietnam service, Leffingwell joined the Navy Reserves, completing a total of 20 years military service. He was a pilot for Delta Air Lines for almost 32 years, ending his airline career as an international Boeing 767 and MD-11 Captain.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter retiring from Delta, Lee volunteered in Austin, working on environmental issues. He was appointed to the Environmental Board by the Austin City Council in 1999, and subsequently elected Chair by his colleagues. In 2005, he ran for city council, suffering through the death of his wife just two weeks before election day. In 2008 he won re-election for the Place 1 seat.\nLeffingwell became mayor of Austin in the 2009 election when his opponent Brewster McCracken, a distant second place contender in the initial round, voluntarily dropped out of the run-off election. He ran on a platform of increased public transparency, investment in transportation infrastructure, and support of small business. Throughout his career, Leffingwell has paid particular interest to environmental concerns, including water conservation, banning plastic grocery bags and supporting Austin environmental symbol Barton Springs.\nHe was reelected mayor in 2012. Leffingwell endorsed Steve Adler for Austin Mayor during the 2014 Mayoral election even though colleagues Mike Martinez and Sheryl Cole were running.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe 2009 Austin mayoral election was held on May 9, 2009.

The area of the district is bound by Lamar Boulevard to the west, Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to the north, Interstate 35 to the east, and Lady Bird Lake to the south.\nDowntown Austin is where most of the city's high-rise buildings are located, as well as being the center of government and business for the region. It is currently experiencing a building boom, with many condos and high-rise towers being built. The top three tallest condo buildings west of the Mississippi River are all located in downtown Austin: The Independent, The Austonian, and the 360 Condominiums.\nDowntown Austin and Downtown San Antonio are approximately 80 miles (129 km) apart, and both fall along the Interstate 35 corridor. This combined metropolitan region of San Antonio–Austin has approximately 5 million people.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe story of Downtown Austin began with the Republic of Texas and President Mirabeau B. Lamar in the 1830s. Lamar tapped Edwin Waller to direct the planning and construction of the new town. Waller chose a site on a bluff above the Colorado River, nestled between Shoal Creek to the west and Waller Creek to the east. Waller and a team of surveyors developed Austin's first city plan, commonly known as the Waller Plan, dividing the site into a simple grid pattern on a 640-acre (or one square-mile plot) with 14 blocks running in both directions. Much of this original design is still intact in downtown Austin today.\nOne grand avenue, which Lamar named \"Congress\", cut through the center of town from Capitol Square down to the Colorado River. The streets running north–south (paralleling Congress) were named for Texas rivers with their order of placement matching the order of rivers on the Texas state map. The east–west streets were named after trees native to the region, despite the fact that Waller had recommended using numbers (they were eventually changed to numbers in 1884). The city's perimeters stretched north to south from the river at 1st Street to 15th Street, and from East Avenue (now Interstate 35) to West Avenue.\nWaller reserved key spots for public buildings and four public squares. Three of Waller's original squares survive to this day: Wooldridge Park, Republic Square and Brush Square.\n\n\n== Downtown districts ==\n\n\n=== Congress Avenue ===\n\nEdwin Waller, the first mayor of Austin, designed Congress Avenue to be Austin's most prominent street. Planned as the widest street in the original 1839 Austin plan, the 120-foot wide Congress Avenue initially ran from the Colorado River north to the State Capitol. Not coincidentally, Congress was the most important street in Austin city life during the 19th century. Early structures along Congress Avenue included government buildings, hotels, saloons, retail stores and restaurants. By the late 1840s \"The Avenue\" formed a well-established business district. The mid-1870s introduced gaslight illumination and mule-driven streetcars as well as construction of a new Travis County courthouse at Eleventh Street.\nStretching from First Street north to Eleventh Street, the Congress Avenue Historic District was created on August 11, 1978. Stylistically, the dominating structures of significance reflected general Victorian form and detailing, tempered by local materials and building techniques. Notable structures along Congress Avenue north of the Colorado include the Texas State Capitol, Paramount Theatre, the Scarbrough and Littlefield Buildings, the Southwestern Telegraph and Telephone Building, Gethsemane Lutheran Church and the Old Bakery.\n\n\n=== Second Street District ===\nThe Second Street District is an entertainment and shopping district in Downtown Austin, just north of Lady Bird Lake and an area of great focus for development for the city, particularly between 2000–2012. Stretching six city blocks, notable buildings and complexes located within the district include Austin City Hall and Block 21, a mi\nCarlton Lee Cooke (born 1944) is an American politician and businessman who served as the 52nd mayor of Austin from 1988 to 1991. A member of the Republican Party, Cooke was described by The Austin Chronicle as a \"business-booster\".\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nAfter initially attending the University of Hawaii, Cooke received a BA from Louisiana Tech University in 1966.\nCooke served as an Air Force intelligence officer during the Vietnam War and received the Bronze Star Medal. He is a former employee of the Texas Instruments from 1972 to 1983. Cooke served on Austin City Council for two terms from 1977 until 1981 leading the modern plan which revitalized downtown. Describing himself as a \"conservative businessman\", Cooke's highlights included a new convention center, expansion by Motorola (NXP), IBM and AMD, the approval of 44 miles of freeway, refocus location of the airport to the closing Bergstrom AFB site and creation of the Austin Technology Incubator during his tenure as mayor.\nHe was President/CEO of the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce from 1983 to 1987. During his tenure, a new strategy for a more diverse economy with emphasis on technology research, software development, music-film-conventions in addition to government, education and services was adopted.\n\n\n== References ==\nEdwin Leonard Waller (November 4, 1800 – January 3, 1881) was an American businessman, signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence, the first mayor of Austin, Texas, and the designer of its downtown grid plan.\n\n\n== Texas independence ==\nHe was born in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, United States, in 1800 to a family settled in the state since colonial times when they emigrated from Buckinghamshire, England. His family later settled in Missouri.\nIn April 1831, he immigrated to the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas. On July 20, he received a land grant from the government in present-day Brazoria County. He began a shipping business, transporting cotton from Velasco, Texas, to New Orleans, Louisiana, using his ship, the Sabine, and was once briefly arrested in Velasco for refusing to pay Mexican customs duty.\nHe very quickly became active in the movement for Texas independence from Mexico. On June 26, 1832, he fought and was wounded at the Battle of Velasco, an early skirmish in the Texas Revolution. In 1833, he became the alcade of Brazoria Municipality. In 1835, he represented the Columbia Municipality at the Consultation in San Felipe de Austin, where he was chosen by the members to serve in the General Council of the Provisional Government of Texas.\nOn February 1, 1836, he was elected as the Brazoria delegate to the Convention of 1836 in Washington-on-the-Brazos, where he signed the newly adopted Texas Declaration of Independence on March 2. At the convention, he served on the committee that helped draft the Constitution of the Republic of Texas.\n\n\n== 1839 Austin city plan ==\n\nIn 1839, he was chosen by Texas President Mirabeau Lamar to survey the site, sell lots, and erect public buildings for the new state capital in Austin. The original land site for the capital was narrowed to 640 acres (2.6 km2) that fronted the Colorado River between two creeks, Shoal Creek and Waller Creek, which was later named in his honor. Waller and a team of surveyors developed Austin's first city plan, commonly known as the Waller Plan, dividing the site into a fourteen-block grid plan bisected by a broad north–south thoroughfare, Congress Avenue, running up from the river to Capital Square, where the new Texas State Capitol was to be constructed. A temporary one-story capitol was erected on the corner of Colorado and 8th streets. On August 1, the first auction of 306 lots was held. The grid plan that Waller designed and surveyed now forms the basis of the streets of downtown Austin.\n\n\n== Other pursuits ==\n\nOn October 13, 1839, he offered his house for the meeting place to establish the first Masonic Lodge in Austin.\nOn January 13, 1840, he was elected the first mayor of Austin. He resigned before the end of his term, however, and moved to Austin County. A new county formed from parts of Austin County and neighboring Grimes County was renamed Waller County in his honor in 1873.\nIn 1861, Waller represented Austin County at the Texas secession convention. As one of the last living signers of the Texas Declaration of Independence, he was given the honor of signing the secession ordinance first after Convention President Oran Milo Roberts. The convention again regathered on March 4 to affirm its decision to leave the union and approve the \"Constitution of the Confederate States of America\"; although the Provisional Confederate Congress admitted Texas on March 1.\nIn 1873, Waller served as the first president of the Texas Veterans Association.\nHe died on January 3, 1881, in Austin, where he moved shortly before his death to live with one of his daughters. He was buried in Waller County, but his remains were later moved to the Texas State Cemetery in Austin.\n\n\n== External links ==\nEdwin Waller from the Handbook of Texas Online\nTexas State Cemetery: Edwin Waller\nEntry for Edwin Waller from the Biographical Encyclopedia of Texas published 1880, hosted by the Portal to Texas History.\nHistory of Austin Lodge #12\nKLRU: Austin History\nWaller Creek\nTexian I\nTom Miller Dam is a dam located on the Colorado River within the city limits of Austin, Texas, United States.

The Potter Leader-Enterprise wrote that Crosby's felony conviction may render her ineligible to hold office as mayor, because the Pennsylvania Constitution bars anyone convicted of an \"infamous crime\" from holding office in Pennsylvania. Once in office, the DA or attorney general would need to file a quo warranto to remove her. On June 7, 2022, the Austin Borough Council followed Judge Stephen Minor's court decision to remove Kate Crosby as mayor of Austin.
