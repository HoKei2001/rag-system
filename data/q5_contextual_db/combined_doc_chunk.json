        "content": "Kirk Preston Watson (born March 18, 1958) is an American attorney and politician who has served as the 59th mayor of Austin since 2023, previously holding the office as the 54th mayor from 1997 to 2001. A member of the Democratic Party, he ran unsuccessfully for Texas attorney general in the 2002 election, where he was defeated by Republican Greg Abbott, later governor of Texas. In 2006, Watson was elected to the Texas Senate from District 14.\nIn 2011, Watson was chosen by his Democratic colleagues to chair the Senate Democratic Caucus and served until 2015. On the first day of the 86th Texas Legislature, he was chosen by his colleagues—Democrats and Republicans—to serve as president pro tempore. The position typically goes to the most senior member, regardless of party, who has not yet served as president pro tem, and is second in line of succession to the Governor.\nIt was announced by the Austin American-Statesman that Watson had planned to resign from the Texas Senate to become the first dean of the University of Houston's Hobby School of Public Affairs. His resignation was effective April 30, 2020. With incumbent Mayor Steve Adler not seeking another term, Watson entered the race to become Austin mayor for a second time. He was elected for his second stint as mayor in the 2022 Austin mayoral election runoff with 50.4% of the vote.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWatson was born in Oklahoma City and raised in Saginaw, Texas, a suburb of Fort Worth, where he attended Boswell High School. He received a bachelor's degree in political science in 1980 and a Juris Doctor in 1981 from Baylor University in Waco, Texas. At Baylor Law School, Watson was editor-in-chief of the Baylor Law Review and graduated first in his class. He subsequently clerked for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n\n\n== Early political career ==\nWatson was elected president of the Texas Young Lawyers Association in 1990 and served on the executive committee of the State Bar of Texas. Watson was an active Democrat throughout the 1990s and served as the chairman of the Travis County Democratic Party.\nIn 1991, Watson was appointed by Governor Ann Richards to serve as chairman of the Texas Air Control Board, the state agency that was charged with protecting air quality in Texas.  During his tenure, he worked to merge the agency with the Texas Air Control Board and the Texas Water Commission to form the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission, and oversaw implementation of the 1991 amendments to the federal Clean Air Act.\nIn 1994, he was named the Outstanding Young Lawyer of Texas. In 1997, Watson co-founded the Austin law firm of Watson Bishop London & Galow, creating a broad law practice that represented families, doctors, small businesses, and some of the state's major universities.\n\n\n== First term as Mayor of Austin (1997–2001) ==\nIn 1997, after Watson moved from Rollingwood to Austin, he was elected as the 54th mayor of Austin, a nonpartisan position. He ran on a pledge to build consensus in a city that was then dominated by political battles between environmentalists and developers. He campaigned to raise more than $78 million for land preservation and $300 million for transportation improvements. Watson's signature accomplishments as mayor included the transformation of Downtown Austin into a \"24-hour downtown\" by encouraging development of housing and retail in place of vacant warehouses and parking lots, partially through tax incentives and the city's Smart Growth initiatives.\nIn 1999, Watson spearheaded a redevelopment project along several blocks of waterfront property in Downtown Austin, in an effort to create a new public-private \"digital district\" in place of dilapidated warehouses and businesses including the former Liberty Lunch, which were demolished. Watson, along with architect Larry Speck, courted the Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) by offering a $10.4 million tax incentive to anchor two office buildings on the site in\nThe 2024 Austin mayoral election will be held on November 5, 2024, to elect the next mayor of Austin, Texas. The election is nonpartisan; candidates' party affiliations will not appear on the ballot. Incumbent mayor Kirk Watson is running for re-election, after returning to the position of mayor following the 2022 election. \nDue to the passage of Prop D in 2021, this is the first Austin mayoral election to coincide with a presidential election.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\n\n\n=== Declared ===\nJeffery Bowen, member of the Austin Board of Adjustment\nDoug Greco, nonprofit executive and author of To Find a Killer (party affiliation: Democratic)\nCarmen Llanes Pulido, former Austin Planning Commission member (party affiliation: Democratic)\nKathie Tovo, former city councilor from the 9th district (2011–2023) (party affiliation: Democratic)\nKirk Watson, incumbent mayor (party affiliation: Democratic)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial campaign websites for mayoral candidates\nJeff Bowen for Mayor\nDave Greco (D) for Mayor\nCarmen Llanes Pulido (D) for Mayor\nKathie Tovo (D) for Mayor\nKirk Watson (D) for Mayor\nBallotpedia - Mayoral election in Austin, Texas (2024)\nThe mayor of Austin is the official head of the city of Austin in the U.S. state of Texas. The office was established in 1840 after Austin incorporated as a city in 1839. The mayor of Austin is elected to a four-year term and limited to serving no more than two terms.\nKirk Watson took office as mayor on January 6, 2023, for a second term, having served as mayor from 1997 to 2001.\n\n\n== Duties and powers ==\nAustin has a council–manager form of government which means day-to-day operations of the city are run by the city manager. The mayor is the head of city government ceremonially. The mayor is technically a member of the city council and is required to preside at all meetings. The mayor is also allowed to vote on all matters that come before the city council, but has no veto powers.\nAs of fiscal year 2022–2023, the salary for the mayor is set at $134,191.\n\n\n== Election ==\nThe mayor is elected in a citywide election. Currently, elections occur every four years during even-numbered years. Elections are non-partisan and by majority, but if no candidate receives a majority a run-off election is called between the top two candidates who received the most votes.\n\n\n== Succession ==\nPer city code of ordinances, if the mayor is absent or disabled, the Mayor Pro Tem is to act as mayor until the mayor returns or an election is held to fill the vacancy.\nThe mayor is subject to recall by registered voters if a petition is signed and filed that contains the signatures of 10 percent of the qualified voters. If the petition is verified, a recall election is called at the earliest convenient available date. If the recall passes, the mayor immediately vacates office. There are two limitations to the recall process. First, no recall petition can be filed until the mayor has been in office for at least six months. Second, the mayor will not be subject to more than one recall.\n\n\n== List of mayors of Austin ==\n\n\n== References ==\nThe 2024 United States elections were held on Tuesday, November 5, 2024. In the presidential election, former president Donald Trump was elected again and JD Vance was elected to be vice president. In addition, all 435 seats in the United States House of Representatives and 34 of the 100 seats in the United States Senate were contested to determine the membership of the 119th United States Congress. Thirteen state and territorial governorships and numerous other state and local elections were also contested. The following presidential election will be the 2028 presidential election.\n\n\n== Issues ==\n\n\n=== Economic issues ===\n\nVoters consistently cited the economy as their top issue in the 2024 election. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, a global surge in inflation ensued that raised prices on many goods, though the U.S. inflation rate had declined significantly during 2023 and 2024. The New York Times reported that both candidates \"embraced a vision of a powerful federal government, using its muscle to intervene in markets in pursuit of a stronger and more prosperous economy.\"\n\n\n=== Election interference ===\n\nDomestic Pro-Israel groups have spent large sums of money to support pro-Israel candidates against candidates critical of the Israeli government. According to a campaign finance analysis by Politico, AIPAC is the \"biggest source of Republican money flowing into competitive Democratic primaries this year.\"\nSeveral foreign nations may have interfered in the 2024 United States elections, the most notable being China, Iran, and Russia. The efforts have largely focused on propaganda and disinformation campaigns using inauthentic accounts on social media, and stoking domestic divisions and denigrating the United States and democracy more broadly.\n\n\n=== Abortion ===\nThis was the first presidential election held after the overturn of Roe v. Wade, and the third overall election cycle after the 2022 midterm elections and the 2023 off-year elections. Republican-controlled states predominantly passed near-total bans on abortion in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's June 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision. By April 2023, abortion was \"largely illegal\" in several states. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, there were 15 states that had de jure early stage bans on abortion explicitly without exceptions for rape or incest: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. (Ohio voters subsequently codified abortion rights in Ohio's state constitution via November 2023 Ohio Issue 1.) In states with laws granting exceptions, it was reported de facto that \"very few exceptions to these new abortion bans have been granted\" and that patients who had been raped or otherwise qualified for exceptions were being turned away, citing \"ambiguous laws and the threat of criminal penalties make them unwilling to test the rules\".\nDemocrats outperformed Biden's results in the 2020 U.S. presidential election in several 2022 House special elections, with abortion cited as a major contributor to their victories. Then during the 2023 elections, both Democratic and Republican operatives attributed the Democrats' overperformance streak to the growing bipartisan support of broad abortion rights in the wake of Dobbs decision. Thus, many conservative political analysts and commentators called a continued Republican alliance with the anti-abortion movement \"untenable\" and an \"electoral disaster\", and urged the party to favor abortion rights. Some issue polling has shown Donald Trump, the 2024 Presidential Republican nominee, outrunning his party and closing the gap with Democrats on the issue of abortion, but no election data with Trump directly on the ballot has happened to verify these results.\nMark Robinson, who once advocated for a complete abortion ban without exceptions, underwent a rhetorical shift in his North Carolina g\nSouth of Sanity is a 2012 British horror film directed, filmed, edited and produced by Kirk F. Watson and written and co-directed by Matthew Edwards, both of whom star in the film. The film was released on 31 October 2012 and is the first full-length fictional film to have been shot in Antarctica.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film takes place in Antarctica, centering around a rescue team that was sent to the Routledge research station to investigate a research team's lack of communication with the outside world. Once there, the team discovers no survivors in the research station but finds a diary that describes the research team's last days. The diary goes over the research team's growing malcontent and paranoia as the team is picked off one by one by a mysterious killer.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nMathew Edwards as Rob\nKirk Watson as Gaz\nMelissa Langridge as Katrina\nDaniel Edmunds as Sam\nMatt Von Tersch as Frank\nTony McLaughlan as Phil\nShaun Scopes as Joe\nRiet Van de Velde as Luke\nJames Wake as Nicolas\nJonathon Yates as Doug\nDave Routledge as Mike\nMike Shortt\nTerri Souster as Sharon\nPaul Craske as Matt\n\n\n== Development ==\nWatson began working on the film while working for the British Antarctic Survey, seeing the film as a way to pass time and \"hone his film-making\". Matt Edwards initially wrote the script as a short story, but chose to adapt it into a screenplay. Fellow staff members made up the cast and crew, with Edwards and Watson both starring in the film. The crew used a children's face painting kit for makeup and utilized food coloring and syrup for fake blood.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nJoseph Wade of Something Awful panned the film, writing, \"South of Sanity is packed to the gills with every slasher cliché in the book, and it rarely uses any of them well\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSouth of Sanity at IMDb\nThe 2022 Austin mayoral election was held on November 8, 2022, to elect the next mayor of Austin, Texas. The election was nonpartisan; candidates' party affiliations did not appear on the ballot. Incumbent mayor Steve Adler was term-limited and could not run for re-election. In the general election, state representative Celia Israel and former mayor Kirk Watson took the first two spots, leading realtor Jennifer Virden and several other candidates. Because no candidate received more than 50% of the vote, the race proceeded to a runoff election between Israel and Watson on December 13, which Watson won by 924 votes.\nDue to the passage of Proposition D in 2021, which scheduled mayoral elections in Austin to coincide with presidential elections, the winner of this election is to serve a shortened two-year term.\nThe election occurred concurrently with district city council races.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThough the election was officially nonpartisan, the runoff candidates, Celia Israel and Kirk Watson, were both affiliated with the Democratic Party. Jennifer Virden, who was third place, had a reputation of being conservative.\nSteven Pedigo, director of UT's LBJ Urban Lab, indicated that Watson's support was centralized with longtime residences of Austin in areas like the Northwest, and Israel's support was with younger demographics in growing and gentrifying areas of South and East Austin. According to Axios, Watson likely benefitted by the absence of Beto O'Rourke, who drew out younger and more progressive voters, from appearing on the runoff ballot. Furthermore, voters who supported more conservative Virden were more inclined to opt for Watson in the runoff.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\n\n\n=== Declared ===\nCraig Blanchard, business owner (party affiliation: Democratic)\nAnthony Bradshaw, security guard\nPhil Campero Brual, Legislative intern and University of Texas at Austin government student\nCelia Israel, state representative from the 50th district (party affiliation: Democratic)\nGary Spellman, business owner\nJennifer Virden, business owner and realtor\nKirk Watson, former president pro tempore of the Texas Senate from the 14th district and former mayor (party affiliation: Democratic)\n\n\n=== Withdrew ===\nErica Nix, fitness instructor, performance artist, and LGBT activist (endorsed Israel)\n\n\n=== Declined ===\nGreg Casar, city councilor (running for U.S. House)\nAdam Loewy, attorney\nKathie Tovo, city councilor\n\n\n== Endorsements ==\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== References ==\nKatharine Sarah Gallego (née Widland, born October 21, 1981) is an American politician serving as the 62nd mayor of Phoenix, Arizona, since 2019. A member of the Democratic Party, she previously served on the Phoenix City Council from 2014 to 2018.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn Katharine Sarah Widland, Gallego grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Her parents are attorneys who moved to Albuquerque from Chicago after the 1979 Chicago blizzard. She grew up with asthma, which made air quality important to her. Gallego is Jewish, celebrating her bat mitzvah in Albuquerque.\nGallego graduated from Albuquerque Academy, where she served as student body vice president. She earned a bachelor's degree in environmental science and public policy from Harvard College and a Master of Business Administration from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nGallego worked for the Arizona Democratic Party, the Arizona Office of Tourism, as well as on economic development and strategic planning for the Salt River Project.  On November 5, 2013, Gallego was elected to the Phoenix City Council for the 8th district; she was reelected in 2017. With Greg Stanton, the Mayor of Phoenix, running for the United States House of Representatives in the 2018 elections, Gallego announced she would run in a special election to succeed him. She resigned from the city council effective August 7, 2018.\n\n\n=== Elections ===\nThe city of Phoenix has nonpartisan mayoral elections. In the 2018 special election, Kate Gallego and Daniel Valenzuela advanced to a runoff in November 2018. They defeated Moses Sanchez and Nicholas Sarwark. Although the election was nonpartisan, both candidates were Democrats. Previously on the city council, they had voted similarly. Kate Gallego defeated Daniel Valenzuela in the special general runoff election for the mayor of Phoenix in 2019. She received 58.6% of votes. She assumed office on March 21, 2019. She is only the second female mayor in Phoenix history and one of the youngest big city mayors in the United States. She was backed by progressives, labor unions, the Arizona Republic editorial board, and liberal advocacy organizations. Examples of these include Emily's List, Sierra Club, and the Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona.\nIn 2020, Kate Gallego ran for re-election. In November 2020, she was returned to office with the highest number of votes ever cast in a mayoral election. Merissa Hamilton, a Libertarian write in candidate, was Gallego's closest opponent. Hamilton received 26.29% of votes. Gallego won the election receiving 60.7% of the votes. In March 2024, Gallego announced her intention to run for re-election for another term.\n\n\n=== Climate change ===\nDuring Gallego's tenure as mayor, Phoenix has taken steps to counter the urban heat island effects which are aggravated by climate change. Increasing temperatures in the Phoenix area are projected to cost billions of dollars per year. Among the steps being taken are the creation of \"cool corridors\" through the planting of desert-adapted trees, and the use of lighter-colored sidewalks and streets, particularly in areas with high pedestrian traffic and little shade. Where to plant the trees is determined in part based on \"tree equity.\" The city uses an interactive tool from the nonprofit American Forests that grades shade in neighborhoods based on satellite images. Phoenix has also opened one of the first city heat mitigation offices in the United States. It will support climate mitigation in Phoenix and share strategies with individuals and cities worldwide.\n\n\n=== Policing ===\nThe police department of Phoenix recorded shooting 44 people in 2018, spurring a reassessment from the community on police accountability. In 2020, Gallego suggested a plan for a citizens review board that would balance the police department interests and community interests. City councilman Carlos Garcia, who ran on further police accountability, created a plan\nShreya Ghoshal (born 12 March 1984), is an Indian singer.

The city was established at the confluence of the Colorado River and Shoal Creek, which was then the site of a small community known as Waterloo. The city was founded to act as the capital of the Republic of Texas and was named in honor of Stephen F. Austin, the so-called Founder of Texas. The governmental structure established by the original Austin charter called for \"one mayor, and eight Aldermen\", with the mayor being elected city-wide, and each Alderman representing one of the city's eight wards. Austin had its first mayoral election on January 13, 1840, in which citizens elected Edwin Waller to be the city's first mayor.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCouncil Meeting Information\nThis is a list of mayors of the 50 largest cities in the United States, ordered by their populations as of July 1, 2022, as estimated by the United States Census Bureau.

Austin is the southernmost state capital in the contiguous United States and is considered a Gamma + level global city as categorized by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\nAs of 2024, Austin had an estimated population of 984,567, up from 961,855 at the 2020 census. The city is the cultural and economic center of the Austin–Round Rock metropolitan statistical area, which had an estimated population of 2,473,275 as of July 1, 2023. Located in Central Texas within the greater Texas Hill Country, it is home to numerous lakes, rivers, and waterways, including Lady Bird Lake and Lake Travis on the Colorado River, Barton Springs, McKinney Falls, and Lake Walter E. Long.\nResidents of Austin are known as Austinites. They include a diverse mix of government employees, college students, musicians, high-tech workers, and blue-collar workers. The city's official slogan promotes Austin as \"The Live Music Capital of the World\", a reference to the city's many musicians and live music venues, as well as the long-running PBS TV concert series Austin City Limits. Austin is the site of South by Southwest (SXSW), an annual conglomeration of parallel film, interactive media, and music festivals. The city also adopted \"Silicon Hills\" as a nickname in the 1990s due to a rapid influx of technology and development companies. In recent years, some Austinites have adopted the unofficial slogan \"Keep Austin Weird\", which refers to the desire to protect small, unique, and local businesses from being overrun by large corporations. Since the late 19th century, Austin has also been known as the \"City of the Violet Crown\", because of the colorful glow of light across the hills just after sunset.\nEmerging from a strong economic focus on government and education, since the 1990s, Austin has become a center for technology and business. The technology roots in Austin can be traced back to the 1960s, when defense electronics contractor Tracor (now BAE Systems) began operations in the city in 1962. IBM followed in 1967, opening a facility to produce its Selectric typewriters. Texas Instruments was set up in Austin two years later, and Motorola (now NXP Semiconductors) started semiconductor chip manufacturing in 1974. A number of Fortune 500 companies have headquarters or regional offices in Austin, including 3M, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Agilent Technologies, Amazon, Apple, Dell, Facebook (Meta), General Motors, Google, IBM, Intel, NXP Semiconductors, Oracle, Tesla, and Texas Instruments. With regard to education, Austin is the home of the University of Texas at Austin, one of the largest universities in the U.S., with over 50,000 students. In 2021, Austin became home to the Austin FC, the first (and currently only) major professional sports team in the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAustin, Travis County and Williamson County have been the site of human habitation since at least 9200 BC.

He was involved in numerous lawsuits against the Barack Obama administration, seeking to invalidate the Affordable Care Act and the administration's environmental regulations.\nElected in 2014, Abbott is the first Texas governor and third governor of a U.S. state to use a wheelchair, the others being Franklin D. Roosevelt and George Wallace.

In response to the power crisis following a February 2021 winter storm, Abbott called for reforms to Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) and signed a bill requiring power plant weatherization. During the COVID-19 pandemic in Texas, Abbott opposed implementing face mask and vaccine mandates, while blocking local governments, businesses, and other organizations from implementing their own. He has also made a priority of fighting illegal immigration, starting Operation Lone Star in 2021.\n\n\n== Early life, education, and legal career ==\nAbbott was born on November 13, 1957, in Wichita Falls, Texas, of English descent.

When he was 10, he moved to Laredo with his mother and siblings, where he enrolled in 7th grade.\nGarcía enlisted in the United States Army in 1954. When García returned to Laredo, he married Marina Gonzalez in 1957. Shortly thereafter, they moved to Austin, where he enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin. He soon encountered discrimination, and was barred from fraternities.\nGarcía earned a bachelor's degree in business administration in 1959. García opened his own company, and for years, García was the only Hispanic accountant in town.\n\n\n== Public service ==\n\n\n=== Human Rights Commission ===\nIn 1967 Garcia was selected as the only Hispanic for the 21-member Human Relations Commission, (later renamed Human Rights Commission).\nThe commission's work included housing and employment discrimination, \nas well as education, police-community relations, ambulance service, and the Economy Furniture strike. Garcia investigated and helped expose discrimination at the Austin Housing Authority.\nBuilding upon this work he helped write a Fair Housing Ordinance, which was passed in 1968 by the City Council, however the Austin Board of Realtors (ABOR) soon lead a petition drive and the ordinance was repealed in a citywide vote.\nGarcia served two years on the Commission and left when his term expired in 1969.\n\n\n=== Austin School Board ===\nAfter leaving the commission, García continued to be involved in politics and the ongoing civil rights struggle. He turned his attention to the Austin school board. In 1971 the first African-American school board member, Wilhelmina R. Delco, led a failed effort to appoint García to the board to fill an unexpired term. He ran for an open seat in 1972 and won.\nThe practice of desegregation busing had begun, but the Austin school district resisted, fighting a federal discrimination order in court. The school district had been found in violation of the 1964.\nGarcía, who had three children enrolled in Austin schools, supported court-ordered busing. However a majority of the board fought the busing decree in court, including Carole Keeton Strayhorn, who was the school board president. García consistently voted against the school district's appeals of the discrimination lawsuit.\nIn 1975 García won a second term to the board and fellow board members chose him as president of the board. At the end of his second term in 1978 he left office. He ran for the State Board of Education in 1978 and 1982, losing both times to Will Davis. After his attempts to win statewide office, García turned his focus to his accounting business.\n\n\n=== City Council ===\nGarcía first ran for Austin City Council in 1991. On May 4, he won a majority of the votes and advanced to a run-off. On May 18, 1991 he beat Gilbert Martinez to secure a seat on the council. He was reelected in 1994 to Place 5 and again in 1997, to Place 2.\nOnce on the council, García closed his CPA business and focused himself on his council work, beginning with youth and housing programs. For example, he successfully helped start an anti-graffiti program that also provides family counseling to counter poverty and patterns of alienation. His efforts yielded numerous East Austin facilities, like the Cepeda Branch Library, the Zavala recreation center, Plaza Saltillo, the Mexican American Cultural Center and Tillery Square, an affordable housing development. Austin–Bergstrom International Airport was completed during his tenure on the council. When deregulation proponents proposed the city sell its public electric utility, García was key in keeping what is now Austin Energy in the public's hands. García supported the successful acquisition of significant acreage for nature preserves and parks.\nAfter being\nCabaret Voltaire were an English music group formed in Sheffield in 1973 and initially composed of Stephen Mallinder, Richard H. Kirk, and Chris Watson. Named for the Zürich nightclub that fostered the early Dada movement, the band are often characterized as among the most innovative and influential electronic acts of their era.\nThe band's early work consisted of experimentation with DIY electronics and tape recorders, as well as Dada-influenced performance art, helping to pioneer industrial music in the mid-1970s. Finding an audience during the post-punk era, they gradually incorporated more conventional elements of synthpop, dance, house and funk styles. After Watson's departure in 1981, the group continued as a two-piece until disbanding in 1994. Kirk revived the name as a solo project from 2009 until his death in 2021.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation ===\nBy the early 1970s, Chris Watson of Sheffield, England, began experimenting with electronic devices to make \"music without musical instruments.\" Inspired by Brian Eno of Roxy Music, and helped along by his work as a telephone engineer, Watson's experimentation with tape loops evolved to include custom-built kit oscillators obtained by mail order by the time he met fellow Sheffield local and Eno devotee Richard Kirk. Kirk and Watson began exploring the intersection of technology and music, producing tapes loops to generate sound collages and unusual sound structures. Kirk began to add traditional instrumentation, including clarinet and guitar. In late 1973, they brought in Kirk's friend Stephen Mallinder to provide vocals and bass guitar. Some of these early experiments were first documented on the Industrial Records cassette 1974-1976 (1980), then later on the triple album CD set Methodology '74/'78: The Attic Tapes (Mute 2002).\nThe band eventually turned to live performance, often sharing the bill with Joy Division, though much of their earliest public performance tended more towards being unconventional and provocative stunts rather than conventional shows. The trio would deploy to various parts of Sheffield with their portable tape recorders and play their experimental compositions in places as diverse as public toilets and on the streets from loudspeakers on the top of a friend's van. This raucous and punkish attitude followed the band onstage to great effect; their first live concert in May 1975 ended in a fight between the band and the audience that sent Mallinder to hospital. In another incident, Mallinder was hospitalised with a chipped backbone after objects were thrown at the band. However, the arrival of punk rock brought a more accepting audience for their industrial, electronic sound and they were championed by Sheffield punk fanzine Gunrubber edited by Paul Bower of local band 2.3.\nIn 1977, Watson financed the establishment of the band's own recording studio on the second floor of a building called the Western Works on Portobello Street in Sheffield. The \"Western Works\" studio served as the band's studio for many years as well as providing a social gathering spot for the local Sheffield scene. Western Works produced some of the earliest recordings of pioneering local bands including Clock DVA, The Human League, and New Order.\n\n\n=== Emergence: Mix-Up to Red Mecca (1979–1981) ===\nIn 1978, Cabaret Voltaire signed to Rough Trade Records. Manchester-based Factory Records had offered to sign the band, and Throbbing Gristle were also interested in signing the band to Industrial Records, but it was with an offer of a four-track Revox tape machine (in lieu of an advance) that Rough Trade secured the deal. With Rough Trade, they released several acclaimed, musically experimental singles and EPs, including Extended Play and \"Nag Nag Nag\", and albums such as Three Mantras, The Voice of America in 1980 and Red Mecca in 1981.\nIn the 27 June 1978 edition of NME, Andy Gill said \"I firmly believe Cabaret Voltaire will turn out to be one of the most important new bands to achi\nStephen Ira Adler (born March 23, 1956) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the 58th mayor of Austin from 2015 to 2023.\nAdler has been a practicing attorney in Austin in the areas of eminent domain and civil rights law for 35 years.

In the general election, state representative Celia Israel and former mayor Kirk Watson took the first two spots, leading realtor Jennifer Virden and several other candidates.

Kirk and Watson began exploring the intersection of technology and music, producing tapes loops to generate sound collages and unusual sound structures. Kirk began to add traditional instrumentation, including clarinet and guitar. In late 1973, they brought in Kirk's friend Stephen Mallinder to provide vocals and bass guitar.

The mayor of Austin is elected to a four-year term and limited to serving no more than two terms.\nKirk Watson took office as mayor on January 6, 2023, for a second term, having served as mayor from 1997 to 2001.\n\n\n== Duties and powers ==\nAustin has a council–manager form of government which means day-to-day operations of the city are run by the city manager. The mayor is the head of city government ceremonially. The mayor is technically a member of the city council and is required to preside at all meetings. The mayor is also allowed to vote on all matters that come before the city council, but has no veto powers.\nAs of fiscal year 2022–2023, the salary for the mayor is set at $134,191.\n\n\n== Election ==\nThe mayor is elected in a citywide election. Currently, elections occur every four years during even-numbered years. Elections are non-partisan and by majority, but if no candidate receives a majority a run-off election is called between the top two candidates who received the most votes.\n\n\n== Succession ==\nPer city code of ordinances, if the mayor is absent or disabled, the Mayor Pro Tem is to act as mayor until the mayor returns or an election is held to fill the vacancy.\nThe mayor is subject to recall by registered voters if a petition is signed and filed that contains the signatures of 10 percent of the qualified voters. If the petition is verified, a recall election is called at the earliest convenient available date. If the recall passes, the mayor immediately vacates office. There are two limitations to the recall process. First, no recall petition can be filed until the mayor has been in office for at least six months. Second, the mayor will not be subject to more than one recall.\n\n\n== List of mayors of Austin ==\n\n\n== References ==\nThe 2024 Austin mayoral election will be held on November 5, 2024, to elect the next mayor of Austin, Texas.

In the general election, state representative Celia Israel and former mayor Kirk Watson took the first two spots, leading realtor Jennifer Virden and several other candidates. Because no candidate received more than 50% of the vote, the race proceeded to a runoff election between Israel and Watson on December 13, which Watson won by 924 votes.\nDue to the passage of Proposition D in 2021, which scheduled mayoral elections in Austin to coincide with presidential elections, the winner of this election is to serve a shortened two-year term.\nThe election occurred concurrently with district city council races.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThough the election was officially nonpartisan, the runoff candidates, Celia Israel and Kirk Watson, were both affiliated with the Democratic Party. Jennifer Virden, who was third place, had a reputation of being conservative.\nSteven Pedigo, director of UT's LBJ Urban Lab, indicated that Watson's support was centralized with longtime residences of Austin in areas like the Northwest, and Israel's support was with younger demographics in growing and gentrifying areas of South and East Austin. According to Axios, Watson likely benefitted by the absence of Beto O'Rourke, who drew out younger and more progressive voters, from appearing on the runoff ballot.

A member of the Democratic Party, he ran unsuccessfully for Texas attorney general in the 2002 election, where he was defeated by Republican Greg Abbott, later governor of Texas. In 2006, Watson was elected to the Texas Senate from District 14.\nIn 2011, Watson was chosen by his Democratic colleagues to chair the Senate Democratic Caucus and served until 2015. On the first day of the 86th Texas Legislature, he was chosen by his colleagues—Democrats and Republicans—to serve as president pro tempore. The position typically goes to the most senior member, regardless of party, who has not yet served as president pro tem, and is second in line of succession to the Governor.\nIt was announced by the Austin American-Statesman that Watson had planned to resign from the Texas Senate to become the first dean of the University of Houston's Hobby School of Public Affairs. His resignation was effective April 30, 2020. With incumbent Mayor Steve Adler not seeking another term, Watson entered the race to become Austin mayor for a second time. He was elected for his second stint as mayor in the 2022 Austin mayoral election runoff with 50.4% of the vote.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWatson was born in Oklahoma City and raised in Saginaw, Texas, a suburb of Fort Worth, where he attended Boswell High School. He received a bachelor's degree in political science in 1980 and a Juris Doctor in 1981 from Baylor University in Waco, Texas. At Baylor Law School, Watson was editor-in-chief of the Baylor Law Review and graduated first in his class. He subsequently clerked for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n\n\n== Early political career ==\nWatson was elected president of the Texas Young Lawyers Association in 1990 and served on the executive committee of the State Bar of Texas. Watson was an active Democrat throughout the 1990s and served as the chairman of the Travis County Democratic Party.\nIn 1991, Watson was appointed by Governor Ann Richards to serve as chairman of the Texas Air Control Board, the state agency that was charged with protecting air quality in Texas.  During his tenure, he worked to merge the agency with the Texas Air Control Board and the Texas Water Commission to form the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission, and oversaw implementation of the 1991 amendments to the federal Clean Air Act.\nIn 1994, he was named the Outstanding Young Lawyer of Texas. In 1997, Watson co-founded the Austin law firm of Watson Bishop London & Galow, creating a broad law practice that represented families, doctors, small businesses, and some of the state's major universities.\n\n\n== First term as Mayor of Austin (1997–2001) ==\nIn 1997, after Watson moved from Rollingwood to Austin, he was elected as the 54th mayor of Austin, a nonpartisan position. He ran on a pledge to build consensus in a city that was then dominated by political battles between environmentalists and developers. He campaigned to raise more than $78 million for land preservation and $300 million for transportation improvements. Watson's signature accomplishments as mayor included the transformation of Downtown Austin into a \"24-hour downtown\" by encouraging development of housing and retail in place of vacant warehouses and parking lots, partially through tax incentives and the city's Smart Growth initiatives.\nIn 1999, Watson spearheaded a redevelopment project along several blocks of waterfront property in Downtown Austin, in an effort to create a new public-private \"digital district\" in place of dilapidated warehouses and businesses including the former Liberty Lunch, which were demolished. Watson, along with architect Larry Speck, courted the Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) by offering a $10.4 million tax incentive to anchor two office buildings on the site in\nThe 2018 Austin mayoral election was held on November 6, 2018, to elect the mayor of Austin, Texas. The election was a non-partisan mayoral election. If a candidate received a majority of the votes (50%+1 or greater), the candidate was elected, otherwise a runoff would be held between the top two candidates with the most votes. As incumbent Steve Adler secured a majority in the first round, a runoff was not required, and Adler was re-elected mayor for a second term.\n\n\n== Campaign ==\nAdler entered the election with a strong fundraising advantage over his challengers.\nAdler's most formidable challenger was perceived to be former Austin City Council member Laura Morrison. Morrison had been a prominent critic of CodeNEXT (a shelved effort to rewrite the city's land development code) and the deal Adler was offering to bring a Major League Soccer team to the city.\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n== References ==\nThe Austin City Council is the unicameral legislature of the city of Austin, Texas, United States of America. The mayor is included as a member of the council and presides over all council meetings and ceremonies. The current mayor of Austin is Kirk Watson. The duty of the council is to decide the city budget, taxes, and various other ordinances. While the council is officially nonpartisan, all but one current council member are affiliated with the Democratic Party.\nBefore 2012, the council was composed of six at-large elected members and the mayor, and members could only serve three terms (nine years) on the council. However, in 2012 the citizens of Austin approved two propositions that established ten single-member districts within the city and assigned council and mayoral seats staggered four-year terms, with members limited to two terms. However, the mayor remains as the 11th member on the council, an arrangement known as 10-1. The new setup was first implemented after the 2014 elections.\n\n\n== Duties ==\nThe duty of the Austin City Council is to oversee and decide on the city budget, local taxes, amendment of laws, and creation of ordinances and policies. The council members meet every Thursday. There are several boards and commissions that are composed of non-elected appointed citizens to give advice and recommendations to council members. These board generally review, debate, and comment on recommendations for the council.\n\n\n== Members ==\nMembers of the council are elected to 4 years terms and can serve a maximum of 2 terms.

The city was established at the confluence of the Colorado River and Shoal Creek, which was then the site of a small community known as Waterloo. The city was founded to act as the capital of the Republic of Texas and was named in honor of Stephen F. Austin, the so-called Founder of Texas. The governmental structure established by the original Austin charter called for \"one mayor, and eight Aldermen\", with the mayor being elected city-wide, and each Alderman representing one of the city's eight wards. Austin had its first mayoral election on January 13, 1840, in which citizens elected Edwin Waller to be the city's first mayor.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCouncil Meeting Information\nWilliam Patrick Wynn (born September 10, 1961) is an American businessman and politician, who was the mayor of Austin, Texas from 2003 to 2009.\n\n\n== Family ==\nBorn and raised in Beaumont, Texas, Wynn was the sixth of seven children.

In 2001, he was one of the founding members of, what became, Envision Central Texas. Will has also worked over the years to build support for numerous local causes and organizations.\nPrior to being elected to the Austin City Council in 2000, Wynn served as Chair of the Downtown Austin Alliance, in addition to acting as Director of the Children's Museum and Heritage Society of Austin. He has long been a leading advocate for transforming downtown Austin into the most vibrant urban core in the country.\n\n\n== Mayor of Austin ==\nAustin voters elected Wynn to be Austin's fiftieth mayor on May 3, 2003, replacing Gus Garcia. He was re-elected three years later on May 15, 2006 with over 78 percent of the vote. The front-runner from the start, Wynn garnered most of the endorsements and raised much more money than his two competitors, Council Member Danny Thomas, and Jennifer Gale. He also received a boost from the strong leadership credited to him when Hurricane Katrina evacuees came to Austin in 2005.\nAs Austin Mayor, Will Wynn served as Chairman of the Board of Directors for Austin Energy, the 9th largest public power utility in the United States. As such, Mayor Wynn presided over the nation's most successful utility-sponsored green power program (for the 4th consecutive year according to the U.S. Dep't of Energy), an award-winning energy efficiency program that has eliminated the need for a 500-megawatt, coal-burning power plant near Austin, and a greenbuilding program that was the first of its kind in the world and served as the genesis for the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and the national greenbuilding movement. Austin Energy has assets of over $3.5 billion, annual revenues of $1.2 billion, almost 1,500 employees and generates up to 3,000 megawatts of electricity. Its fuel mix is 35% natural gas, 29% coal, 23% nuclear and 11% renewables (mostly wind).\nWynn was succeeded as mayor by Lee Leffingwell, who was sworn in on June 22, 2009.\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nWill was named Austinite of the Year by Austin Under Forty (back when he was under 40); was awarded Scenic Austin's first annual Scenic Hero Award; was named Energy Executive of the Year by the Association of Energy \nAustin (  AW-stin) is the capital of the U.S. state of Texas and the seat and most populous city of Travis County, with portions extending into Hays and Williamson counties. Incorporated on December 27, 1839, it is the 26th-largest metropolitan area in the United States, the 11th-most populous city in the United States, the fourth-most populous city in the state after Houston, San Antonio, and Dallas, and the second-most populous state capital city after Phoenix, the capital of Arizona. It has been one of the fastest growing large cities in the United States since 2010. Downtown Austin and Downtown San Antonio are approximately 80 miles (129 km) apart, and both fall along the Interstate 35 corridor. This combined metropolitan region of San Antonio–Austin has approximately 5 million people. Austin is the southernmost state capital in the contiguous United States and is considered a Gamma + level global city as categorized by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\nAs of 2024, Austin had an estimated population of 984,567, up from 961,855 at the 2020 census. The city is the cultural and economic center of the Austin–Round Rock metropolitan statistical area, which had an estimated population of 2,473,275 as of July 1, 2023. Located in Central Texas within the greater Texas Hill Country, it is home to numerous lakes, rivers, and waterways, including Lady Bird Lake and Lake Travis on the Colorado River, Barton Springs, McKinney Falls, and Lake Walter E. Long.\nResidents of Austin are known as Austinites. They include a diverse mix of government employees, college students, musicians, high-tech workers, and blue-collar workers. The city's official slogan promotes Austin as \"The Live Music Capital of the World\", a reference to the city's many musicians and live music venues, as well as the long-running PBS TV concert series Austin City Limits. Austin is the site of South by Southwest (SXSW), an annual conglomeration of parallel film, interactive media, and music festivals. The city also adopted \"Silicon Hills\" as a nickname in the 1990s due to a rapid influx of technology and development companies. In recent years, some Austinites have adopted the unofficial slogan \"Keep Austin Weird\", which refers to the desire to protect small, unique, and local businesses from being overrun by large corporations. Since the late 19th century, Austin has also been known as the \"City of the Violet Crown\", because of the colorful glow of light across the hills just after sunset.\nEmerging from a strong economic focus on government and education, since the 1990s, Austin has become a center for technology and business. The technology roots in Austin can be traced back to the 1960s, when defense electronics contractor Tracor (now BAE Systems) began operations in the city in 1962. IBM followed in 1967, opening a facility to produce its Selectric typewriters. Texas Instruments was set up in Austin two years later, and Motorola (now NXP Semiconductors) started semiconductor chip manufacturing in 1974. A number of Fortune 500 companies have headquarters or regional offices in Austin, including 3M, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Agilent Technologies, Amazon, Apple, Dell, Facebook (Meta), General Motors, Google, IBM, Intel, NXP Semiconductors, Oracle, Tesla, and Texas Instruments. With regard to education, Austin is the home of the University of Texas at Austin, one of the largest universities in the U.S., with over 50,000 students. In 2021, Austin became home to the Austin FC, the first (and currently only) major professional sports team in the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAustin, Travis County and Williamson County have been the site of human habitation since at least 9200 BC. The area's earliest known inhabitants lived during the late Pleistocene (Ice Age) and are linked to the Clovis culture around 9200 BC (over 11,200 years ago), based on evidence found throughout the area and documented at the much-studied Gault Site, midway between Georgetown and Fo\nGustavo L. \"Gus\" García (January 23, 1934 – December 17, 2018) was an American politician who served as the second Hispanic mayor of Austin, Texas.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nGarcía was born in 1934 in Zapata, Texas, a poor border town, where his father ran a small grocery store. When he was 10, he moved to Laredo with his mother and siblings, where he enrolled in 7th grade.\nGarcía enlisted in the United States Army in 1954. When García returned to Laredo, he married Marina Gonzalez in 1957. Shortly thereafter, they moved to Austin, where he enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin. He soon encountered discrimination, and was barred from fraternities.\nGarcía earned a bachelor's degree in business administration in 1959. García opened his own company, and for years, García was the only Hispanic accountant in town.\n\n\n== Public service ==\n\n\n=== Human Rights Commission ===\nIn 1967 Garcia was selected as the only Hispanic for the 21-member Human Relations Commission, (later renamed Human Rights Commission).\nThe commission's work included housing and employment discrimination, \nas well as education, police-community relations, ambulance service, and the Economy Furniture strike. Garcia investigated and helped expose discrimination at the Austin Housing Authority.\nBuilding upon this work he helped write a Fair Housing Ordinance, which was passed in 1968 by the City Council, however the Austin Board of Realtors (ABOR) soon lead a petition drive and the ordinance was repealed in a citywide vote.\nGarcia served two years on the Commission and left when his term expired in 1969.\n\n\n=== Austin School Board ===\nAfter leaving the commission, García continued to be involved in politics and the ongoing civil rights struggle. He turned his attention to the Austin school board. In 1971 the first African-American school board member, Wilhelmina R. Delco, led a failed effort to appoint García to the board to fill an unexpired term. He ran for an open seat in 1972 and won.\nThe practice of desegregation busing had begun, but the Austin school district resisted, fighting a federal discrimination order in court. The school district had been found in violation of the 1964.\nGarcía, who had three children enrolled in Austin schools, supported court-ordered busing. However a majority of the board fought the busing decree in court, including Carole Keeton Strayhorn, who was the school board president. García consistently voted against the school district's appeals of the discrimination lawsuit.\nIn 1975 García won a second term to the board and fellow board members chose him as president of the board. At the end of his second term in 1978 he left office. He ran for the State Board of Education in 1978 and 1982, losing both times to Will Davis. After his attempts to win statewide office, García turned his focus to his accounting business.\n\n\n=== City Council ===\nGarcía first ran for Austin City Council in 1991. On May 4, he won a majority of the votes and advanced to a run-off. On May 18, 1991 he beat Gilbert Martinez to secure a seat on the council. He was reelected in 1994 to Place 5 and again in 1997, to Place 2.\nOnce on the council, García closed his CPA business and focused himself on his council work, beginning with youth and housing programs. For example, he successfully helped start an anti-graffiti program that also provides family counseling to counter poverty and patterns of alienation. His efforts yielded numerous East Austin facilities, like the Cepeda Branch Library, the Zavala recreation center, Plaza Saltillo, the Mexican American Cultural Center and Tillery Square, an affordable housing development. Austin–Bergstrom International Airport was completed during his tenure on the council. When deregulation proponents proposed the city sell its public electric utility, García was key in keeping what is now Austin Energy in the public's hands. García supported the successful acquisition of significant acreage for nature preserves and parks.\nAfter being\nThe 2024 Austin, Texas municipal elections will take place on Tuesday, November 5, 2024.

She lost the November general election to Perry and placed third in a six-way race, with 18 percent.\nKeeton is notable for several firsts in Austin and Texas politics. She is the first and so far only woman elected as mayor of Austin and the first Austin mayor elected to three consecutive terms. She was the first woman elected to the Texas Railroad Commission and the first woman elected as comptroller. She also was the first woman to serve as president of the Austin school board and as president of the Austin Community College board.\nIn May 2009, Keeton lost her campaign for Mayor of Austin.\n\n\n== Family ==\nKeeton was born Carole Stewart Keeton in Austin, the second child and only daughter of Madge Anna (Stewart) and W. Page Keeton, a lawyer and university dean. She attended the University of Texas at Austin, where she was a member of the Orange Jackets, a women's honorary service organization. Her father was the longtime dean of the University of Texas Law School.\nKeeton's first marriage was to attorney Barr McClellan, whom she divorced during her first term as mayor. The marriage produced four sons, Scott, Mark, Brad and Dudley McClellan. Upon her subsequent remarriage, she took the last name of her new husband, accordingly elected as comptroller under the name Carole Keeton Rylander. She married Ed Strayhorn in 2003, continuing her career as Carole Keeton Strayhorn.  She resumed her maiden name by 2014, after her third marriage ended in divorce.\n\n\n== Early political career ==\nAs Carole Keeton McClellan, she served on the board of trustees of the Austin Independent School District (which doubled as the Board of Trustees of Austin Community College) from 1972 to 1977. She served as president of both boards from 1976 to 1977. She was elected mayor of Austin in 1977 and held that post until 1983. In 1983, Governor Mark White appointed Rylander to the State Board of Insurance, where she served until resigning in 1986 to unsuccessfully challenge veteran Democratic congressman, J. J. Pickle of Austin, a longtime friend and political ally of Lyndon B. Johnson.\nAs Carole Keeton Rylander, she won election to the Texas Railroad Commission in 1994 by beating Democratic incumbent Mary Scott Nabers, an Ann W. Richards appointee, by almost 300,000 votes. The panel primarily regulates the production of oil and natural gas, and despite its name, no longer has authority over railroads. She served as commission chairman from November 1995 to January 1997, and from June 1998 to January 1999.\n\n\n== Comptroller ==\nIn 1998, Keeton entered the open race to succeed outgoing Democratic Comptroller John Sharp of Victoria, who was seeking the lieutenant governorship. Facing off against Democratic political scion Paul Hobby, the son of a former lieutenant governor, Keeton won by some 20,000 votes out of roughly 3.6 million votes cast.\nReelected in 2002, she led the statewide Republican ticket in terms of raw votes. As Carole Keeton Rylander, she drew more than one million votes more in 2002 than she had four years earlier and outpolled fellow Republican Rick Perry by some 246,000 votes even while Perry was easily dispatching Democrat Tony Sanchez of Laredo in the governor's race.\nThe tax status of Ethical Societies as religious organizations has been upheld in court cases in Washington, D.C.

The population was 482 at the 2020 census.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn September 1856, Edward Orramel Austin came to Freeman Run. He fell in love with the area and began to build a village. From then on, he lived his entire life in the valley. He served in the Civil War and returned to his valley after. His dream grew until his town, at one period, was one of the largest in Potter County. At the time of his death in 1908, the town of Austin was at its most productive with paper mills and saw mills as well. He lived to see a great dream come true. Two years later, nearly the entire town was swept away when the great dam built by the Bayless Pulp and Paper Company failed to hold back its 500,000,000+ gallons of water. The home of E.O. Austin went with it.\nThe building is a replica of E.O. Austin’s house of the 1800’s.  It is in almost the exact spot as it was before the flood of 1911.  The inside of the home is a museum filled with memorabilia from Austin and the surrounding areas (Wharton, Keating Summit and Odin). The goal of “The New, Oldest Home in Austin” is to preserve our own town’s history – past, present, and future.\n\n\n=== 1911 dam failure ===\n\nThe Austin Dam, also known as the Bayless Dam, was a concrete gravity dam for the Bayless Pulp and Paper Mill. Built in 1909, it was the largest dam of its type in Pennsylvania at the time. The catastrophic failure of the dam on September 30, 1911, destroyed much of the town and killed 78 people. The town was rebuilt, under the slogan \"the town too tough to die\". This was later changed to \"the best town by a dam site\".\n\n\n=== Mayoral controversy, 2021 ===\nOn November 9, 2021, Kate Crosby won the mayoral election against Jim Setzer. They received 38 and 30 votes, respectively. On July 7, 2021, Crosby pleaded guilty for the felony crime of aggravated assault by vehicle on December 21, 2014, which resulted in the death of one and the maiming of another man. The Potter Leader-Enterprise wrote that Crosby's felony conviction may render her ineligible to hold office as mayor, because the Pennsylvania Constitution bars anyone convicted of an \"infamous crime\" from holding office in Pennsylvania. Once in office, the DA or attorney general would need to file a quo warranto to remove her. On June 7, 2022, the Austin Borough Council followed Judge Stephen Minor's court decision to remove Kate Crosby as mayor of Austin. During a special meeting on June 30, the Austin borough council unanimously appointed James Setzer as mayor.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 4.0 square miles (10.4 km2), all land.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of the 2020 United States Census there were 482 people, 230 households in the borough.

Following his departure from the Navy, Butler earned his bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Texas at Austin in 1951. He attended the University of Texas School of Law for three years but left before earning his law degree. Instead, he entered the automobile business.\nHe met his future wife, Ann Showers, on a blind date while at the University of Texas. The couple married six months later.\nButler was described as a close friend of former U. S. President Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\n\n== Business career ==\nOutside of city politics, Butler owned and operated several prolific Austin area businesses. He opened his first car dealership at 45th and Lamar in Austin. The business grew to become the Roy Butler Lincoln-Mercury dealership. Butler owned the dealership from 1960 until 1976, during which Butler Lincoln-Mercury became the largest Lincoln dealership in Texas and Oklahoma.\nButler won the rights to the Coors Beer franchise in Central Texas in 1976, beating out approximately 2,200 other applicants. His Coors beer distributor franchise, now called Capitol Beverage, currently distributes more than forty beer brands throughout four Texas counties, as of 2009 in Caldwell, Hays, Travis, and Williamson counties.\nButler co-founded the local branch of Cellular One, which is now known as AT&T Wireless. Cellular One was the first cell phone provider in Austin. He also owned two Austin area radio stations, KVET and KASE-FM. Under Butler, KVET and KASE-FM expanded into a multi-state radio group, which Butler sold in 1999.\nFormer Austin Mayor Bruce Todd credited Butler as one of the real estate developers most responsible for transforming Downtown Austin. Butler established some of the first, and most important commercial developments in the neighborhood, which eventually attracted new residents and businesses to the area. Butler was responsible for leasing a building he owned at the corner of Sixth and Lamar to both Whole Foods Markets and the GSD&M Idea City ad agency, both of which are headquartered in Austin. With the addition of another tenant, Book People, Butler's property became an important site which attracted people to downtown Austin.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nButler served as a member of the Austin independent school District board for nine years prior to being elected to his first term as mayor in 1971.\nButler unseated Mayor Travis LaRue 65.3 to 15 percent. He was handily re-elected for a second two-year term as mayor in 1973, when he received almost 44,000 votes. This total from 1973 still holds the record for most votes ever cast for any Austin mayoral candidate in history, as of 2019.\nButler expanded and modernized the Austin Police Department. He also spearheaded efforts to build a nuclear power plant in South Texas and construct the Texas State Highway Loop 1 (MoPac Boulevard) on the west side of Austin. The two proposals brought Butler into political conflict with Austin's environmentalists, who had emerged as a force in the city during the 1960s and 1970s.\nDuring his tenure as mayor, Butler was able to recruit former United States First Lady Lady Bird Johnson to team up with his wife, Ann Butler, to establish the Town Lake Beautification Committee.

He graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in mechanical engineering. His father was an Austin firefighter and later a Travis County Deputy Sheriff and his mother worked as an admissions clerk at UT.\nPrior to serving as an elected official, Leffingwell was officer and pilot in the United States Navy and commercial airline pilot. After spending five years on active duty, including Vietnam service, Leffingwell joined the Navy Reserves, completing a total of 20 years military service. He was a pilot for Delta Air Lines for almost 32 years, ending his airline career as an international Boeing 767 and MD-11 Captain.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter retiring from Delta, Lee volunteered in Austin, working on environmental issues. He was appointed to the Environmental Board by the Austin City Council in 1999, and subsequently elected Chair by his colleagues. In 2005, he ran for city council, suffering through the death of his wife just two weeks before election day. In 2008 he won re-election for the Place 1 seat.\nLeffingwell became mayor of Austin in the 2009 election when his opponent Brewster McCracken, a distant second place contender in the initial round, voluntarily dropped out of the run-off election. He ran on a platform of increased public transparency, investment in transportation infrastructure, and support of small business. Throughout his career, Leffingwell has paid particular interest to environmental concerns, including water conservation, banning plastic grocery bags and supporting Austin environmental symbol Barton Springs.\nHe was reelected mayor in 2012. Leffingwell endorsed Steve Adler for Austin Mayor during the 2014 Mayoral election even though colleagues Mike Martinez and Sheryl Cole were running.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe 2009 Austin mayoral election was held on May 9, 2009.

This combined metropolitan region of San Antonio–Austin has approximately 5 million people.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe story of Downtown Austin began with the Republic of Texas and President Mirabeau B. Lamar in the 1830s. Lamar tapped Edwin Waller to direct the planning and construction of the new town. Waller chose a site on a bluff above the Colorado River, nestled between Shoal Creek to the west and Waller Creek to the east. Waller and a team of surveyors developed Austin's first city plan, commonly known as the Waller Plan, dividing the site into a simple grid pattern on a 640-acre (or one square-mile plot) with 14 blocks running in both directions. Much of this original design is still intact in downtown Austin today.\nOne grand avenue, which Lamar named \"Congress\", cut through the center of town from Capitol Square down to the Colorado River. The streets running north–south (paralleling Congress) were named for Texas rivers with their order of placement matching the order of rivers on the Texas state map. The east–west streets were named after trees native to the region, despite the fact that Waller had recommended using numbers (they were eventually changed to numbers in 1884). The city's perimeters stretched north to south from the river at 1st Street to 15th Street, and from East Avenue (now Interstate 35) to West Avenue.\nWaller reserved key spots for public buildings and four public squares. Three of Waller's original squares survive to this day: Wooldridge Park, Republic Square and Brush Square.\n\n\n== Downtown districts ==\n\n\n=== Congress Avenue ===\n\nEdwin Waller, the first mayor of Austin, designed Congress Avenue to be Austin's most prominent street. Planned as the widest street in the original 1839 Austin plan, the 120-foot wide Congress Avenue initially ran from the Colorado River north to the State Capitol. Not coincidentally, Congress was the most important street in Austin city life during the 19th century. Early structures along Congress Avenue included government buildings, hotels, saloons, retail stores and restaurants. By the late 1840s \"The Avenue\" formed a well-established business district. The mid-1870s introduced gaslight illumination and mule-driven streetcars as well as construction of a new Travis County courthouse at Eleventh Street.\nStretching from First Street north to Eleventh Street, the Congress Avenue Historic District was created on August 11, 1978. Stylistically, the dominating structures of significance reflected general Victorian form and detailing, tempered by local materials and building techniques. Notable structures along Congress Avenue north of the Colorado include the Texas State Capitol, Paramount Theatre, the Scarbrough and Littlefield Buildings, the Southwestern Telegraph and Telephone Building, Gethsemane Lutheran Church and the Old Bakery.\n\n\n=== Second Street District ===\nThe Second Street District is an entertainment and shopping district in Downtown Austin, just north of Lady Bird Lake and an area of great focus for development for the city, particularly between 2000–2012. Stretching six city blocks, notable buildings and complexes located within the district include Austin City Hall and Block 21, a mi\nCarlton Lee Cooke (born 1944) is an American politician and businessman who served as the 52nd mayor of Austin from 1988 to 1991. A member of the Republican Party, Cooke was described by The Austin Chronicle as a \"business-booster\".\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nAfter initially attending the University of Hawaii, Cooke received a BA from Louisiana Tech University in 1966.\nCooke served as an Air Force intelligence officer during the Vietnam War and received the Bronze Star Medal. He is a former employee of the Texas Instruments from 1972 to 1983. Cooke served on Austin City Council for two terms from 1977 until 1981 leading the modern plan which revitalized downtown. Describing himself as a \"conservative businessman\", Cooke's highlights included a new convention center, expansion by Motorola (NXP), IBM and AMD, the approval of 44 miles of freeway, refocus location of the airport to the closing Bergstrom AFB site and creation of the Austin Technology Incubator during his tenure as mayor.\nHe was President/CEO of the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce from 1983 to 1987. During his tenure, a new strategy for a more diverse economy with emphasis on technology research, software development, music-film-conventions in addition to government, education and services was adopted.\n\n\n== References ==\nEdwin Leonard Waller (November 4, 1800 – January 3, 1881) was an American businessman, signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence, the first mayor of Austin, Texas, and the designer of its downtown grid plan.\n\n\n== Texas independence ==\nHe was born in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, United States, in 1800 to a family settled in the state since colonial times when they emigrated from Buckinghamshire, England. His family later settled in Missouri.\nIn April 1831, he immigrated to the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas. On July 20, he received a land grant from the government in present-day Brazoria County. He began a shipping business, transporting cotton from Velasco, Texas, to New Orleans, Louisiana, using his ship, the Sabine, and was once briefly arrested in Velasco for refusing to pay Mexican customs duty.\nHe very quickly became active in the movement for Texas independence from Mexico. On June 26, 1832, he fought and was wounded at the Battle of Velasco, an early skirmish in the Texas Revolution. In 1833, he became the alcade of Brazoria Municipality. In 1835, he represented the Columbia Municipality at the Consultation in San Felipe de Austin, where he was chosen by the members to serve in the General Council of the Provisional Government of Texas.\nOn February 1, 1836, he was elected as the Brazoria delegate to the Convention of 1836 in Washington-on-the-Brazos, where he signed the newly adopted Texas Declaration of Independence on March 2. At the convention, he served on the committee that helped draft the Constitution of the Republic of Texas.\n\n\n== 1839 Austin city plan ==\n\nIn 1839, he was chosen by Texas President Mirabeau Lamar to survey the site, sell lots, and erect public buildings for the new state capital in Austin. The original land site for the capital was narrowed to 640 acres (2.6 km2) that fronted the Colorado River between two creeks, Shoal Creek and Waller Creek, which was later named in his honor. Waller and a team of surveyors developed Austin's first city plan, commonly known as the Waller Plan, dividing the site into a fourteen-block grid plan bisected by a broad north–south thoroughfare, Congress Avenue, running up from the river to Capital Square, where the new Texas State Capitol was to be constructed. A temporary one-story capitol was erected on the corner of Colorado and 8th streets. On August 1, the first auction of 306 lots was held. The grid plan that Waller designed and surveyed now forms the basis of the streets of downtown Austin.\n\n\n== Other pursuits ==\n\nOn October 13, 1839, he offered his house for the meeting place to establish the first Masonic Lodge in Austin.\nOn January 13, 1840, he was elected the first mayor of Austin. He resigned before the end of his term, however, and moved to Austin County. A new county formed from parts of Austin County and neighboring Grimes County was renamed Waller County in his honor in 1873.\nIn 1861, Waller represented Austin County at the Texas secession convention. As one of the last living signers of the Texas Declaration of Independence, he was given the honor of signing the secession ordinance first after Convention President Oran Milo Roberts. The convention again regathered on March 4 to affirm its decision to leave the union and approve the \"Constitution of the Confederate States of America\"; although the Provisional Confederate Congress admitted Texas on March 1.\nIn 1873, Waller served as the first president of the Texas Veterans Association.\nHe died on January 3, 1881, in Austin, where he moved shortly before his death to live with one of his daughters. He was buried in Waller County, but his remains were later moved to the Texas State Cemetery in Austin.\n\n\n== External links ==\nEdwin Waller from the Handbook of Texas Online\nTexas State Cemetery: Edwin Waller\nEntry for Edwin Waller from the Biographical Encyclopedia of Texas published 1880, hosted by the Portal to Texas History.\nHistory of Austin Lodge #12\nKLRU: Austin History\nWaller Creek\nTexian I\nTom Miller Dam is a dam located on the Colorado River within the city limits of Austin, Texas, United States.

The city was founded to act as the capital of the Republic of Texas and was named in honor of Stephen F. Austin, the so-called Founder of Texas. The governmental structure established by the original Austin charter called for \"one mayor, and eight Aldermen\", with the mayor being elected city-wide, and each Alderman representing one of the city's eight wards. Austin had its first mayoral election on January 13, 1840, in which citizens elected Edwin Waller to be the city's first mayor.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCouncil Meeting Information\nWilliam Patrick Wynn (born September 10, 1961) is an American businessman and politician, who was the mayor of Austin, Texas from 2003 to 2009."

The mid-1870s introduced gaslight illumination and mule-driven streetcars as well as construction of a new Travis County courthouse at Eleventh Street."

        "content": "Oklahoma City ( ), officially the City of Oklahoma City, and often shortened to OKC, is the capital and most populous city of the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The county seat of Oklahoma County, its population ranks 20th among United States cities and 8th in the Southern United States. The population grew following the 2010 census and reached 681,054 in the 2020 census. The Oklahoma City metropolitan area had a population of 1,396,445, and the Oklahoma City–Shawnee Combined Statistical Area had a population of 1,469,124, making it Oklahoma's largest municipality and metropolitan area by population.\nOklahoma City's city limits extend somewhat into Canadian, Cleveland, and Pottawatomie counties. However, much of those areas outside the core Oklahoma County area are suburban tracts or protected rural zones (watershed). The city is the eighth-largest in the United States by area including consolidated city-counties; it is the second-largest, after Houston, not including consolidated cities. The city is also the second-largest by area among state capital cities in the United States, after Juneau, Alaska.\nOklahoma City has one of the world's largest livestock markets. Oil, natural gas, petroleum products, and related industries are its economy's largest sector. The city is in the middle of an active oil field, and oil derricks dot the capitol grounds. The federal government employs a large number of workers at Tinker Air Force Base and the United States Department of Transportation's Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (which house offices of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Transportation Department's Enterprise Service Center, respectively).\nOklahoma City is on the I-35 and I-40 corridors, one of the primary travel corridors south into neighboring Texas and New Mexico, north towards Wichita and Kansas City, west to Albuquerque, and east towards Little Rock and Memphis. Located in the state's Frontier Country region, the city's northeast section lies in an ecological region known as the Cross Timbers. The city was founded during the Land Run of 1889 and grew to a population of over 10,000 within hours of its founding. It was the site of the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, in which 167 people died, the deadliest terror attack in U.S. history until the attacks of September 11, 2001, and the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history.\nSince weather records have been kept beginning in 1890, Oklahoma City has been struck by 14 violent tornadoes, 11 of which were rated F4 or EF4 on the Fujita and Enhanced Fujita scales, and two rated F5 and EF5.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nOklahoma City was settled on April 22, 1889, when the area known as the \"Unassigned Lands\" was opened for settlement in an event known as \"The Land Run\". On April 26 of that year, its first mayor was elected, William Couch. Some 10,000 homesteaders settled in the area that would become the capital of Oklahoma. The town grew quickly; the population doubled between 1890 and 1900. Early leaders of the development of the city included Anton H. Classen, John Wilford Shartel, Henry Overholser, Oscar Ameringer, Jack C. Walton, Angelo C. Scott, and James W. Maney.\n\nBy the time Oklahoma was admitted to the Union in 1907, Oklahoma City had surpassed Guthrie, the territorial capital, as the new state's population center and commercial hub. Soon after, the capital was moved from Guthrie to Oklahoma City. Oklahoma City was a significant stop on Route 66 during the early part of the 20th century; it was prominently mentioned in Bobby Troup's 1946 jazz song \"(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66\" made famous by artist Nat King Cole.\nBefore World War II, Oklahoma City developed significant stockyards, attracting jobs and revenue formerly in Chicago and Omaha, Nebraska. With the 1928 discovery of oil within the city limits (including under the State Capitol), Oklahoma City became a major center of oil production. Post-war growth accompanied the construction o\nThe Oklahoma City bombing was a domestic terrorist truck bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States, on April 19, 1995, the second anniversary of the end to the Waco siege. The bombing remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history.\nPerpetrated by anti-government extremists Timothy McVeigh, the mastermind, and Terry Nichols, the bombing occurred at 9:02 a.m. and killed 168 people, injured 684, and destroyed more than one-third of the building, which had to be demolished. The blast destroyed or damaged 324 other buildings and caused an estimated $652 million worth of damage. Local, state, federal, and worldwide agencies engaged in extensive rescue efforts in the wake of the bombing. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated 11 of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces, consisting of 665 rescue workers. A rescue worker was killed indirectly after being struck on the head by falling debris after the bombing.\nWithin 90 minutes of the explosion, McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma Highway Patrolman Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession. Forensic evidence quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack; Nichols was arrested, and within days, both were charged. Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices. McVeigh, a veteran of the Gulf War and a sympathizer with the U.S. militia movement, had detonated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives he parked in front of the building. Nichols had assisted with the bomb's preparation. Motivated by his dislike for the U.S. federal government and its handling of Ruby Ridge in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993, McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the fire that ended the siege in Waco. Though not confirmed to be a direct connection to the bombing, white supremacist Richard Snell, who was executed that same day, previously expressed a desire to blow up the Murrah Federal Building 12 years before the bombing took place.\nThe official FBI investigation, known as \"OKBOMB\", involved 28,000 interviews, 3,200 kg (7,100 lbs) of evidence, and nearly one billion pieces of information. When the FBI raided McVeigh's home, they found a telephone number that led them to a farm where McVeigh had purchased supplies for the bombing. The bombers were tried and convicted in 1997. McVeigh was executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001, at the U.S. federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana. Nichols was sentenced to life in prison in 2004. In response to the bombing, the U.S. Congress passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which limited access to habeas corpus in the United States, among other provisions. It also passed legislation to increase the protection around federal buildings to deter future terrorist attacks.\n\n\n== Events ==\n\n\n=== Planning ===\n\n\n==== Motive ====\n\nThe chief conspirators, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, met in 1988 at Fort Benning during basic training for the U.S. Army. McVeigh met Michael Fortier as his Army roommate. The three shared interests in survivalism. McVeigh and Nichols were radicalized by white supremacist and antigovernment propaganda. They expressed anger at the federal government's handling of the 1992 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) standoff with Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge, as well as the Waco siege, a 51-day standoff in 1993 between the FBI and Branch Davidian members that began with a botched Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) attempt to execute a search warrant. There was a firefight and ultimately a siege of the compound, resulting in the burning and shooting deaths of David Koresh and 75 others. In March 1993, McVeigh visited the Waco site during the standoff, and again after the siege ended. He later decided to bomb a federal building as a response to the raids and to protest what he believed to be U.S. government efforts to restrict rights o\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder are an American professional basketball team based in Oklahoma City. The Thunder compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Northwest Division of the Western Conference. The team plays its home games at Paycom Center.\nThe Thunder's NBA G League affiliate is the Oklahoma City Blue, which it owns. The Thunder are the only team in the major professional North American sports leagues based in the state of Oklahoma. Oklahoma City previously hosted the New Orleans Hornets for two seasons following devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.\nThe team was originally established as the Seattle SuperSonics, an expansion team that joined the NBA for the 1967–68 season. The SuperSonics relocated from Seattle to Oklahoma City on July 3, 2008, after a settlement was reached between the ownership group led by Clay Bennett and lawmakers in Seattle following a lawsuit. In Seattle, the SuperSonics qualified for the NBA playoffs 22 times, won their division six times, advanced to three NBA Finals, and won the 1979 NBA Championship.\nIn Oklahoma City, the Thunder qualified for their first playoff berth during the 2009–10 season. They won their first division title as the Thunder in the 2010–11 season and their first Western Conference championship as the Thunder in the 2011–12 season, appearing in the NBA Finals for the fourth time in franchise history and first time since 1996, when the team was based in Seattle.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1967–2008: Seattle SuperSonics ===\n\nThe Thunder's previous incarnation, the Seattle SuperSonics were formed in 1967. In their 41 seasons in Seattle, the SuperSonics compiled a 1,745–1,585 (.524) win–loss record in the regular season and went 107–110 (.493) in the playoffs. The franchise's titles include three Western Conference championships (1978, 1979 and 1996) and one NBA title in 1979. In their last season, they drafted franchise player Kevin Durant, setting up the Thunder for success.\n\n\n=== 2008-2016: Durant and Westbrook era ===\n\n\n==== 2008–2009: Move to Oklahoma City and inaugural season ====\n\nIn 2006, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz sold the SuperSonics and its Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) sister franchise, the Seattle Storm, for $350 million to the Professional Basketball Club LLC, a group of Oklahoma City investors led by Clay Bennett. The sale of the SuperSonics and Storm was approved by NBA owners the following October. In 2007, Bennett announced that the franchise would move to Oklahoma City as soon as the lease with KeyArena expired.\n\nIn June 2008, a lawsuit brought by the city of Seattle against Bennett due to his attempts to break the final two years of the Sonics' lease at KeyArena went to federal court. Nearly a month later, the two sides reached a settlement agreement. The terms awarded the city $45 million to get out of the remaining lease at KeyArena, and would have provided an additional $30 million payment to Seattle in 2013 if certain conditions had been met. The owners agreed to leave the SuperSonics name, logo, colors, banners, trophies, and records in Seattle for a possible future NBA franchise; however, the items would remain the property of the Oklahoma City team along with other \"assets\", including championship banners and trophies. On September 3, 2008, the team name, logo and colors for the Oklahoma City franchise were revealed to the public. The name \"Thunder\" was chosen in reference to Oklahoma's location in Tornado Alley and Oklahoma City as the home of the U.S. Army's 45th Infantry Division, the Thunderbirds. The SuperSonics' final NBA draft was in 2008, and they used the fourth overall pick to select Russell Westbrook, a young point guard from UCLA, who would become the team's franchise player.\nThe Thunder participated in the Orlando Pro Summer League featuring their second-year players, potential free agents and rookies. The players wore generic black and white jerseys reading \"OKC-NBA\" agai\nThe Oklahoma City Comets are a Minor League Baseball team of the Pacific Coast League (PCL) and the Triple-A affiliate of the Los Angeles Dodgers. They are located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and play their home games at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark, which opened in 1998 in the city's Bricktown district.\nThe team was originally known as the Oklahoma City 89ers from 1962 to 1997 and played at All Sports Stadium. The 89ers competed in the Triple-A American Association (AA) in 1962, moved to the Pacific Coast League from 1963 to 1968, and returned to the AA from 1969 to 1997. After the American Association disbanded, the 89ers rejoined the PCL in 1998 and have been members of it since, including the 2021 season when it was known as the Triple-A West. The team renamed itself the Oklahoma RedHawks from 1998 to 2008 and the Oklahoma City RedHawks from 2009 to 2014. The franchise affiliated with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2015 and changed its name to the Oklahoma City Dodgers. The team was temporarily called the Oklahoma City Baseball Club for the 2024 season before becoming the Comets in 2025.\nOklahoma City has won five league championships. The 89ers won the PCL championship in 1963 and 1965 as the Triple-A affiliate of the Houston Colt .45s/Astros. They later won the American Association championship in 1992 and 1996 with the Texas Rangers. Oklahoma City won their third PCL championship in 2023 as affiliates of the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\n\n== Oklahoma City Mets and Indians (1904–1957) ==\nOklahoma City has been home to professional baseball for all but a few years since 1904, when the Metropolitans (Mets) were established as the city's first team. Oklahoma City's teams and names have changed numerous times since. The team became known as the Indians in 1909 before returning to the original Mets name in 1910 and reverting again to the Indians name in 1911. Oklahoma City was home to the Senators in 1912. After one year without a baseball team, Oklahoma City's squad became the Boosters in 1914. The Senators name returned from 1915 to 1916, but the Boosters name came back in 1917. The Oklahoma City Indians name returned in 1918 and the team name stuck until 1957 (the team did not compete during World War II).\n\n\n== Oklahoma City 89ers (1962–1997) ==\nOklahoma City's current baseball franchise began competing in 1962 as the Oklahoma City 89ers following a four-year period without professional baseball in the area. The franchise's original name made reference to the Land Run of 1889, which led to the founding of Oklahoma City. \n\nAfter the Houston Buffaloes of the American Association were purchased for territorial rights by the Houston Colt .45s (later the Houston Astros) of the National League, the big league club decided to move the Buffs elsewhere. In July 1961, Spec Richardson, who was then general manager of the Buffs, met with Oklahoma City officials and boosters, and agreed to move the team. After a unanimous approval from the American Association's board of directors, the current franchise began play in 1962 as the top affiliate of the Houston Colt .45s. The 89ers won the PCL championship in 1963 and 1965. \nThe Astros divested the team to Tulsa businessman, P. C. Dixon, in November 1970. The franchise affiliated with Cleveland from 1973 and 1975 and with the Philadelphia Phillies from 1976 until 1982. \nThe Texas Rangers became the parent club in 1983. The 89ers won the American Association championship in 1992 and 1996 as an affiliate of the Rangers.\n\n\n== Oklahoma City RedHawks (1998–2014) ==\n The franchise moved to the new Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark in 1998, returned to the PCL, and renamed the team the Oklahoma RedHawks. The team was renamed the RedHawks after the red-tailed hawk, a bird of prey commonly seen throughout Oklahoma. When announcing the new name, team officials noted the raptor's four-foot wingspan and migration patterns, which always return the bird to Oklahoma. A hawk is also part of the state's official song.\n Pri\nThe Oklahoma City Blue are an American professional basketball team based in Oklahoma City and are affiliated with the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Blue compete in the NBA G League as members of the Western Conference. The Blue play their home games at Paycom Center, an arena shared with the Thunder. \nThe franchise began as the Asheville Altitude in 2001 playing in Asheville, North Carolina for four seasons. They won the 2004 and 2005 NBDL championship, becoming the first (and so far only) team to win consecutive league championships. After struggling with poor attendance, the franchise relocated to Tulsa, Oklahoma and played nine seasons as the Tulsa 66ers. Before the 2014–15 season, the franchise relocated again to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, becoming the Oklahoma City Blue. One of three teams still playing from the first league season, they are the oldest surviving NBA G League champion to play in the league.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Asheville Altitude (2001–2005) ===\nThe franchise began in 2001 when NBA Commissioner David Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik formed the National Basketball Development League. Asheville, North Carolina was chosen to one of the first eight franchises located in the southeastern United States. The franchise hired Joey Meyer and began their inaugural season in the 2001–02 season.\nIn its inaugural season, the Altitude had a 26–30 record, finishing sixth in the league. Center Paul Grant was named to the league's inaugural All-NBDL Second Team. After accumulating a 49–57 record after two seasons, the Altitude won back-to-back championships in its final two seasons in Asheville. Despite the Altitude's recent success, the franchise experienced poor attendance with fans often numbering in the dozens despite a 5,000 seat capacity. In its first four seasons, the Altitude averaged 788 fans a game and suffered at least $100,000 in losses.\nAfter the 2004–05 season, team president Rudy Bourg announced the Altitude had been sold to an independent ownership group and would relocate prior to the start of next season.\n\n\n=== Tulsa 66ers (2005–2014) ===\nBefore the start of the 2005–06 season, the league announced expansion to the southwest United States with Tulsa, Oklahoma being chosen as a host city. Initially planned to being independently owned and operated by the league, Southwest Basketball, LLC, operated by owner David Kahn, purchased the Altitude and relocated the franchise to Tulsa. The franchise also rebranded and was renamed to the Tulsa 66ers, in honor of the U.S. Route 66 which runs through the city and the state of Oklahoma. Starting in 2005, the National Basketball Association announced an affiliation and assignment system for the league. Under the system, the 66ers were directly affiliated with the Chicago Bulls, Indiana Pacers, Milwaukee Bucks and the New Orleans Hornets. Prior to the start of the 2006–07 season, the franchise's affiliation with the Bulls and Pacers ended with the addition of the New York Knicks. Before the relocation of the Oklahoma City Thunder, the franchise had its final affiliations with the Bucks, Knicks, and the Dallas Mavericks during the 2007–08 season.\nOn August 1, 2008, the newly relocated Oklahoma City Thunder agreed to purchase the 66ers for $2.25 million, becoming only the third NBA franchise to own a D-League team. In the agreement, the Thunder owned full control of the team's business and basketball operations and became the sole affiliate of the Thunder.\n\n\n=== Oklahoma City Blue (2014–present) ===\nAfter getting offers from four venues, Professional Basketball Club felt none were suitable and announced the 66ers would move to Oklahoma City and play in the Cox Convention Center across the street from the Chesapeake Energy Arena where the parent club Oklahoma City Thunder plays starting with the 2014–15 season. The team's front offices are located in the Chesapeake Energy Arena along with the rest of the front office staff of the parent club Oklahoma City Thunder. Wit\nOklahoma (  OHK-lə-HOH-mə; Choctaw: Oklahumma, pronounced [oklahómma]) is a state in the South Central region of the United States. It borders Texas to the south and west, Kansas to the north, Missouri to the northeast, Arkansas to the east, New Mexico to the west, and Colorado to the northwest. Partially in the western extreme of the Upland South, it is the 20th-most extensive and the 28th-most populous of the 50 United States. Its residents are known as Oklahomans and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City.\nThe state's name is derived from the Choctaw words okla, 'people' and humma, which translates as 'red'.  Oklahoma is also known informally by its nickname, \"The Sooner State\", in reference to the Sooners, American settlers who staked their claims in formerly American Indian-owned lands until the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889 authorized the Land Rush of 1889 opening the land to settlement.\nWith ancient mountain ranges, prairie, mesas, and eastern forests, most of Oklahoma lies in the Great Plains, Cross Timbers, and the U.S. Interior Highlands, all regions prone to severe weather. Oklahoma is at a confluence of three major American cultural regions. Historically, it served as a government-sanctioned territory for American Indians moved from east of the Mississippi River, a route for cattle drives from Texas and related regions, and a destination for Southern settlers. There are currently 26 Indigenous languages spoken in Oklahoma. According to the 2020 U.S. census, 14.2 percent of Oklahomans identify as American Indians, the highest indigenous population by percentage in any state.\nA major producer of natural gas, oil, and agricultural products, Oklahoma relies on an economic base of aviation, energy, telecommunications, and biotechnology. Oklahoma City and Tulsa serve as Oklahoma's primary economic anchors, with nearly two-thirds of Oklahomans living within their metropolitan statistical areas.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name Oklahoma comes from the Choctaw language phrase okla, 'people', and humma, translated as 'red'. Choctaw Nation Chief Allen Wright suggested the name in 1866 during treaty negotiations with the federal US government on the use of Indian Territory. He envisioned an all exclusive American Indian state controlled by the United States bureau of Indian Affairs. Oklahoma later became the de facto name for Oklahoma Territory, and it was officially approved in 1890, two years after that area was opened to American settlers.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Columbian ===\nIndigenous peoples were present in what is now Oklahoma by the last ice age. Ancestors of the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes (including Teyas and Escanjaques and Tawakoni), Tonkawa, and Caddo (including Kichai) lived in what is now Oklahoma. Southern Plains villagers lived in the central and west of the state, with a subgroup, the Panhandle culture people, living in the panhandle region. Caddoan Mississippian culture peoples lived in the eastern part of the state. Spiro Mounds, in what is now Spiro, Oklahoma, was a major Mississippian mound complex that flourished between AD 850 and 1450. Plains Apache people settled in the Southern Plains and in Oklahoma between 1300 and 1500.\n\n\n=== European exploration and colonization ===\nThe expedition of Spaniard Francisco Vázquez de Coronado traveled through the state in 1541, but French explorers claimed the area in the early 18th century. By the 18th century, Comanche and Kiowa entered the region from the west and Quapaw and Osage peoples moved into what is now eastern Oklahoma. French colonists claimed the region until 1803, when all the French territory west of the Mississippi River was acquired by the United States in the Louisiana Purchase. The territory was a part of the Arkansas Territory from 1819 until 1828.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nDuring the 19th century, the U.S. federal government forcibly removed tens of thousands of American Indians from their ancestral homelands from across North America and\nThe Oklahoma City metropolitan area is an urban region in Central Oklahoma. It is the largest metropolitan area in the state of Oklahoma and contains the state capital and principal city, Oklahoma City. It is often known as the Oklahoma City Metro (sometimes shortened to simply \"the Metro\"), Oklahoma City Metroplex, or Greater Oklahoma City in addition to the nicknames Oklahoma City itself is known for, such as OKC or \"the 405\".\nCounties in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area include Canadian, Cleveland, Grady, Lincoln, Logan, McClain, and Oklahoma. According to the 2020 U.S. census, the metropolitan region had a population of 1,425,695, up from 1,083,346 at the 2000 census.\nThe Micropolitan Statistical Area of Shawnee (in Pottawatomie County) is included in Oklahoma City's Combined Statistical Area (CSA) which brings the area population to 1,498,693.\n\n\n== Principal communities ==\nPrincipal cities\n\nOklahoma City\nShawnee\nSecondary cities\n\nNorman\nEdmond\nSuburbs\n\nExurbs\n\nStillwater\nKingfisher\nCounties\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe Oklahoma City metropolitan area, being the state's principal and largest metropolitan statistical area, had a population of 1,425,695 at the 2020 census, up from 1,252,987 in 2010; the 2021 American Community Survey estimated its population increased to 1,441,647. With a 2021 median age of 36.1, the sex ratio was 51% female and 49% male.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau in 2010, its racial and ethnic makeup was 67.4% non-Hispanic white, 10.4% African American, 4.1% Native American, 2.8% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 5.5% from other races or ethnicities, 5.2% multiracial, and 11.3% Hispanic or Latino of any race. During the 2021 American Community Survey, its racial and ethnic makeup was 62% white, 10% African American, 3% Native American, 3% Asian, 1% other, 8% multiracial, and 14% Hispanic or Latino of any race.\nIn 2021, there were an estimated 565,309 households with an average of 2.5 persons per household; among them, 61% were married-couples and 18% were non-family households. Approximately 51% of its population was married. Of its 615,726 housing units at the census estimates, 92% were occupied and 64% were owner-occupied. An estimated 32% of its housing units were constructed since 2017, reflecting the metropolitan population growth. There was a median owner-occupied value of $190,800 and 36% of its units ranged from $100–200,000, while 17% were valued at under $100,000.\nAs of 2016, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated the median household income in the MSA was $55,065, and the median family income was $68,797. The per capita income for the MSA in 2015 was $27,316. For the population age 25 years and over, 88.4% was a high school graduate for higher, and 29.8% had a bachelor's degree or higher. By the 2021 ACS census estimates, its median household income increased to $61,815; 40% of the population made under $50,000 while 32% made from $50–100,000 annually. The metropolis had a per capita income of $32,703. Among the population economically, 14.5% of its population lived at or below the poverty line. According to Forbes, its cost of living was 6% below the national average.\nReligiously and spiritually, the Association of Religion Data Archives in 2020 reported that the Southern Baptist Convention was the metropolitan area's largest Christian tradition with 213,008 members, Christianity being the area's predominant religion. Non/interdenominational Protestants were the second largest tradition with 195,158 members. The Roman Catholic Church claimed 142,491 adherents throughout the metropolitan region and Pentecostals within the Assemblies of God USA numbered 48,470. The remainder of Christians in the area held to predominantly Evangelical Christian beliefs in numerous evangelical Protestant denominations. Outside of Christendom, there were 4,230 practitioners of Hinduism and 2,078 Mahayana Buddhists. An estimated 8,904 residents practiced Islam during this study, making it the second-largest religion i\nElohim City (also known as Elohim City Inc. and Elohim Village) is a private community in Adair County, Oklahoma, United States. The 400 acres (1.6 km2) rural retreat was founded in 1973 by Robert G. Millar, a Canadian immigrant, former Mennonite, and \"one of the most important leaders\" in America's Christian Identity movement, a theology common to an assortment of right-wing extremist groups. The community gained national attention for its ties to members of The Order in the 1980s, as well as with convicted Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh in the 1990s.\nThe enclave consists of approximately one dozen structures, some of them mobile homes and others modernistic dome houses. The center of activity is the church-community center, where residents meet for hour-long sessions each morning.\nRobert G. Millar died on May 28, 2001. After his death, his second-oldest son, John Millar, became the leader of Elohim City. John Millar died on February 28, 2019.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nRobert G. Millar emigrated in the 1950s from Kitchener, Ontario to Oklahoma City, where he established a church. In the mid-1960s, Millar moved to Maryland, where he ran an evangelical camp near Ellicott City. This camp was located in Howard County on Frederick Road about one mile (1.6 km) west of US Route 29, at the former location of St. Charles College, a Catholic minor seminary destroyed by fire in 1911.\nIn 1973, Millar returned to Oklahoma with around 18 followers, some of whom were related to him by birth or marriage, to found Elohim City.\n\n\n=== Criminal events ===\nIn 1986, a Canadian woman and her children sought refuge in the city, contravening a court order awarding custody of the children to her husband. Officers attempting to arrest the woman were met by an armed man.\nBy the mid-1990s, four members of the Aryan Republican Army (Michael William Brescia, Kevin McCarthy, Scott Stedeford, and Mark Thomas) were residents of Elohim City. Brescia was engaged to Millar's step-granddaughter and stayed in the city for almost two years. Between 1994 and 1995, these four, together with other members of the ARA (known by the media as the Midwest Bank Robbers), were responsible for a series of 22 bank robberies totaling over $250,000 in the American Midwest, which they used to finance white supremacist causes. Millar denied any knowledge of the robberies. \nIt is believed that the ARA may have also recruited members at Elohim City and/or may have sent recruits to Elohim City for \"re-education.\" Reports also indicate that Elohim City may have provided ARA with training grounds and assisted them in distributing monies received from other groups.\nThe Mueller family, who were brief residents of Elohim City, reportedly left the compound in fear they would be assassinated by the ARA. The Muellers were supposedly privy to information connecting the ARA to the Oklahoma City bombing. Soon after, the Mueller family were tortured and assassinated by Chevie Kehoe and Daniel Lewis Lee under the direction of the ARA.\nThe remains of former Elohim City guest Richard Snell were released to Elohim City residents following his April 19, 1995 execution in Arkansas. Snell taunted jailers that something drastic would happen on the day of his execution. The Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was destroyed by explosives in the hours before he died. Earlier criminal proceedings had produced evidence that Snell and other affiliates visited the Murrah Building in 1983 to examine it as a possible bombing target. \nHowever, when Snell watched televised reports of the Oklahoma City bombing prior to his execution, according to Millar, who was with Snell at the time, Snell was appalled by what he saw. This contrasts with reports that he was seen nodding in agreement while watching the broadcast. McVeigh is known to have telephoned Elohim City two weeks before the bombing of the Murrah building.\nIn 2008 an Adair County man, who had been evicted from Elohim City, was charged with threatening to commit v\nOklahoma City is home to several professional sports teams, including the Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Thunder is the city's second \"permanent\" major professional sports franchise after the now-defunct AFL Oklahoma Wranglers and is the third major-league team to call the city home when considering the temporary hosting of the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets for the 2005–06 and 2006–07 NBA seasons.\nOther notable professional sports clubs in Oklahoma City include the Oklahoma City Comets, which is the Triple-A affiliate of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and the Crusaders of Oklahoma Rugby Football Club USA Rugby\n\n\n== Venues ==\n \nPaycom Center in downtown Oklahoma City is the large multipurpose arena which hosts concerts, NHL exhibition games, and many of the city's pro sports teams. In 2008, the Oklahoma City Thunder became the major tenant. Located nearby in Bricktown, the Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark is the home to the city's baseball team, the Comets. \"The Brick\", as it is locally known, is considered one of the finest minor league parks in the nation.\nThere are several other stadiums and arenas in the city, including the arena inside the Cox Convention Center (where Blue home games are held), the State Fair Arena (which will be demolished September 2022), Taft Stadium, USA Softball Hall of Fame Stadium, and Abe Lemons Arena which is located at Oklahoma City University.\nMacArthur Park Raceway is an internationally recognized raceway in Oklahoma City.\n\n\n== Basketball ==\n\n\n=== Hornets ===\n\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Louisiana, and surrounding areas, the NBA's New Orleans Hornets (now the New Orleans Pelicans) temporarily relocated to the venue then known as Ford Center, playing the majority of its home games there during the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons. The team became the first NBA franchise to play regular-season games in the state of Oklahoma.\nThe team was known as the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets while playing in Oklahoma City and had adopted a split personality of sorts, wearing 'KC neutral' home jerseys (with an KC patch of sorts over an H-alternate jersey) and 'New Orleans' jerseys during away games.\nAlthough some city officials wanted the Hornets to stay in Oklahoma City permanently, the team ultimately returned to New Orleans full-time for the 2007–08 season. The Hornets played their final home game in Oklahoma City during the exhibition season on October 9, 2007, against the Houston Rockets, as a way to say thanks for the temporary hosting. The 'hometown Hornets' won the game 94–92.\n\n\n=== Thunder ===\n\nOn July 2, 2008, the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s Seattle SuperSonics franchise announced the team would relocate to Oklahoma City, and begin play at the city's sports arena (then known as the Ford Center) starting with the 2008–09 NBA season. On July 2, the city of Seattle settled with the ownership group of the SuperSonics franchise, allowing them to move the team immediately. As part of the settlement, the SuperSonics name, logos, and colors were left in Seattle for any use by a future expansion or relocated team in Seattle. The franchise history would be shared between the hypothetical team and the Thunder. The relocated team was named the Oklahoma City Thunder and color scheme for the Oklahoma City Thunder was announced on September 3. Other name finalists for the relocated team included \"Energy\", \"Wind\", \"Marshalls\", \"Barons\", and \"Bison\".\nWith a 28–2 vote by its Board of Governors, on April 18, 2008, the NBA had provided conditional approval for the franchise to move to Oklahoma City for the 2008–09 season provided the ownership could free themselves from the legal challenges that existed with the city of Seattle. On July 2, 2008, the city of Seattle reached an agreement to terminate the Sonics' lease and allow the team to relocate to Oklahoma City. Clay Bennett determined that as of July 3, 2008 the relocation of the now-defunct Sea\nTulsa ( TUL-sə) is the second-most-populous city in the state of Oklahoma, after Oklahoma City, and the 48th-most-populous city in the United States. The population was 413,066 as of the 2020 census. It is the principal municipality of the Tulsa metropolitan area, a region with 1,034,123 residents. The city serves as the county seat of Tulsa County, the most densely populated county in Oklahoma, with urban development extending into Osage, Rogers and Wagoner counties.\nTulsa was settled between 1828 and 1836 by the Lochapoka Band of Creek Native American tribe and most of Tulsa is still part of the territory of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation.\nHistorically, a robust energy sector fueled Tulsa's economy; however, today the city has diversified and leading sectors include finance, aviation, telecommunications and technology. Two institutions of higher education within the city have sports teams at the NCAA Division I level: the University of Tulsa and Oral Roberts University. As well, the University of Oklahoma has a secondary campus at the Tulsa Schusterman Center, and Oklahoma State University has a secondary campus located in downtown Tulsa. For most of the 20th century, the city held the nickname \"Oil Capital of the World\" and played a major role as one of the most important hubs for the American oil industry.\nIt is situated on the Arkansas River between the Osage Hills and the foothills of the Ozark Mountains in northeast Oklahoma, a region of the state known as \"Green Country\". Considered the cultural and arts center of Oklahoma, Tulsa houses two art museums, full-time professional opera and ballet companies, and one of the nation's largest concentrations of art deco architecture.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe area where Tulsa now exists is considered Indian Territory, on the land of the Kiikaapoi (Kickapoo), Wahzhazhe Ma zha (Osage), Muscogee (Creek), and Caddo tribes, among others, before it was first formally settled by the Muscogee (Creek) Nation in 1836. They established a small settlement under the Creek Council Oak Tree at the present-day intersection of Cheyenne Avenue and 18th Street. They named their new settlement Tallasi, meaning \"old town\" in Creek, which later became \"Tulsa\". The area around Tulsa was also settled by members of the other so-called \"Five Civilized Tribes\" who had been relocated to Oklahoma from the Southern United States. Most of modern Tulsa is located in the Creek Nation, with parts located in the Cherokee and Osage Nations.\nAlthough Oklahoma was not yet a state during the Civil War, the Tulsa area saw its share of fighting. The Battle of Chusto-Talasah took place on the north side of Tulsa and several battles and skirmishes took place in nearby counties. After the War, the tribes signed Reconstruction treaties with the federal government that in some cases required substantial land concessions. In the years after the Civil War and around the turn of the century, the area along the Arkansas River that is now Tulsa was periodically home to or visited by a series of colorful outlaws, including the legendary Wild Bunch, the Dalton Gang, and Little Britches.\n\n\n=== Incorporation and \"Oil Capital\" prosperity ===\nAround August 1, 1882, the town was almost centered at a location just north of the current Whittier Square, when a construction crew laying out the line of the St. Louis-San Francisco Railroad chose that spot for a sidetrack.  However, an area merchant persuaded them to move the site further west into the Muscogee Nation, which had friendlier laws for white business owners.  On January 18, 1898, Tulsa was officially incorporated and elected Edward E. Calkins as the city's first mayor.\nTulsa was still a micro town near the banks of the Arkansas River in 1901 when its first oil well, named Sue Bland No. 1, was established. Much of the oil was discovered on land whose mineral rights were owned by members of the Osage Nation under a system of headrights. By 1905, the discovery of the grand Glenn Pool Oil R\nThe Oklahoma City National Memorial is a memorial site in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States, that honors the victims, survivors, rescuers, and all who were affected by the Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995. It is situated on the former site of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, which was destroyed in the bombing.  The building was located on NW 5th Street between N. Robinson Avenue and N. Harvey Avenue.\nThe national memorial was authorized on October 9, 1997, by President Bill Clinton's signing of the Oklahoma City National Memorial Act of 1997. It was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places the same day. The memorial is administered by Oklahoma City National Memorial Foundation, with National Park Service staff to help interpret the memorial for visitors.\nThe memorial was formally dedicated on April 19, 2000, the fifth anniversary of the bombing.  The museum was dedicated and opened 10 months later on February 19, 2001.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nOn April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh parked a Ryder rental truck filled with explosives in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. The resulting explosion killed 168 people and destroyed the entire north face of the building.\nMonths after the attack, Mayor Ron Norick appointed a task force to look into the creation of a permanent memorial where the Murrah building once stood. The Task Force called for 'a symbolic outdoor memorial', a Memorial Museum, and for the creation of the Oklahoma City National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism. Six hundred and twenty four designs were submitted for the memorial and in July 1997 a design by Butzer Design Partnership, which consists of husband and wife Hans and Torrey Butzer, was chosen.\nIn October 1997, President Bill Clinton signed law creating the Oklahoma City National Memorial to be operated by the Oklahoma City National Memorial Trust. The total cost of the memorial was $29.1 million ($55,140,783.18 in 2023): $10 million for the Outdoor Symbolic Memorial, $7 million for the Memorial Museum, $5 million for the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism and the rest for other costs. The federal government appropriated $5 million for construction with the state of Oklahoma matching that amount. More than $17 million in private donations was raised.\nOn April 19, 2000, the fifth anniversary of the attack, the Outdoor Symbolic Memorial was dedicated. On February 19, 2001, the Memorial Museum was dedicated. In 2004 it was transferred from the trust, to the Oklahoma City National Memorial Foundation, designating it an affiliated area of the National Park System. The Oklahoma City National Memorial since its opening has seen over 4.4 million visitors to the Outdoor Symbolic Memorial and 1.6 million visitors to the Memorial Museum. The Memorial has an average of 350,000 visitors per year.\n\n\n== Memorial features ==\n\nThe Outdoor Symbolic Memorial consists of the following segments on 3.3 acres (13,000 m2) and is accessible day or night.\n\nThe Gates of Time: monumental twin bronze gates frame the moment of destruction – 9:02 – and mark the formal entrances to the Outdoor Memorial. 9:01, found on the eastern gate, represents the last moments of peace, while its opposite on the western gate, 9:03, represents the first moments of recovery. Both time stamps are inscribed on the interior of the monument, facing each other and the Reflecting Pool.\nThe outside of each gate bears this inscription:\n\nReflecting Pool: a thin layer of water flows over polished black granite to form the pool, which runs east to west down the center of the Memorial (also see reflecting pool) on what was once Fifth Street.  Although the pool is flowing, visitors are able to see a mirror image of themselves in the water. Visitors seeing their reflections are said to be seeing \"someone changed forever by what happened here.\"\nField of Empty Chairs: one hundred and sixty-eight empty chairs hand-crafted from glass, bronze, and\nBoise City ( BOYSS) is a city in and the county seat of Cimarron County, in the Panhandle of Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,166 at the 2020 census, a decline of 7.9 percent from 1,266 in 2010.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBoise City was founded in 1908 by developers J. E. Stanley, A. J. Kline, and W. T. Douglas (all doing business as the Southwestern Immigration and Development Company of Guthrie, Oklahoma) who published and distributed brochures promoting the town as an elegant, tree-lined city with paved streets, numerous businesses, railroad service, and an artesian well. They sold 3,000 lots to buyers who discovered, on their arrival, that none of the information in the brochure was true. In addition to using false publicity, the three men did not have title to the lots they sold.\nStanley and Kline were convicted of mail fraud and sent to Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary. Stanley and Kline served two-year terms in the penitentiary. Douglas died of tuberculosis before beginning his sentence. The town nevertheless took shape and incorporated on July 20, 1925.\nThe Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture says that the origin of the town name is unclear, but offers three possibilities: (1) a Captain Boice who was a hero in the Civil War, (2) the town of Boise, Idaho or (3) the Boise Cattle Company, which ran cattle in the area.  It was speculated in Ken Burns' documentary, The Dust Bowl, that the town name was chosen as part of the original land scam to evoke a false image of the town, as \"boisé\" is French for \"wooded\".\nBoise City's prosperity in the 1930s, like that of Cimarron County generally, was severely affected by its location at the heart of the Dust Bowl region.\nBoise City was the location of an unusual event during World War II when it was mistakenly bombed by a friendly U.S. bomber crew during training. The bombing occurred on July 5, 1943, at approximately 12:30 a.m. by a B-17 Flying Fortress Bomber. This occurred because pilots performing target practice became disoriented and mistook the four lights centered around the town's main square as their target. No one was killed in the attack and there was minimal damage, as only practice bombs with four pounds of dynamite and ninety pounds of sand were used and the square was deserted, but the pilots were embarrassed. For the 50th anniversary of the incident, the crew of the bomber was invited back to Boise City, but all members declined, some for health reasons and others because they did not want to draw more attention to their mishap. The B-17's former radio operator did, however, send an audio tape that was played at the celebration.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBoise City is located at 36°43′48″N 102°30′41″W (36.730115, -102.511419).  According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.3 square miles (3.4 km2), all land.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nBoise City experiences a semi-arid climate (Köppen BSk) with mild, dry winters and long, hot, wetter summers. There is a large degree of diurnal temperature variation year-round.\nAccording to weather data tallied between July 1, 1985, and June 30, 2015, for every location in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's official climate database, Boise City, Oklahoma, is the snowiest place in the state of Oklahoma with an average of 31.8 inches of snow per year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of the census of 2020, there were 1,166 people and 440 households. The population density was 1,180.6 inhabitants per square mile (455.8/km2). There were 675 housing units (230.4/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 87.5% White (61.6% non-Hispanic), 0.1% African American, 0.3% Native American, 0.0% Asian, 3.6% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 34.4% of the population.\nAs of 2020, there were 440 households, with an average family size of 3 people. 46.8% were married couples living together, 28.63% had a female householder with no husband present, 13.8% had a male householder with no husband\nMidwest City is a city in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, United States, and a part of the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the population was 58,409, making it the eighth largest city in the state.\nThe city was developed in response to talk of an air field being located nearby and named for the Tinker Air Force Base's original designation as the Midwest Air Depot. The city suffered damage during two tornadoes, the first in May 1999 and the second on May 8, 2003.\n\n\n== History ==\nW.P. \"Bill\" Atkinson bought land in the area that would become Midwest City after hearing speculation that an air field was going to be built nearby. The city, which was incorporated on March 11, 1943, was named for the air field's original designation as the Midwest Air Depot. When Major General Clarence L. Tinker of Pawhuska, Oklahoma became the first American general killed in World War II (June 7, 1942) near Wake Island, the airfield was renamed in his honor.\nSeward Mott, the director of the Federal Housing Administration's Land Planning Division, helped design the city, gaining national print and broadcast attention, and it became a model for postwar community development. The city incorporated the Mishak community of Czech and German immigrants that had formed in what now is the southeast part of the city.\nIn 1947, returning veteran Nicholas Harroz opened Nick's Brett Drive Grocery, which later became Crest Discount Foods, which is now one of the largest discount chains in the Oklahoma City metro area. Soon after its opening, Midwest City citizens opted for a charter-council-city manager form of government to better manage their rapid growth.\nMidwest City's regional hospital was dedicated October 6, 1962, built with the use of bond money. Voters also approved the creation of a junior college district in 1968. Oscar Rose Junior College opened its doors to students in 1970 and is now known as Rose State College. The Heritage Park Mall opened in 1978 on North Air Depot and was a prime shopping area in the city for several decades. The first Sam's Club was opened in Midwest City on April 7, 1983.\nIn the early 1970s, the Glenwood Addition subdivision, just north of the TAFB runway, was purchased from individual owners with funds raised in a county-wide bond election after plane crashes in the area killed several civilians and military crewmen. 835 homes were moved and an elementary school was closed down. The former subdivision is fenced off and used as storage and training exercises for TAFB personnel.\nPortions of Midwest City particularly northwest of Tinker Air Force Base sustained extreme damage from a violent tornado that swept through the southern and eastern areas of the Oklahoma City Metro on May 3, 1999. While it produced F5 damage in South Oklahoma City, damage in Midwest City was rated high-end F4 (although F5 was considered), with numerous destroyed homes and three fatalities. Another strong tornado struck almost exactly the same area four years later on May 8, 2003.\nCity officials worked to revitalize S.E. 29th Street in the early 21st century, leading to the development of a new Town Center Plaza shopping area that faces Interstate 40 and Tinker Air Force Base. The Town Center Plaza development replaced an aging, largely deserted Atkinson Plaza shopping center. In 2003, the Reed Center, a 60,000-square-foot (5,600 m2) convention center, was built. Meanwhile, the Heritage Park Mall has slowly dwindled, becoming an issue of contention in the 2010 mayoral race.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 24.6 square miles (64 km2), all land. The city's elevation is 1,157 feet above sea level.\nThe city is located in Oklahoma County and the area is known for low hills and two species of blackjack oak and post oak.

More than 70 undergraduate majors are offered, as well as 20 graduate degrees, including a JD, MBA, MFA, and PhD in Nursing. An Adult Studies Program for working adults offers a Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts degree. The university has approximately 3,000 students, including 1,200 graduate students. The official school and athletic colors are blue and white.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nOklahoma City University began as Epworth University, a project by local developer Anton H. Classen, who sought to begin a Methodist university in conjunction with other development projects. Construction began in 1902 and the school opened in 1904, three years before statehood, with an enrollment of 100 students. Anton Classen was heavily involved with development of early Oklahoma City and advanced the idea of a Methodist university in Oklahoma and helped spark the ideas of the Methodist Church to establish a Methodist university in Oklahoma. Construction began in 1902 and classes started in 1904 with enrollment growing by almost 100 students during that first year.\nEpworth closed in 1911 after the school ran into financial difficulties. The church then formed Methodist University of Oklahoma in Guthrie, Oklahoma, which also absorbed a Methodist college in Texas, Fort Worth University. Eventually, the school's trustees developed a plan to close the school in Guthrie and reopen in Oklahoma City. The school opened in Oklahoma City as Oklahoma City College in 1919, bolstered by funding from Methodist congregations. The college experienced rapid growth and changed its name to Oklahoma City University in 1924. Despite the success and growth of the university in the 1920s, OCU again fell on hard times during the Great Depression.\n\n\n=== Post-war era ===\nDr. Cluster Smith became president of Oklahoma City University after the Great Depression. When the United States entered World War II, the school faced new challenges, including mounting debt and a need for new facilities. Enrollment dipped during the war, as men left campus to enlist in the military. By 1942, the student body was 75 percent female. This created a shortage of players and funds causing many of the athletic programs, such as the football team, to end operations. After the war,m enrollment increased dramatically and the university began a period of rapid development through the remainder of the 1940s. In the 1950s, OCU received accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. The university then took control of the Oklahoma City College of Law and began a partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to elevate the academics and the quality of education. The Bishop W. Angie Smith Chapel was dedicated in 1968 as part of a plan to expand OCU's spiritual life.\nIn the mid-1970s, after nearly 25 years of steady growth, the university again fell on hard times. In 1976 United Methodist Bishop Paul Milhouse discussed the school's issues to the Annual Conference of Oklahoma United Methodist churches in Tulsa.  After requesting that people direct their prayers and pledges to the university, by 1980 the Methodist Church had raised more than $3 million. Jerald Walker, an OCU alumnus, became president in 1979 and continued the university's growth stemming from the financial support from the Church. During his tenure as president facilities were improved, new academic programs were started and enrollment increased again. In 1981 it was announced that the university was out of debt and turned a surplus for the first time since 1975. The university added the School of Religion and the nursing program during\nOklahoma is a state located in the Southern United States. According to the 2020 census, Oklahoma is the 28th most populous state with 3,959,353 inhabitants but the 19th largest by land area spanning 68,594.92 square miles (177,660.0 km2) of land. Oklahoma is divided into 77 counties and contains 596 municipalities consisting of cities and towns.\nIn Oklahoma, cities are all those communities which are 1,000 or more in population and are incorporated as cities. Towns are limited to town board type of municipal government. Cities may choose among aldermanic, mayoral, council-manager, and home-rule charter types of government. Cities may also petition to incorporate as towns.\n\n\n== List of municipalities ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of unincorporated communities in Oklahoma\nList of census-designated places in Oklahoma\nList of ghost towns in Oklahoma\nList of Oklahoma placenames of Native American origin\nList of city nicknames in Oklahoma\nOklahoma statistical areas\n\n\n== References ==\nDel City is a city in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, United States, and a part of the  Oklahoma City metropolitan area. The population was  21,822 at the United States Census, 2020, a 2.3% increase from 2010.\nDel City is located near two major interstate highways, both of which connect it to Oklahoma City. Interstate 40 bisects the town from the northwest to southeast, and Interstate 35 lies just a short distance west of the city. The city borders southeast Oklahoma City, Midwest City and Tinker Air Force Base. George Epperly, founded the city, which was incorporated by a vote of its residents in 1948. Del City is named after Epperly's eldest daughter, Delaphene Campbell. Since its incorporation Del City has expanded three times, first by annexing Carter Park in 1954, Midway Village in 1963 and the acquisition of an undeveloped piece of land between the city and Tinker AFB\nA large area of Del City was significantly impacted by the May 3, 1999, tornado outbreak that passed through the Oklahoma City metro area.\n\n\n== History ==\nFounded in Boone Township, Oklahoma County, as a \"bedroom\" community, Del City lies three miles (5 km) east of Oklahoma City and one mile (1.6 km) west of Midwest City. At the turn of the 21st century, Del City was a 7.5-square-mile (19 km2) community surrounded on the north, west, and south by Oklahoma City and on the east by Midwest City. Interstate Highway 40 bisects the town from the northwest to southeast. Oklahoma City streets define the boundaries: NE 10th Street on the north; Sooner Road on the east; SE 44th Street on the south; and Bryant Avenue on the west. Northwestern corner of the city is a mile from the junction of Interstate 35 and Interstate 40, justifying its claim to being \"the Crossroads of America.\"\nIn the Land Run of 1889, Jordan Pybas and his wife settled in what is present-day Del City. Five generations later the family still lives in the house that was completed in 1907.  Before 1946 there were only two families living in what would become Del City. Developer George Epperly purchased a wheat field 160 acres (0.65 km2) large at the corner of SE 29th Street and Sunnylane Road in 1946 with a plan to build fifty houses. In 1948 there were 582 homes in Del City, 75% of which were built by George Epperly, Despite opposition, the unincorporated Epperly Heights and its 200 families voted to approve incorporation on October 9, 1948. In February 1959, Del City adopted a charter and a council-manager form of town government. The city was named for Epperly's daughter, Delaphene Campbell.\nThe city expanded through the annexation of Carter Park in 1954 and Midway Village in 1963. Del City attempted to annex the Rose Smith Addition but its residents incorporated and became the town of Smith Village.  The city also acquired a piece of undeveloped land that separated it from Tinker Air Force Base. Oklahoma City annexed this same piece of land, and a court fight ensued. In District court, Del City won and Oklahoma City appealed to the State Supreme Court. Del City officials, while awaiting the hearing, pursued negotiation again with Oklahoma City this time accepting 20 acres (81,000 m2) along the Tinker AFB boundary. Del City, having expanded to its greatest possible physical limits in 1964, joined Midwest City and Norman in underwriting the Little River Reservoir Project that became Lake Thunderbird.\nThe Del City Historical Society was organized in 1975 with Andy Evans as its first president. Several children of the Eighty-niners (89ers) still lived in the area, and they identified every original homestead within city limits. Residents also learned that their town was on the path of the 1870s Arbuckle Trail, a Texas to Kansas cattle trail. Wrestler and two-time Olympic Gold Medal winner John Smith resided in Del City.\nWith home building and family-oriented amenities the founding focus, industry was slow to develop in Del City to create any jobs (99 percent of Del Citians commuted to work in 1948, while \nElk City is a city in Beckham County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 11,561 at the time of the 2020 census, a slight decrease from the 11,693 figure of the 2010 census.  Elk City is located on Interstate 40 and Historic U.S. Route 66 in western Oklahoma, approximately 110 miles (180 km) west of Oklahoma City and 150 miles (240 km) east of Amarillo, Texas.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== European exploration ===\n\nIn 1541, Francisco Vásquez de Coronado became the first known European to pass through the area. The Spanish conquistador was traveling northeast across the prairie in search of a place called Quivira, a city said to be fabulously wealthy with gold. Because Coronado's route across the plains is speculative, it is quite possible that the expedition passed through present-day Elk City or the nearby area.\n\n\n=== Founding to statehood ===\nElk City's history dates back to the days immediately following the opening of the Cheyenne-Arapaho reservation in western Oklahoma Territory on April 19, 1892, when the first white settlers made their appearance. Prior to this time, many early ranchers had driven cattle over the Great Western Cattle Trail from Texas to Dodge City, Kansas, the present townsite of Elk City being in the direct path of that famous trail.\nThe creation of Elk City was an idea conceived by land promoters from Weatherford, Oklahoma, when they learned that the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad (CO & G) was coming to the area (in 1898, the CO & G Railroad completed its western route to Weatherford; beginning in 1901, it continued building west). They formed the Choctaw Townsite and Development Company. These men with great foresight determined that the area at the source of Elk Creek would be an ideal location for a town, so they came to the area to purchase lands from the homesteaders who had claims along the railroad.\nProbably the most important day in Elk City's history is March 20, 1901, the date the first lots were sold by the Choctaw Townsite and Development Company. By this time, hundreds of prospective purchasers had built a tent city. On that day, the townsite company sold $32,000 worth of property (about $870,000 in 2012 dollars) and continued doing a good business for some time thereafter.\nThere is some confusion about how Elk City got its name. Elk City was so named because it is located at the head of Elk Creek, which in turn was named by U.S. Army Captain Randolph B. Marcy who was leading an expedition to explore the Red River in 1852. Marcy and his troops had left the Wichita Mountains and the waterway which he named Otter Creek during his exploration, and they were traveling northwest along the North Fork of the Red River. On May 31, in the official journal of the expedition, Marcy wrote about the productive soil, the dense grass, and the vertical red clay banks of a \"bold running stream of good water.\" Continuing, he wrote, \"From the circumstance of having seen elk tracks upon the stream we passed in our march today, I have called it 'Elk Creek'. I am informed by our guide that five years since, elk were frequently seen in the Wichita Mountains; but now they are seldom met with in this part of the country.\" Confusion also stems from the early post offices that served the residents of the town. Even though the town of Elk City has had only one name, its early settlers were served by a post office named Crowe, and later, one named Busch. Consequently, on many early maps of Oklahoma Territory the names of \"Crowe\" or \"Busch\" are seen instead of \"Elk City\". Finally, on July 20, 1907, shortly before statehood, the Busch Post Office had its name officially changed to Elk City Post Office.\nOn August 13, 1901, the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad (purchased in 1904 by the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad in 1904) laid its last rail on the so-called \"Choctaw Route\", bringing rail access to Elk City. The first regular train service commenced seven days later on August 20, and city folk rejoic\nUSS Oklahoma City (CL-91/CLG-5/CG-5) was one of 27 United States Navy Cleveland-class light cruisers completed during or shortly after World War II, and one of six to be converted to guided missile cruisers. She was the first US Navy ship to be named for Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Commissioned in late 1944, she participated in the latter part of the Pacific War in anti-aircraft screening and shore bombardment roles, for which she earned two battle stars. She then served a brief stint with the occupation force. Like all but one of her sister ships, she was retired in the post-war defense cutbacks, becoming part of the Pacific Reserve Fleet in 1947.\nIn the late 1950s she was converted to a Galveston-class guided missile cruiser, which involved removing all her guns except for her forward 6-inch (152 mm) turret and 5-inch (127 mm) mount, and rebuilding her entire superstructure to accommodate the Talos missile system and flagship office spaces and accommodation. Like her three sister ships (Providence, Little Rock, and Springfield) of the Cleveland-class ships converted to missile ships, she was also extensively modified forward to become a flagship. This involved removal of most of her forward armament to allow for a greatly enlarged superstructure. She was recommissioned in 1960 as CLG-5 (and in 1975 redesignated CG-5).\nIn her second career she served extensively in the Pacific, playing a prominent role in the Vietnam War, including participation in the evacuation of Saigon. Oklahoma City was worked hard in shore bombardment duty during the war. As she was extensively well fitted with flagship accommodations and communications, there were plans for an extensive overhaul (of both her and Little Rock) starting in 1977. The ship would have received two 8-cell NATO Sea Sparrow surface-to-air missile (SAM) launchers and two Vulcan Phalanx CIWS systems, in addition to extensive rehabilitation of her propulsion systems, electrical systems, her hull and superstructure. This would have given her an additional 10 years of service life. While this work package was formally planned, and funding was appropriated, it was diverted elsewhere.  She received enough maintenance to soldier on for a few more years and was decommissioned for the last time in December 1979. At the time of her decommissioning, she was the last Cleveland-class ship in service, and had served longer (a total of 21 years and 10 months) than any other ship of that class.\nOklahoma City was sunk during a weapons training exercise, Tandem Thrust 99, on 26 March 1999.\n\n\n== Construction and commissioning ==\nOklahoma City was laid down on 8 December 1942, by Cramp Shipbuilding of Philadelphia; launched on 20 February 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Anton H. Classen; and commissioned on 22 December 1944.\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nFollowing shakedown, Oklahoma City transited the Panama Canal and reported to Commander Cruisers Pacific Fleet (ComCruPac) for duty, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 2 May 1945. She conducted local operations until 22 May, when she sailed for Ulithi, thence to rendezvous on 6 June, with Carrier Task Group 38.1 for operations in support of the Okinawa campaign. For the rest of June, and into July, she screened 3rd Fleet carriers during their intensified air operations against Japanese forces. On 18 July, she formed a bombardment group with other cruisers and destroyers, then rejoined the carrier task group for continued action against the Japanese home islands. At the end of hostilities, she continued to patrol off the coast of Japan and it was not until 10 September, after seventy-two days of continuous steaming, that she finally entered Tokyo Bay. Oklahoma City remained on occupation duty until relieved on 30 January 1946, when she departed for the United States. She arrived at San Francisco on 14 February, where she remained until 15 August, when she entered the Mare Island Navy Yard for inactivation. On 30 June 1947, she was placed out of comm\nThe 2013 Moore tornado was a large and extremely violent EF5 tornado that ravaged Moore, Oklahoma, and adjacent areas on the afternoon of May 20, 2013, with peak winds estimated at 210 miles per hour (340 km/h), killing 24 people (plus two indirect fatalities) and injuring 212 others. The tornado was part of a larger outbreak from a slow-moving weather system that had produced several other tornadoes across the Great Plains over the previous two days, including five that had struck portions of Central Oklahoma the day prior on May 19.\nThe tornado touched down just northwest of Newcastle at 2:56 p.m. CDT (19:56 UTC), and quickly became violent, persisting for 39 minutes on a 13.85-mile (22.3 km) path through a heavily populated section of Moore, causing catastrophic damage of EF4 to EF5 intensity, before dissipating at 3:35 p.m. CDT (20:35 UTC) outside of Moore. The tornado was over one mile (1.6 km) across at its peak width.: 13  The 2013 Moore tornado followed a roughly similar track to the deadlier 1999 Bridge Creek–Moore tornado, which was rated F5; neither of the stricken schools in the area had acquired purpose-built storm shelters in the intervening years.\nThe tornado caused catastrophic damage around the city of Moore, with 1,150 homes destroyed as a result. Damage estimates ranged up to $2 billion, making it the costliest tornado since the 2011 Joplin tornado. As of 2024, this tornado is the most recent tornado to be rated EF5.\n\n\n== Meteorological synopsis ==\n\nOn May 20, 2013, a prominent central upper trough moved eastward toward the Central United States, with a lead upper low pivoting over the Dakotas and Upper Midwest region. A Southern stream shortwave trough and a moderately strong polar jet moved east northeastward over the southern Rockies to the southern Great Plains and Ozarks area, with severe thunderstorms forming during the peak hours of heating. With the influence of moderately strong cyclonic flow aloft, the air mass was expected to become unstable across much of the southern Great Plains, Ozarks, and middle Mississippi Valley by the afternoon hours.\nEvidence of an unstable air mass included temperatures in the low to mid 80s °F (27–30 °C), dewpoints that ranged in the upper 60s °F (20 °C) to the lower 70s °F (20–22 °C), and CAPE values ranging from 3500 to 5000 J/kg. Deep-layer wind shear speeds of 40 to 50 knots (46 to 58 mph) enhanced storm structure and intensity. These were present ahead of a cold front extending from a surface low in the eastern Dakotas, southwestward to near the Kansas City area and western Oklahoma, and ahead of a dry line extending from southwest Oklahoma southward into northwestern and west-central Texas. Outflow remnants from the previous night and the early day convection across the Ozarks and the middle Mississippi Valley were a factor in severe weather development with the most aggressive heating and destabilization on the western edge of this activity across the southern Great Plains and just ahead of a cold front. The National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma had warned as early as May 15 that there would be a possibility of severe weather on May 20.\nThe most intense severe weather activity was expected to come across the southern Great Plains, specifically Central Oklahoma, during the afternoon hours on that Monday. As such, the Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk of severe thunderstorms during the early morning hours of May 20 from southeastern Missouri to north-central Texas. The degree of wind shear, moisture, and instability within the warm sector favored the development of supercells. Very large hail and tornadoes were both expected with these supercells, with the possibility of a few strong tornadoes. The Storm Prediction Center issued a tornado watch at 1:10 p.m. Central Daylight Time (CDT) early that afternoon for the eastern two-thirds of Oklahoma, northwestern Arkansas, and portions of north-central Texas. Given the atmospheric parameters t\nKaw City is a city in eastern Kay County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 325 as of the 2020 United States census. Kaw City was named for the Kanza Indians, called the Kaw by locals.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1902, the original Kaw City was founded, prior to Oklahoma statehood, as a farming community in the fertile oxbow bend of the Arkansas River. Kaw City was across the river from the Kaw Indian reservation and the Kaw Agency. By statehood in 1907, it had 486 inhabitants. Although the original town site is now inundated by the waters of Kaw Lake, the old town was quite a busy place.\nIt became a booming oil town in 1919, when 'black gold' was discovered in nearby Kay County and the present Osage Nation reservation. The population jumped from 627 in 1920 to 1,001 in 1930. It even had a very popular four-story hotel filled with one of the world's rarest art collections. Laura A. Clubb, owner of the collection and wife of a local rancher, later donated her collection to Philbrook Art Museum.\nThe majority of the town was overcome by a (weather-related) flood in 1923, and then devastated again by the Great Depression.\nIn the late 1960s, the Army Corps of Engineers constructed Kaw Dam on the Arkansas River just south of the original Kaw City site. It then went underwater permanently in 1976, when the gates of the Kaw Dam closed and turned that particular area of the Arkansas River into Kaw Lake. Dave Morgan, a banker and oilman in nearby Blackwell, Oklahoma loaned the town the money it needed to move two miles to the west, up on a hill by the town's cemetery. The first house was built in the summer of 1969 and first mail delivery was on June 26, 1972. Many buildings in Kaw City, including the old Santa Fe Railroad Depot which is now the Kaw City Museum, were moved to the town's present location, on high ground near the lake. The Santa Fe Railroad Depot is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The depot is one of only two listed structures that have been moved from their original locations elsewhere in Oklahoma, the other being Will Rogers Homestead near Claremore, which was also moved to make way for a lake. When the water in the lake is exceptionally low, some of the foundations of the old structures can still be seen just above the water.\nThe Kaw City Cemetery (all headstones and the majority of the caskets) were also moved and given a separate section within Ponca City's IOOF cemetery, west of Conoco just south of Highway 60. The Kaw Indian cemetery located across the Arkansas river in Washunga was moved to Newkirk, Oklahoma.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nKaw City is located on a peninsula extending into the Kaw Lake impoundment of the Arkansas River. Washunga lies to the north across the lake. Oklahoma State Highway 11 passes through the community.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 5.5 square miles (14 km2), of which 2.7 square miles (7.0 km2) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3 km2) (51.26%) is water.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 372 people, 159 households, and 109 families residing in the city.

The population was 738 at the time of the 2020 census, up from 697 at the 2010 census. It was named after J. O. Elmore.\nThere are two main highways running through Elmore City. One of the Highways is Oklahoma State Highway 29, running west–east. The other is Oklahoma State Highway 74, running north–south. It is about 12 miles (19 km) west of Wynnewood, 25+1⁄2 miles (41 km) south of Purcell, and 23 miles (37 km) west of U.S. Highway 177.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first business in Elmore City was opened by Jasper N. Black in an area just northeast of what is now Elmore City. Historians state that after Black opened his supply store in 1890 on Rock Creek, the number of settlers quickly grew and a community was formed called Banner. Banner quickly spread to the southwest and a post office was established and the name changed to Elmore for J. O. Elmore, another prominent business man. The word city was added to Elmore after the name was confused with Elmer in Jackson County. The city was incorporated as a community in 1898.\nAt the time of its founding, Elmore City was located in Pickens County, Chickasaw Nation.\nThe film Footloose was loosely based on events that took place in the town.  Elmore City had a ban, dating from before statehood, on public dancing within town limits. High school students during the 1979-1980 class year began lobbying for the right to hold a school prom with dancing.  However, during the first town meeting on the issue, perhaps three-quarters of the crowd was against the idea, led by local church leaders.  The controversy was picked up by local newspapers, went national, and ended up as a small item in a San Francisco paper.  This was where songwriter/screenwriter Dean Pitchford, who was looking for a movie musical idea, ran across it.  The eventual result was the 1984 movie.  As to the prom, the town mayor sided with the kids, declaring that a high school function was not a “public” event.  The school board then authorized the prom, which proceeded and received national coverage.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.4 square miles (1.0 km2), all land.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 697 people living in the town.

Oklahoma County is at the heart of the Oklahoma City metropolitan statistical area.\nOklahoma County is one of seven counties in the United States to share the same name as the state it is located in (the other six being Arkansas County, Hawaii County, Idaho County, Iowa County, New York County (Manhattan), and Utah County), and the only one of the seven to contain the state capital, and one of two to contain a city of the same name as well.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe area that would someday be called Oklahoma County was originally inhabited by members of the indigenous nations of the Southern Plains, but by the 1830s the land would become part of the territory assigned to the Seminoles and Creeks after their removal from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern USA.\nAs a result of the Reconstruction era treaties signed between the US government and the Seminole and Creek nations in 1866, the land was taken from tribal jurisdiction but not assigned to other tribal governments, which in time led it to be called the Unassigned Lands. In 1889, the US federal government held a land run for the Unassigned lands, which led to the rapid settlement of the area.\nBy 1890, Oklahoma County was called \"County Two\" and was one of seven counties established by the Organic Act of 1890.\nCounty business initially took place in a building at the intersection of California Avenue and Robinson Street until the construction of the first Oklahoma County Courthouse at 520 West Main Street in the 1900s. In 1937, the county government was moved to a building at 321 Park Avenue, which now serves only as the county courthouse.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 718 square miles (1,860 km2), of which 709 square miles (1,840 km2) is land and 9.6 square miles (25 km2) (1.3%) is water.\n\n\n=== Transit ===\nEmbark\nOklahoma City Streetcar\nFlixbus\nGreyhound Lines\nAmtrak (Heartland Flyer) at Oklahoma City station\n\n\n=== Major highways ===\n I-35\n I-40\n I-44\n I-235\n I-240\n I-335\n I-344\n US 62\n US 66\n US 77\n US 270\n Turner Turnpike\n Kilpatrick Turnpike\n Kickapoo Turnpike\n SH-3\n SH-3A\n SH-66\n SH-74\n SH-77H\n SH-152\n SH-270\n\n\n=== Adjacent counties ===\n\n\n=== National protected area ===\nOklahoma City National Memorial\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAccording to the 2010 U.S. census, there were 718,633 people, 277,615 households, and 172,572 families residing in the county. The population density was 1,013 inhabitants per square mile (391/km2). There were 319,828 housing units at an average density of 416 units per square mile (161 units/km2). The racial makeup of the county was 64.6% White, 15.4% Black or African American, 3.5% Native American, 3% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 8.1% from other races, and 5.3% from two or more races; 15.1% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. Throughout its population, 12.4% were of German, 12.3% Mexican, 10.1% Irish, 7.9% English, and 7.7% American ancestries according to the 2010 census. 84.4% spoke English and 11.5% Spanish as their first language.\nAt the 2020 U.S. census, its population increased to 796,292, with a 2022-estimate at 802,559. Racially, the 2021 American Community Survey estimated 54.5% were non-Hispanic white, 15.8% Black or African American, 4.7% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 5.8% multiracial, and 18.5% Hispanic or Latino of any race. An estimated 10.2% of its population between 2017 and 2021 were foreign-born residents.\nIn 2010, there were 277,615 households, out of which 28.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 43.1% were married couples living together, 15.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 37.8% were non-families. 31.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.7% ha\nMoore is a city in Cleveland County, Oklahoma, United States, and is part of the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. The population was 62,793 at the 2020 census, making Moore the seventh-largest city in the state of Oklahoma.\nLocated between Oklahoma City and Norman, the city has been the site of several devastating tornadoes, with those occurring in 1999 and 2013 receiving international attention. The 3 costliest tornadoes in Oklahoma history all occurred in Moore.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Moore post office was established May 27, 1889, during the Land Run of 1889 and was named for Al Moore, an Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway employee. According to the town history he was a \"conductor or a brakeman, lived in a boxcar at the camp and had difficulty receiving his mail. He painted his name – \"Moore\" – on a board and nailed it on the boxcar. When a postmaster was appointed, he continued to call the settlement Moore. When the town incorporated in 1893 the name was legalized.\"\nThe city's history notes that the community before the post office may have been called \"Verbeck\" by the railroad. However, other histories indicate that Verbeck was actually the original name of the nearby telegraph station \"Oklahoma\" which became the basis for the founding of Oklahoma City.\nThe community remained small until 1961, when it annexed 21.6 square miles (56 km2), becoming a full-fledged city in 1962, which in turn increased its population from 1,221 in 1960 to 18,761 in 1970 and 55,081 in 2010. Moore's 1961 annexation kept it an independent city at a time when Oklahoma City through annexations increased its size from 25 square miles (65 km2) to 643 square miles (1,670 km2) surrounding Moore on three sides (north, east, west). Norman forms its southern border.\nIn 1966 the Hillsdale Free Will Baptist College, after moving through various locations around Oklahoma, opened in the community.\nThe Moore post office turned into a branch of the Oklahoma City post office on January 7, 1972.\nIn the 1970s the city launched a \"Smile America\" campaign in which giant red, white and blue smileys were painted on the town water towers. A smiley also adorns the city's official logo (as does a water tower). Some of the water towers now have a sign that says, \"Moore - Home of Toby Keith.\"\nOn September 24, 2014, at the local Vaughan Foods food processing plant, one employee was beheaded with a knife and another coworker had her throat slit and was injured, but survived. The alleged attacker, 30-year-old Alton Nolen, who was on suspension from the plant prior to the attack due to interactions with the employee who survived the attack, was shot and wounded by company owner Mark Vaughan. Nolen was convicted of murder and assault in October 2017. A jury recommended that he receive the death penalty, and, on December 15, 2017, a judge sentenced Nolen to death by lethal injection.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMoore is located just south of Oklahoma City and north of Norman, in central Oklahoma. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 22.2 square miles (57.4 km2), of which 21.8 square miles (56.5 km2) is land and 0.35 square miles (0.9 km2), or 1.52%, is water.\nThe city lies in the Sandstone Hills region of Oklahoma, known for hills, blackjack oak, and post oak.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nMoore has a humid subtropical climate with frequent variations in weather during part of the year and consistently hot summers. Prolonged and heavy rainfall often leads to flash flooding. Consistent winds, usually from the south or south-southeast during the summer, help temper the hotter weather. Consistent northerly winds during the winter can intensify cold periods. Severe ice storms and snowstorms happen sporadically during the winter.\n\n\n=== Tornado history ===\n\nThe Oklahoma City metropolitan area (of which Moore is a part) is located in Tornado Alley and is subject to frequent and severe tornadoes and hailstorms, making it one of the most tornado-prone major metropolitan ar\nThe Oklahoma City Butcher is an unidentified serial killer who murdered three women between 1976 and 1986 in Oklahoma City. The killer murdered, dismembered, and mutilated young homeless Native American women.\n\n\n== Victims ==\n\n\n=== Cathy Lyn Shakelford ===\nThe first known victim was Cathy Lyn Shakelford, a member of the Sac and Fox Nation. She ran away at the age of 17 and lived homeless in Oklahoma City. The last sighting of her alive was two months before her death, when she was being treated at the Oklahoma City Hospital.\nHer remains were discovered in an abandoned house by three oil workers on April 1, 1976, who called the police after they found her head in a popcorn bucket. The victim's legs, arms, and torso were later found spread throughout the home. Her sexual organs and hand were removed and never found. The perpetrator also mutilated Shakelford's face by carving a smile into it.\nShe remained unidentified until 1993, when her cousin, Andra Medina, reported her missing to the police. She contacted Sergeant Norma Adams, who connected the missing Cathy Lyn Shakelford to the unidentified woman. They were later confirmed to be the same person after DNA testing.\n\n\n=== Arley Bell Killian ===\nOn April 19, 1979, children playing basketball in a park discovered a human head.  Over the next few days, police found more of her remains scattered throughout the neighborhood. Some of the body parts were wrapped in bags and newspapers. The body parts had an odd absence of blood because the killer  washed them before disposing of them. Her left hand, pelvis, head, shoe, and other parts of her flesh were found.\nShe was identified as 22-year-old Arley Bell Killian a week later. Killian was homeless due to substance abuse caused by her father beating and raping her when she was 16. She was last seen just four hours before her head was discovered in the park.\nOver the next two months, the police found more body parts. Some speculated that the killer was playing a game - disposing of the woman's body parts to toy with the police.\n\n\n=== Tina Marcia Sanders ===\nThe final victim was 22-year-old Tina Marcia Sanders, a homeless Native American woman. Her torso and left leg were found in an alleyway by a man walking in his backyard on March 6, 1986. Her head, which was set on fire, was found just a block away in a garbage bin the following week. She was quickly identified because of her tattoos. She was last seen just a day prior to her death.\n\n\n== Announcement of a serial killer ==\nWeeks after the murder of Tina Marcia Sanders, police linked her murder to murders of the previous two victims. Police believe that all of the victims were killed by a single perpetrator.  All of the victims killed, dismembered, and mutilated in a similar manner. The first two victims had unique cuts on their lower lip, all of the victims were beheaded, and the victims sexual organs were removed and never found. Furthermore, all victims were young homeless Native American women.\n\n\n== Suspect ==\n\n\n=== Henry Lee Lucas ===\nHenry Lee Lucas was a drifter and American serial killer who confessed to hundreds of unsolved murders. One of these murders was the murder of Arley Bell Killian. However, it's quite possible that Henry Lee Lucas was not the perpetrator because he falsely confessed to murdering hundreds of women.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of fugitives from justice who disappeared\nList of serial killers in the United States\n\n\n== References ==",

Nichols had assisted with the bomb's preparation. Motivated by his dislike for the U.S. federal government and its handling of Ruby Ridge in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993, McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the fire that ended the siege in Waco.

Although the original town site is now inundated by the waters of Kaw Lake, the old town was quite a busy place.\nIt became a booming oil town in 1919, when 'black gold' was discovered in nearby Kay County and the present Osage Nation reservation. The population jumped from 627 in 1920 to 1,001 in 1930. It even had a very popular four-story hotel filled with one of the world's rarest art collections. Laura A. Clubb, owner of the collection and wife of a local rancher, later donated her collection to Philbrook Art Museum.\nThe majority of the town was overcome by a (weather-related) flood in 1923, and then devastated again by the Great Depression."

However, during the first town meeting on the issue, perhaps three-quarters of the crowd was against the idea, led by local church leaders.  The controversy was picked up by local newspapers, went national, and ended up as a small item in a San Francisco paper.  This was where songwriter/screenwriter Dean Pitchford, who was looking for a movie musical idea, ran across it.  The eventual result was the 1984 movie.  As to the prom, the town mayor sided with the kids, declaring that a high school function was not a “public” event.

According to the town history he was a \"conductor or a brakeman, lived in a boxcar at the camp and had difficulty receiving his mail. He painted his name – \"Moore\" – on a board and nailed it on the boxcar. When a postmaster was appointed, he continued to call the settlement Moore. When the town incorporated in 1893 the name was legalized.\"\nThe city's history notes that the community before the post office may have been called \"Verbeck\" by the railroad. However, other histories indicate that Verbeck was actually the original name of the nearby telegraph station \"Oklahoma\" which became the basis for the founding of Oklahoma City."
