Her widely known works include The Poisonwood Bible, the tale of a missionary family in the Congo, and Animal, Vegetable, Miracle, a nonfiction account of her family's attempts to eat locally. In 2023, she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for the novel Demon Copperhead. Her work often focuses on topics such as social justice, biodiversity, and the interaction between humans and their communities and environments.\nKingsolver has received numerous awards, including the Dayton Literary Peace Prize's Richard C. Holbrooke Distinguished Achievement Award 2011 and the National Humanities Medal. After winning for The Lacuna in 2010 and Demon Copperhead in 2023, Kingsolver became the first author to win the Women's Prize for Fiction twice.  Since 1993, each one of her book titles have been on the New York Times Best Seller list.\nKingsolver was raised in rural Kentucky, lived briefly in the Congo in her early childhood, and she currently lives in Appalachia. Kingsolver earned degrees in biology, ecology, and evolutionary biology at DePauw University and the University of Arizona, and worked as a freelance writer before she began writing novels. In 2000, the politically progressive Kingsolver established the Bellwether Prize to support \"literature of social change\".\n\n\n== Biography ==\nKingsolver was born in 1955 in Annapolis, Maryland, the daughter of Wendell Roy Kingsolver and Virginia Lee (n\u00e9e Henry) Kingsolver, but grew up in Carlisle, Kentucky. When Kingsolver was seven, her father, a physician, took the family to L\u00e9opoldville, Congo (now Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo).\nAfter graduating from high school, Kingsolver attended DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, on a music scholarship, studying classical piano. She changed her major to biology after realizing that \"classical pianists compete for six job openings a year, and the rest of [them] get to play 'Blue Moon' in a hotel lobby\".\nKingsolver was involved in activism on her campus, and took part in protests against the Vietnam War. In 1977, Kingsolver graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a Bachelor of Science, and moved to France for a year.  In 1980, she enrolled in graduate school at the University of Arizona, where she earned a master's degree in ecology and evolutionary biology.\nIn 1985, Kingsolver married Joseph Hoffmann, and gave birth to their daughter Camille in 1987.  During the first First Gulf War, she moved with her daughter to Tenerife in the Canary Islands for a year, mostly due to her frustration over America's military involvement. After returning to the United States in 1992, she separated from her husband.\nIn 1994, Kingsolver was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters from her alma mater, DePauw University. That same year, she married Steven Lee Hopp, an ornithologist, and their daughter Lily was born in 1996. In 2004, Kingsolver moved with her family to a farm in Washington County, Virginia. In 2008, she received an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Duke University, where she delivered a commencement address entitled \"How to Be Hopeful\".\nIn the late 1990s, Kingsolver was a founding member of the Rock Bottom Remainders, a rock-and-roll band made up of published writers. Other band members included Amy Tan, Matt Groening, Dave Barry, and Stephen King, and they played for one week during the year. Kingsolver played the keyboard, but is no longer an active member of the band.\nIn a 2010 interview with The Guardian, Kingsolver said, \"I never wanted to be famous, and still don't\u2026 the universe rewarded me with what I dreaded most\". She said she created her own website just to compete with a plethora of fake ones \"as a defense to protect my family from misinformation\".\nKingsolver lives in the Appalachia area of the United States. She said in 2020 that rural America is generally regarded by artistic elites with \"a profound antipathy\nDemon Copperhead is a 2022 novel by Barbara Kingsolver. It was a co-recipient of the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and won the 2023 Women's Prize for Fiction. Kingsolver was inspired by the Charles Dickens novel David Copperfield. While Kingsolver's novel is similarly about a boy who experiences poverty, Demon Copperhead is set in Appalachia and explores contemporary issues.\nThe book touches on themes of the social and economic stratification in Appalachia, child poverty in rural America, and drug addiction with a focus on the opioid crisis.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nDamon Fields is born to a single teenage mother in a trailer home in Lee County, located in the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia. He has red hair, inherited from his dead father, who was a Melungeon. He is nicknamed \"Demon Copperhead\" for the colour of his hair and his attitude. (Copperhead referring to the colour as well as snake species). Demon is raised by his mother and their neighbours, the Peggots. The latter includes Mr. and Mrs. Peggot, who are old and are raising their grandchild Matt Peggot (nicknamed Maggot). Maggot and Demon are the same age and the two become best friends growing up. \nWhen Demon is in primary school, his mother meets a trucker named Stoner and gets into a relationship with him. Over the summer, the Peggots take Demon on a trip to Knoxville, where he meets Maggot\u2019s aunt June and his cousin Emmy. Upon his return, he discovers that his mother has married Stoner, following which Stoner\u2019s behaviour becomes abusive. She relapses into her former drug addiction and ODs. Stoner pays for her to be sent to rehab. Demon\u2019s DSS agent puts him in short-term foster care.\nHis foster home is at Creaky Farms, run by Mr. Crickson who also fosters three other kids: Tommy, Swap-Out, and Fast Forward. Tommy and Swap-Out are in primary school with Demon, while Fast Forward is in high-school playing as a quarterback for the Lee High School football team, the Generals. Demon's time at Creaky Farms is coloured by Crickson's mean demeanour, the squalid living conditions, and assisting with farm work. This includes the tobacco season, where the foster-children are forced to miss school and Demon gets nicotine poisoning from handling the plants without gloves. Fast Forward has a magnetic personality and holds influence over the other foster children, introducing them to drugs. \nDemon's mom ODs again, on oxycontin, and dies. His time at Creaky Farms over, Demon decides to spend Christmas with the Peggots instead, and joins them uninvited on another trip to Knoxville. He discovers that June has decided to move back to Lee County from the city due to the fact that her colleagues demean her for being a 'redneck'. \nAfter a second failed foster family, Demon decides to hitchhike to Murder Valley, Tennessee, where he hopes to find his paternal grandmother. En route, he meets a preacher, gets his money stolen by a prostitute, and sleeps in a barn. Finally, he reaches his grandmother, Betsy Woodall, a hardy old woman who lives with her disabled brother Dick who is confined to a wheelchair and cannot speak normally, but is sharp and well-read. Using her connections, she contacts the Coach of the Lee High Generals, who agrees to take Demon in. Demon moves to a mansion where he meets Coach, his daughter Angus, and a young man who assists the coach named U-Haul. Coach struggles with alcoholism, but recognises Demon's potential as a football player. He starts training him to be a tight end, and Demon eventually becomes a player for the Generals. \nDemon learns about the history of the Appalachian Mountains and the coal miners from Mr. Armstrong, who tells them the story of the Battle of Blair Mountain. In the summer after he joins high school, Demon takes a job at a farm supply store and meets Dori, a young girl his age who he instantly falls in love with. Dori's mother is dead and she has dropped out of school to take care of her ailing father. During one of the football games, Demon ge\nThe Lacuna is a 2009 novel by Barbara Kingsolver. It is Kingsolver's sixth novel, and won the 2010 Orange Prize for Fiction and the Library of Virginia Literary Award. It was shortlisted for the 2011 International Dublin Literary Award. Kingsolver won the 2010 Women's Prize for Fiction for the novel.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe novel tells the story of Harrison William Shepherd beginning with his childhood in Mexico during the 1930s. His parents are separated so he lives back and forth between the United States with his father and Mexico with his mother. During his time in Mexico he works as a plaster mixer for the mural artist Diego Rivera then as a cook for both him and his artist wife Frida Kahlo, with whom Shepherd develops a lifelong friendship. While living with and working for them, he also begins working as a secretary for Leon Trotsky who is hiding there, exiled by Stalin, and witnesses his assassination.\nHe accompanies some of Kahlo's paintings to Washington DC where he witnesses the shootings of the Bonus Army. He then moves to Asheville, North Carolina, where he writes successful historical novels set in Mexico. However he is investigated by the House Un-American Activities Committee, and after he is vilified by the press he returns to Mexico, taking his secretary, Violet Brown, with him. He disappears while swimming off the Pacific coast and is presumed dead. However Brown, the chief beneficiary of his will, later receives a letter from Kahlo hinting that he has survived, by swimming underwater along a lava tube which emerges inland in a cenote.\nHe had instructed Brown to burn his diaries and letterspapers, but she secretly saves them and it is these papers that form the bulk of the novel. There are gaps, or lacunae, in the story, hence the title.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAccording to Book Marks, the book received a \"mixed\" consensus, based on thirteen critic reviews: three \"rave\", four \"positive\", four \"mixed\", and two \"pan\". On The Omnivore, a British aggregator of press reviews, the book received an \"omniscore\" of 3.5 out of 5. Culture Critic assessed critical response as an aggregated score of 85% based on an accumulation of British and American press reviews. The book received a 75% from The Lit Review based on thirty-three critic reviews. On September/October 2010 issue of Bookmarks, the book received a  (4.0 out of 5) based on critic reviews with a summary saying, \"However, the novel's compelling, engrossing story certainly outweighed these minor complaints, and in the end, Kingsolver has created a convincing \"tableau vivant of epochs and people that time has transformed almost past recognition\" (New York Times Book Review)\".\n\n\n== References ==\nFlight Behavior is a 2012 novel by Barbara Kingsolver. It is her seventh novel, a New York Times bestseller, and was declared \"Best book of the year\" by the Washington Post and USA Today.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\nDellarobia Turnbow is a 28-year-old discontented housewife living with her poor family on a farm in Appalachia. On a hike to begin an affair with a telephone repairman, Turnbow finds millions of monarch butterflies in the valley behind her home.\nAs the news of her discovery spreads, university professor Ovid Byron arrives to study the monarchs, and warns that although they are beautiful, they are a disturbing symptom of global climate change, displaced from their established winter habitat in Mexico, and that they may not survive the harsh Tennessee winter.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nAccording to Book Marks, the book received a \"positive\" consensus, based on fourteen critic reviews: five \"rave\", five \"positive\", one \"mixed\", and three \"pan\". On The Omnivore, a British aggregator of press reviews, the book received an \"omniscore\" of 3.5 out of 5. Culture Critic assessed critical response as an aggregated score of 88% based on an accumulation of British and American press reviews. On January/February 2013 issue of Bookmarks, the book received a  (3.5 out of 5) based on critic reviews with a summary saying, \"Although a hot-button issue is never far from center stage here, readers who enjoy settling in with an old pro and spending time with likable, realistically flawed characters will again find an able guide in Kingsolver\".\n\nWriting in UK Sunday newspaper The Observer, Robin McKie found, \"In general, Flight Behaviour is an impressive work. It is complex, elliptical and well-observed. Dellarobia and her kin come over as solid but believable individuals, outlined with respect and balance. Even Cub, her much put-upon simpleton of a husband, and his dreadful, manipulative mother Hester, are ultimately accorded sympathy\". McKie was less impressed with Kingsolver's portrayal, \"almost to the point of overkill\", of the Turnbow family's poverty. \"However\", he added, \"it is the issue of climate change that hangs, unspoken, over proceedings\", and concluded by saying, \"[...] Kingsolver makes her message clear. If only a few more scientists started screaming on TV and radio then we might have a chance to avoid the worst of the calamities that lie ahead\".\nIn The Daily Telegraph, Beth Jones noted that, \"Kingsolver has carved a career from examining social issues in her novels, from economic inequality to racism. In Flight Behaviour, it's the causes and consequences of climate change that form the novel's core. As lepidopterist Ovid Bryon shouts: 'For God's sake\u2026 the damn globe is catching fire and the islands are drowning. The evidence is staring [you] in the face'\". Jones found that, \"[...] in Flight Behaviour she once again manages to make a global crisis seem relevant through tiny domestic details\", before concluding that, \"The result is a compelling plot with lyrical passages and flashes of humour. Absorbing and entertaining, Flight Behaviour engages the reader in the quotidian details of Dellarobia's life, while insisting that we never forget the crumbling world beneath her, and our, feet\".\n\nReviewing the book in The New York Times, Dominique Browning wrote of \"the intricate tapestry of Barbara Kingsolver's majestic and brave new novel\", adding, \"Her subject is both intimate and enormous, centered on one woman, one family, one small town no one has ever heard of \u2014 until Dellarobia stumbles into a life-altering journey of conscience. How do we live, Kingsolver asks, and with what consequences, as we hurtle toward the abyss in these times of epic planetary transformation? And make no mistake about it, the stakes are that high. Postapocalyptic times, and their singular preoccupation with survival, look easy compared with this journey to the end game. Yet we must also deal with the pinching boots of everyday life.

The father of the family creates his own \"misprint\" of the Bible. He concludes his sermons with the Kikongo expression \"Tata Jesus is b\u00e4ngala\" with the intent of saying \"Jesus is most precious\". In his hurried mispronunciation, he actually says \"Jesus is poisonwood\".\n\n\n== Plot ==\nOrleanna Price, the mother of the family, narrates the introductory chapter in five of the novel's seven sections. The narrative then alternates among the four daughters, with a slight preference for the voice of the most conflicted one, Leah. The four girls increasingly mature and develop differently as each adapts to African village life and the political turmoil that overtakes the Belgian Congo in the 1960s.\nThe Price family packs up their belongings for their flight to the Congo, where they are going to spend a year as the family of a missionary. However, shortly before leaving, they are informed that they are limited to 44 pounds of luggage per person. The Southern Baptist Mission League suggests they solve this problem by leaving for the airport wearing many layers of clothing, hiding household items among the layers of clothes to lighten their luggage.\nThe Price daughters \u2013 Rachel, Leah, Adah and Ruth May \u2013 and their mother, Orleanna, and father, Nathan, attend their first church service in the village of Kilanga, and they realize how different their culture is from that of the Congo. For example, 14-year-old Leah helps her father plant a \"demonstration garden\"; it immediately receives criticism from Mama Tataba, whom the family has engaged as a live-in maid, and the garden does poorly due to the inappropriate climate. Nathan tries to hold an impromptu Easter celebration in hopes of baptizing numerous people, but he is unable to carry this out, as the river along the village, where he plans to hold the baptism, is infested with crocodiles.\nLeah and her twin Adah begin to spy on Eeben Axelroot, the pilot who conveyed the family to Kilanga, and Nathan tries to convince Congolese men, one by one, to convert to Christianity. Meanwhile, five-year-old Ruth May befriends the village children. She finds out about Axelroot's business with the diamonds after breaking her arm.\nAfter Mama Tataba departs, an orphan boy named Nelson becomes the family servant. Nathan and Leah go to Leopoldville (present day Kinshasa) to witness what is going on with the independence in the Congo. Methuselah (a parrot the Prices adopted from the previous missionary) dies, and Adah finds his feathers. Ruth May becomes very sick and lies in bed for the majority of the day. Leah begins to spend a lot of time with Anatole, Kilanga's teacher, discussing topics such as justice and the Congo. Leah wants to participate in the hunt, which upsets the village elders, as it would go against their custom, but she eventually is allowed to participate and even hunts an antelope.\nThe girls all gather together in the morning to check out the chicken coop. Inside they find footprints and a green mamba snake. A scream and gasp is heard from Ruth May, who has been bitten by the snake. The girls watch her turn cold and blue before she dies. Orleanna becomes filled with guilt over Ruth May's death, and takes the other children away, leaving her arrogant husband to fend for himself. With Anatole's help, they eventually reach safety.\nThe remaining Price sisters go through many different life changes: Adah dedicates herself to getting a scientific education back home (she is hemiplegic and wants to learn more about the condition); Leah marries Anatole and they start a family together; Rachel remains perceptive but vain and distrustful of men, goes through a string of marriages, and starts a business; and Nathan dies in his un\nThe Bean Trees is the first novel by American writer Barbara Kingsolver. It was published in 1988 and reissued in 1998. The novel is followed by the sequel Pigs in Heaven.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\nTaylor Greer sets out to leave home, Kentucky, and travel west, and finds herself in Oklahoma near Cherokee territory. As Taylor stops in the town, a woman suddenly approaches, deposits a small child, and leaves without explanation. Not knowing what else to do, Taylor decides to care for the child. The two travel to Tucson, Arizona, where she meets Lou Ann, a woman with a young son. Lou Ann had been married; her husband abandoned her and their child.\nThe novel traces the experiences of Taylor and the child, whom Taylor names Turtle.\n\n\n== Setting ==\nThe story takes place in real places in North America, including Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Arizona. It begins when the main character, Taylor, leaves her home in Pittman, Kentucky to find herself. First, her car breaks down in the middle of Oklahoma, later in Tucson, Arizona. She travels back to Oklahoma and again to Arizona because of the people she became close with throughout the novel.\nBarbara Kingsolver's interest in nature is reflected in the Bean Trees, as it is full of descriptive landscapes and characters' passion towards the environment. The author uses history and biology to describe certain events or world issues related to nature.\n\n\n== Characters ==\nTaylor Greer, a native of Kentucky, is the protagonist and narrator of the novel. She is also known by her given name Marietta and nickname Missy. Taylor's personality is described as tough, adventurous, and independent throughout the novel.\nTurtle is the three-year-old child who is left with Taylor in Oklahoma.\nLou Ann lives in Tucson and has a baby named Dwayne Ray. She is also originally from Kentucky and is Taylor's roommate.\nEsperanza and Estevan are Guatemalan refugees that Taylor meets in Arizona.\nMattie is the owner of \"Jesus is Lord Used Tires.\" She grows vegetables and beans in her garden, which is filled with tire parts. Her home is a place where undocumented immigrants stay.\n\n\n== Major themes ==\nThe Bean Trees is a coming-of-age novel.\nBarbara Kingsolver uses a nonstandard perspective to share the characters' adventures and the world they live in. The use of nonwhite mythology, anti-western sentiment, and not using the typical form of male adventure, allowed the author to explore the world where women were powerful and had a voice.\nThe novel shares negative traumatic experiences of the characters and people they meet, like Native Americans and Guatemalan refugees. While those scenes demonstrate qualities like sympathy and concern, they contribute to the overall spirit of the story being positive and uplifting.\nThe protagonist is raised by a single mother, which helps to develop themes of motherhood and nontraditional family values throughout the story, as Taylor, herself becomes Turtle's parent. The novel further explores nontraditional extended family through the relationships between the members of the community. It conveys the idea of interdependence and interaction, community's importance to each individual's life, and balance between independence and a sense of belonging. It also addresses the issue of parenthood through adoption. The novel makes reference to the issue of Native American parental rights as well.\nThe Bean Trees also portrays the effects of child abuse.\nIt portrays undocumented immigration from Latin America as some characters facilitate immigrants' escape from persecution.\nThemes of love and nurturing emerge from the violence and poverty that the characters face. The book conveys multiple symbolic meanings about shared motherhood, life and death, and beauty. The underlying themes not always recognized include those about mockery toward the judicial system, the flawed coping strategies of current-day issues, and the strength of friendship.\n\n\n== Style ==\nJack Butler wrote for the New York Times, \"The Bean Trees is\nProdigal Summer (2000) is the fifth novel by American author Barbara Kingsolver.  Heavily emphasizing ecological themes and her trademark interweaving plots, this novel tells three stories of love, loss and connections in rural Virginia.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nProdigal Summer tells the story of a small town in Appalachia during a single, humid summer, when three interweaving stories of love, loss and family unfold against the backdrop of the lush wildness of Virginia mountains. The narrative follows Deanna, a solitary woman working as a park ranger; Lusa, a recently widowed entomologist at odds with her late farmer husband's tight-knit family; and Garnett, an old man who dreams of restoring the lineage of the extinct American Chestnut tree.\nKingsolver's extensive education in biology is on display in this book, laden with ecological concepts and biological facts. Her writing also exhibits her knowledge of rural Virginia, where she has lived for decades. In the acknowledgments Kingsolver thanks her Virginia friends and neighbors, as well as Fred Herbard of the American Chestnut Foundation.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Daily Telegraph reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the novel out of \"Love It\", \"Pretty Good\", \"Ok\", and \"Rubbish\": Daily Telegraph,  Independent, Sunday Telegraph, and New Statesman reviews under \"Love It\" and Guardian, Times, and Sunday Times reviews under \"Pretty Good\" and Literary Review and TLS reviews under \"Ok\".\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nProdigal Summer at the author's official site\nNew York Times review of Prodigal Summer\nScience & Film interview about film adaptation of Prodigal Summer\nAnimal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life (2007) is a non-fiction book by Barbara Kingsolver detailing her family's attempt to eat only locally grown food for an entire year.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe book revolves around the concept of improving the family's diet by eating only foods that her family was able to grow themselves or obtain locally (save for grains and olive oil). Kingsolver, along with her husband and daughters, start a farm in Virginia where they grow and can different varieties of tomatoes, learn about rooster husbandry, make cheese, and adjust to eating foods only when they are locally in season. The book contrasts this with the ecological costs of growing food in factory farms, transporting it thousands of miles, and adding chemical preservatives so it will not spoil.\nA book excerpt in the May/June 2007 issue of Mother Jones magazine is available online.  An audio recording of a May 16, 2007 discussion between Kingsolver and her husband at an hour-long bookstore presentation in Corte Madera, California is also available.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nOn September/October 2007 issue of Bookmarks, the book received a  (4.0 out of 5) based on critic reviews with a summary saying, \"Their combined efforts resulted in nearly universal praise from the critics\".\nTime magazine's Lev Grossman named it one of the Top 10 Nonfiction Books of 2007, ranking it at #7.  Rick Bass wrote in The Boston Globe that \"this text will fold quietly into the reader's consciousness, with affecting grace and dignity, because of its prose and sensibilities.\" Bass also said that \"Kingsolver is no pious soapboxer, but instead explores these ideas with enthusiasm and the awe of discovery.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nLocavore\nLocal food\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAnimal, Vegetable, Miracle official website\nGood Eatin' Barbara Kingsolver grows her own, the Boston Phoenix\nAnimal Dreams is a 1990 novel by Barbara Kingsolver. A woman named Cosima \"Codi\" Noline returns to her hometown of Grace, Arizona to help her aging father, who is slowly losing his struggle with Alzheimer's disease. She takes a biology teacher position at the local high school and lives with her old high school friend, Emelina. Animal Dreams features Kingsolver's trademark\u2014alternating perspectives throughout the novel. Most chapters are told from the perspective of Codi, while others are told from her father, Homer's, perspective. The book was dedicated to Ben Linder, who was killed by the Contras on April 28, 1987.\nThe novel features some Hispanic and Native American themes.  Codi's sister, Halimeda \"Hallie\", moves to Nicaragua to teach local people more sustainable farming techniques. Another political theme in the novel is the small town's fight against the Black Mountain Mining Company, which pollutes the river water and nearly destroys the citizens' orchard trees, Grace's primary economic livelihood.\nIn addition to political themes like these, many of Kingsolver's novels also feature images and themes from biology. Animal Dreams is rich with natural imagery and the study of the created world. And, as with most Kingsolver novels, this one is laced with genial humor.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nWriting in the New York Times Jane Smiley has some reservations about the novel \"Ms. Kingsolver has chosen to explore Codi's despair, and in doing so she frequently undermines the suspense and the weight of her book. First-person narration can be tricky, and Ms. Kingsolver falls into its trap: Codi comes across too often as a whiner, observant of others but invariably more concerned with her own state of mind.\" Smiley concludes that Kingsolver \"demonstrates a special gift for the vivid evocation of landscape and of her characters' state of mind. That she leaves open spaces, that she doesn't quite integrate everything into a perfect system, is probably to her credit.\"\nKirkus Reviews says \"Kingsolver has political conviction, a wonderful eye for the surface of things and many charming poetic conceits,\nbut here her characters seem constructed rather than real. A promising miss.\"\nMargaret Randall of the Los Angeles Times is positive \"As I read the last few pages of Animal Dreams, I felt a brief moment of panic. Would this book really end as it seemed it was going to? Suddenly the outcome I had hoped for unwound before my grateful eyes. Things happened as I wanted them to, as I breathed a sigh of relief. This neat wrap-up may be the single flaw in an otherwise exceptionally crafted narrative. Most important for me, however, is my conviction that Kingsolver is giving a new voice to our literature, one that fulfills its promise even as it begins its journey: four books in as many years.\"\n\n\n== Awards ==\nPen/USA West Fiction Award\nEdward Abbey Award for Ecofiction\nNamed an American Library Association Notable Book, the Arizona Library Association Book of the Year, and a New York Times Notable Book.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nAnimal Dreams on Barbara Kingsolver's website Archived 2018-04-06 at the Wayback Machine\nAnimal Dreams book\nUnsheltered is a 2018 novel by Barbara Kingsolver published by HarperCollins.

Ilana Masad states in her NPR review that by the end of the novel \"Kingsolver doesn't give us solutions, but she reminds us to take comfort in one another when we can, and that hope is necessary even when all seems lost.\" Benjamin Evans' review in The Guardian notes, \"Unlike the incompetent architect of the house in her latest book, Unsheltered, American novelist Barbara Kingsolver has proved herself a supreme craftsperson over the past three decades. She possesses a knack for ingenious metaphors that encapsulate the social questions at the heart of her stories.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Unsheltered\" at Barbara Kingsolver's authorized website\nThe Pulitzer Prize for Fiction is one of the seven American Pulitzer Prizes that are annually awarded for Letters, Drama, and Music. It recognizes distinguished fiction by an American author, preferably dealing with American life, published during the preceding calendar year. \nAs the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel (awarded 1918\u20131947), it was one of the original Pulitzers; the program was inaugurated in 1917 with seven prizes, four of which were awarded that year  (no Novel prize was awarded in 1917, the first one having been granted in 1918).\nThe name was changed to the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1948, and eligibility was expanded to also include short stories, novellas, novelettes, and poetry, as well as novels.\nFinalists have been announced since 1980, usually a total of three.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nAs defined in the original Plan of Award, the prize was given \"Annually, for the American novel published during the year which shall best present the wholesome atmosphere of American life, and the highest standard of American manners and manhood,\" although there was some struggle over whether the word wholesome should be used instead of whole, the word Pulitzer had written in his will. In 1927, the advisory board quietly instituted Pulitzer's word choice, replacing wholesome with whole.\nWith 1929 came the first of several much more substantive changes. The board changed the wording to \"preferably one which shall best present the whole atmosphere of American life\" and deleted the insistence that the novel portray \"the highest standard of American manners and manhood\". In 1936, emphasis was changed again, with the award going to \"a distinguished novel published during the year by an American author, preferably dealing with American life\". In 1948, the advisory board widened the scope of the award with the wording \"For distinguished fiction published in book form during the year by an American author, preferably dealing with American life.\" This change allowed the prize to go to a collection of short stories for the first time, James Michener's Tales of the South Pacific.\n\n\n== Winners ==\nIn 31 years under the \"Novel\" name, the prize was awarded 27 times; in its first 76 years to 2023 under the \"Fiction\" name, 69 times. There have been 11 years during which no title received the award. It was shared by two authors for the first time in 2023. Since this category's inception in 1918, 31 women have won the prize.

The band took its self-mocking name from the publishing term \"remaindered book\", a term for books that are no longer selling well and whose remaining unsold copies are liquidated by the publisher at greatly reduced prices. Their performances collectively raised $2 million for charity from their concerts.\nBand members included Dave Barry, Stephen King, Amy Tan, Sam Barry, Ridley Pearson, Scott Turow, Joel Selvin, James McBride, Mitch Albom, Roy Blount Jr., Barbara Kingsolver, Robert Fulghum, Matt Groening, Tad Bartimus, Greg Iles, Aron Ralston and honorary member Maya Angelou among others, as well as professional musicians such as multi-instrumentalist (and author) Al Kooper, drummer Josh Kelly, guitarist Roger McGuinn and saxophonist Erasmo Paulo. Founder Kathi Kamen Goldmark died on May 24, 2012, and the group disbanded a month later, following a memorial concert in her honor.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Remainders was founded by Kathi Kamen Goldmark in 1992. Goldmark was then a musician whose day job was in book publicity. Through this, she met many prolific authors. One day while driving one of the authors around, she hit upon the idea of starting a band with them. It stuck. The Remainders' first performance was in 1992 at the American Booksellers Association convention in Anaheim, California. A review of the concert in The Washington Post referred to it as \"the most heavily promoted musical debut since The Monkees.\"\nIn his memoir On Writing, Stephen King described the Remainders' performances as energetic if sloppy due to the limited music skill of himself and some other writers, and perhaps reminiscent of a bar band when augmented by a few professional musicians.: '...with a couple of \u201cringer\u201d musicians on sax and drums (plus, in the early days, our musical guru, Al Kooper, at the heart of the group), we sounded pretty good. You\u2019d pay to hear us. Not a lot, not U2 or E Street Band prices, but maybe what the oldtimers call \u201croadhouse money.\"' Dave Barry later joked \"We played music by what I call the Rumor Method, wherein from time to time an alarming rumor went around the band: There might have been a chord change. This prompted everybody to change to a new chord. Although not necessarily the same new chord.\"\nThe Remainders also played at the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1995.\nIn April 2010, they began the Wordstock Tour presented by the Pearson Foundation and We Give Books, benefiting the children and schools of Haiti.\nThe Remainders gave their last concert on June 23, 2012, at the annual conference of the American Library Association in Anaheim, where they played their first concert 20 years before. The event, co-sponsored by ProQuest, raised money for library and information science scholarships.\nThe Remainders last performed together on the August 6, 2012, episode of The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, on which both Stephen King and Dave Barry were guests (although the segment was taped in June 2012 when the band was in town for the ALA concert).\nIn September 2014, it was announced that the Remainders would reunite to perform at the  Tucson Festival of Books in March 2015. On March 15, 2015, the band's reunion was referenced in Merl Reagle's syndicated Sunday crossword puzzle. Titled \"Book Notes,\" the crossword included the band's name and several puns using names of writers who were members.\n\n\n== Concerts ==\n1992, Anaheim: American Booksellers Association convention\n1993, various cities: the 'Three Chords and an Attitude' tour \u2013 6 dates on the US East Coast\n1995, Cleveland: the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (opening)\nA version of the band with Barry and Albom and Ridley Pearson and Warren Zevon also played at the Miami Book Fair in 1997\n2010 New York City at the Nokia Theater in Times Square (April 23, 2010)\n2012, A\nThe Women's Prize for Fiction (previously called Orange Prize for Fiction (1996\u20132006 & 2009\u201312), Orange Broadband Prize for Fiction (2007\u20132008) and Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction (2014\u20132017)) is one of the United Kingdom's most prestigious literary prizes, annually awarded to a female author of any nationality for the best original full-length novel written in English, and published in the United Kingdom in the preceding year. The prize was originally due to be launched in 1994 with the support of Mitsubishi but public controversy over the merits of the award caused the sponsorship to be withdrawn. Funding from Orange, a UK mobile network operator and Internet service provider, allowed the prize to be launched in 1996 by a committee of male and female \"journalists, reviewers, agents, publishers, librarians, booksellers\", including current Honorary Director Kate Mosse.\nIn May 2012, it was announced that Orange would be ending its sponsorship of the prize. In 2012, the award was formally known as the \"Women's Prize for Fiction\", and was sponsored by \"private benefactors\" led by Cherie Blair and writers Joanna Trollope and Elizabeth Buchan. In 2013, the new sponsor became Baileys. In January 2017 the company announced that it was the last year that they would sponsor the prize. In June 2017, the prize announced it would change its name to simply \"Women's Prize for Fiction\" starting in 2018, and will be supported by a family of sponsors.\nThe prize was established to recognise the contribution of female writers, whom Mosse believed were often overlooked in other major literary awards, and in reaction to the all-male shortlist for the 1991 Booker Prize. The winner of the prize receives \u00a330,000, along with a bronze sculpture called the Bessie created by artist Grizel Niven, the sister of actor and writer David Niven. Typically, a longlist of nominees is announced around March each year, followed by a shortlist in June; within days the winner is announced. The winner is selected by a board of \"five leading women\" each year. In 2005, judges named Andrea Levy's Small Island as the \"Orange of Oranges\", the best novel of the preceding decade.\nThe BBC suggests that the prize forms part of the \"trinity\" of UK literary prizes, along with the Booker Prize and the Costa Book Awards; the sales of works by the nominees of these awards are significantly boosted. Levy's 2004 winning book sold almost one million copies (in comparison to less than 600,000 for the Booker Prize winner of the same year), while sales of Helen Dunmore's A Spell of Winter quadrupled after being awarded the inaugural prize. Valerie Martin's 2003 award saw her novel sales increase tenfold after the award, and British libraries, who often support the prize with various promotions, reported success in introducing people to new authors: \"48% said that they had tried new writers as a result of the promotion, and 42% said that they would try other books by the new authors they had read.\"\nHowever, the fact that the prize singles out female writers is not without controversy. After the prize was founded, Auberon Waugh nicknamed it the \"Lemon Prize\" while Germaine Greer claimed there would soon be a prize for \"writers with red hair\". Winner of the 1990 Booker Prize, A. S. Byatt, called it a \"sexist prize\", claiming \"such a prize was never needed.\" In 1999, the chairwoman of the judges, Lola Young, said that the British fiction they were asked to appraise fell into two categories, either \"insular and parochial\" or \"domestic in a piddling kind of way\", unlike American authors who \"take small, intimate stories and set them against this vast physical and cultural landscape which is very appealing.\" Linda Grant suffered accusations of plagiarism following her award in 2000, while the following year, a panel of male critics produced their own shortlist and heavily criticised the genuine shortlist. Though full of praise for the winner of the 2007 prize, the chair of the judging panel M\nPigs in Heaven (ISBN 9780060168018) is a 1993 novel by Barbara Kingsolver; it is the sequel to her first novel, The Bean Trees.  It continues the story of Taylor Greer and Turtle, her adopted Cherokee daughter. It highlights the strong relationships between mothers and daughters, with special attention given to the customs, history, and present living situation of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma. It is Kingsolver's first book to appear on the New York Times Best Seller list.\nThe New York Times Book Review praised Kingsolver's \"extravagantly gifted narrative voice\" and called the novel a \"resounding achievement\".\n\n\n== References ==\nLee County is the westernmost county in the U.S. Commonwealth of Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 22,173. Its county seat is Jonesville.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area of far western Virginia and eastern Kentucky supported large Archaic Native American populations. The first known Europeans to enter what is present-day Lee County were a party of Spanish explorers, Juan de Villalobos and Francisco de Silvera, sent by Hernando de Soto in 1540, in search of gold. The county was formed after the American Revolutionary War in 1792 from Russell County. It was named for Light Horse Harry Lee, the Governor of Virginia from 1791 to 1794, who was famous for his exploits as a leader of light cavalry during the war. He was the father of Robert E. Lee, later a West Point graduate and career US Army officer who became the General in Chief of the Armies of the Confederate States during the American Civil War.\nLee County was the final front on the Kentucky Trace, now known as the Wilderness Road and The Trail of the Lonesome Pine. During the 1780s and 1790s, fortified buildings called \"stations\" were built along the trail for shelter from Indian raids as the settlers followed Daniel Boone's path into the Kentucky frontier. The stations in Lee County were Yoakum Station at present-day Dryden, west to Powell River and Station Creek at today's Rocky Station, then to Mump's Fort at Jonesville, followed by Prist Station, Martin's Station at Rose Hill, Chadwell Station at Chadwell Gap, Owen Station at Ewing, and finally Gibson Station, which still bears its original name. One of the largest early landowners was Revolutionary War officer and explorer Joseph Martin, after whom Martin's Station and Martin's Creek at Rose Hill are named. Due to his rank of command, Martin had been awarded some 25,000 acres (100 km2) in a land grant after the war. He divided the land and sold it as a speculator. Rose Hill was established in 1832 as the first federally recognized post office in Lee County. In 1814, parts of Lee, Russell, and Washington counties were combined to form Scott County. In 1856, parts of Lee, Russell, and Scott counties were combined to form Wise County, named after the last governor of Virginia before the Civil War.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe economy of Lee County has been based largely on growing tobacco and mining coal. The decline of both has resulted in high unemployment in the county and a decrease in population since 1940, which was the peak. Using the slogan Where Virginia Begins, the county has attempted to increase its heritage tourism industry by emphasizing its role in the route used by settlers going west through the Cumberland Gap, at Lee County's western tip. Lee County shares Cumberland Gap National Historical Park with Kentucky and Tennessee. Attractions listed in the park include Hensley's Settlement, the Pinnacle Overlook, the Sand Cave, and the White Rocks overlooking the towns of Ewing and Rose Hill in Virginia. Lee County is a dry county for hard liquor, although retail sales are permitted.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 437 square miles (1,130 km2), of which 436 square miles (1,130 km2) is land and 1.9 square miles (4.9 km2) (0.4%) is water. Lee County is one of the 423 counties served by the Appalachian Regional Commission, and it is identified as part of \"Greater Appalachia\" by Colin Woodard in his book American Nations: A History of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures of North America.\nAll of Lee County lies longitudinally west of West Virginia. The entirety of Lee County is physically closer to eight state capitals other than its own capital in Richmond: Raleigh, North Carolina; Columbia, South Carolina; Atlanta, Georgia; Nashville, Tennessee; Charleston, West Virginia; Frankfort, Kentucky; Columbus, Ohio; and Indianapolis, Indiana. Additionally, the far western part of Lee County\u2013including Wheeler and the Cumberland Gap, roughly 350 miles (560 km) from Rich\nThe Big Read was a survey on books carried out by the BBC in the United Kingdom in 2003, where over three-quarters of a million votes were received from the British public to find the nation's best-loved novel. The year-long survey was the biggest single test of public reading taste to date, and culminated with several programmes hosted by celebrities, advocating their favourite books.\n\n\n== Purpose ==\nThe BBC started the Big Read with the goal of finding the \"Nation's Best-loved Novel\" by way of a viewer vote via the Web, SMS, and telephone. The show attracted controversy for adopting an allegedly sensationalist approach to literature, but supporters praised it for raising the public awareness of reading. The British public voted originally for any novel that they wished. From this, a list of 200 was drawn up, with the highest 21 then put forward for further voting, on the provision that only one book per author was permitted in the top 21. As the poll was based on novels, the plays of William Shakespeare were not part of the survey.\n\n\n== Top 200 novels in the United Kingdom ==\n\n\n== Authors with multiple novels on the list ==\nMultiple novels in the Top 25\nIn the first stage, all four extant Harry Potter novels by J. K. Rowling were among the 25 leaders. So were both Middle-earth novels by J. R. R. Tolkien. The second stage featured 21 books by distinct authors: the top 25 with Rowling represented only by her fourth volume, Goblet of Fire, and Tolkien only by The Lord of the Rings. Those two novels finally placed fifth and first; the other preliminary leaders by Rowling and Tolkien nominally led the also-rans in ranks 22\u201325.\n\nMultiple novels in the Top 50\nFour: J. K.

He has also written numerous books of humor and parody, as well as comic novels and children's novels. Barry's honors include the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary (1988) and the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism (2005).\nBarry has defined a sense of humor as \"a measurement of the extent to which we realize that we are trapped in a world almost totally devoid of reason. Laughter is how we express the anxiety we feel at this knowledge.\"\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBarry was born in Armonk, New York, where his father, David W. Barry, was a Presbyterian minister. He was educated at Wampus Elementary School, Harold C. Crittenden Junior High School (both in Armonk), and Pleasantville High School, where he was elected \"Class Clown\" in 1965. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from Haverford College in 1969.\nAs an alumnus of a Quaker-affiliated college, he avoided military service during the Vietnam War by registering as a religious conscientious objector. Barry decided \"early on\" that he was an atheist. He said, \"The problem with writing about religion is that you run the risk of offending sincerely religious people, and then they come after you with machetes.\"\n\n\n== Writing career ==\nBarry began his journalism career in 1971, working as a general-assignment reporter for the Daily Local News in West Chester, Pennsylvania, near his alma mater, Haverford College. He covered local government and civic events and was promoted to City Editor after about two years. He also started writing a weekly humor column for the paper and began to develop his unique style. He remained at the newspaper through 1974. He then worked briefly as a copy editor at the Associated Press's Philadelphia bureau before joining Burger Associates, a consulting firm.\nAt Burger, he taught effective writing to businesspeople. In his own words, he \"spent nearly eight years trying to get various businesspersons to...stop writing things like 'Enclosed please find the enclosed enclosures,' but...eventually realized that it was hopeless.\"\nIn 1981 he wrote a humorous guest column in The Philadelphia Inquirer about watching the birth of his son, which attracted the attention of Gene Weingarten, then an editor of the Miami Herald's Sunday magazine Tropic. Weingarten hired Barry as a humor columnist in 1983. Barry's column was syndicated nationally. Barry won a Pulitzer Prize for Commentary in 1988 for \"his consistently effective use of humor as a device for presenting fresh insights into serious concerns.\"\nBarry's first novel, Big Trouble, was published in 1999. The book was adapted into a motion picture directed by Barry Sonnenfeld and starring Tim Allen, Rene Russo, and Patrick Warburton, with a cameo by Barry (deleted in post-production). The movie was originally due for release in September 2001 but was postponed following the September 11, 2001, attacks because the story involved terrorists smuggling a nuclear weapon onto an airplane. The film was released in April 2002.\nIn response to a column in which Barry mocked the cities of Grand Forks, North Dakota, and East Grand Forks, Minnesota, for calling themselves the \"Grand Cities\", Grand Forks named a sewage pumping station after Barry in January 2002. Barry traveled to Grand Forks for the dedication ceremony.\nArticles written by Barry have appeared in publications such as Boating, Home Office Computing, and Reader's Digest, in addition to the Chicken Soup for the Soul inspirational book series. Two of his articles have been included in The Best American Sports Writing series. One of his columns was used as the introduction to the book Pirattitude!: So You Wanna Be a Pirate? Here's How! (ISBN 0-451-21649-0), a follow-up to Barry's role in publicizing International Talk Like a Pirate Day. His books have frequently appeared on The New\nTrust is a 2022 novel written by Hernan Diaz. The novel was published by Riverhead Books.\nSet predominantly in New York City and focusing on the world of finance, the novel is a metafictional look at a secretive financier and his wife. \n\n\n== Summary ==\nThe book is composed of four fictional texts: A Novel (Bonds), an incomplete autobiography (My Life), a completed memoir (A Memoir, Remembered), and a diary (Futures). While each book focuses on many of the same characters, the information included in each is often mutually exclusive, with it being left up to the reader to determine the truth.\n\n\n=== Bonds ===\nBenjamin Rask is a prosperous American financier from a family of merchants-turned-financiers. In his middle age, Benjamin meets the much younger Helen, a prodigy who has spent most of her life in Europe. The two marry, and while they are not in love, they share a mutual respect. Helen begins to spend most of her money on supporting musical artists. During the Wall Street crash of 1929, the Rask fortune remains unscathed. Numerous friends believe that Rask manipulated the market and turn on the Rasks. Helen descends into madness and eczema and retires to the same Swiss sanatorium where her mentally ill father spent his last days. Impatient with her progress, Benjamin allows her to undergo convulsive therapy, which kills her.\n\n\n=== My Life ===\nAndrew Bevel, an American financier, begins to write his autobiography as a rebuttal to 'Bonds,' which he claims is a thinly veiled yet slanderous account of his own life. My Life focuses on his family of financiers, citing two tenets as guiding principles: making their own conditions for success and conflating personal gain with public virtue. He credits his marriage to Mildred, an even-tempered woman, to much of his success and describes how she saved him small ways in which she helped make his home more domestic. Mildred is eventually diagnosed with cancer and dies. Further into the text the writing becomes degraded, with editorial notes to eventually return and expand the text.\n\n\n=== A Memoir, Remembered ===\nIda Partenza reveals that at 23, with her Italian anarchist-typesetter father no longer able to financially support them, she underwent a series of bizarre interviews that led her to become Andrew Bevel's ghostwriter. Bevel was infuriated by Harold Vanner\u2019s hit novel Bonds, which was clearly based on the Bevels\u2019 lives, and sought to restore his deceased wife Mildred\u2019s image.  \nIda takes the job but becomes increasingly intrigued by Mildred, whom Bevel describes in demeaning terms but who was clearly an incredibly intelligent and sophisticated woman. Before the memoir is finished, Bevel dies, and Ida goes on to become a secretary and later a novelist. In her 70s, researching Mildred at Bevel's mansion, now a museum, she discovers an uncatalogued diary belonging to Mildred and steals it.\n\n\n=== Futures ===\nMildred Bevel, confined to a Swiss sanatorium, details her last days before cancer takes her. In her notes, Mildred emerges as a much sharper, shrewd, and forward-looking woman than Harold Vanner\u2019s reclusive Helen or Andrew Bevel\u2019s delicate, childlike specter. Certain heretofore unshared details in Mildred\u2019s life that were replicated in Bonds, coupled with Mildred's admission she regularly corresponded with Vanner, imply that he either obtained the information directly from her or that Mildred even helped write Bonds herself. \nNot merely a philanthropist, Mildred confesses how her husband initially gave her a small sum with which to play the stock market and did better than his own to the point that she could have formed her own enterprise. It is also revealed that finance was both an intellectual exercise and a source of great ambition and \u201ca dark fuel\u201d for Mildred, whereas Andrew was obsessed with the outcome. The two began to collaborate with Andrew filling a forward-facing role, lauded for his \u201cintuition,\u201d while Mildred designed mathematical models and made decisions, but bo\nMademoiselle was a women's magazine first published in 1935 by Street & Smith and later acquired by Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications.\nMademoiselle, primarily a fashion magazine, was also known for publishing short stories by popular authors including Truman Capote, Joyce Carol Oates, William Faulkner, Tennessee Williams, James Baldwin, Flannery O'Connor, Sylvia Plath, Paul Bowles, Jane Bowles, Jane Smiley, Mary Gordon, Paul Theroux, Sue Miller, Barbara Kingsolver, Perri Klass, Michael Chabon, Mona Simpson, Alice Munro, Harold Brodkey, Pam Houston, Jean Stafford, and Susan Minot. Julia Cameron was a frequent columnist. The art director was Barbara Kruger, then it was Cipe Pineles who became it from 1961.\nIn 1952, Sylvia Plath's short story \"Sunday at the Mintons\" won first prize and $500, as well as publication in the magazine. Her experiences during the summer of 1953 as a guest editor at Mademoiselle provided the basis for her novel, The Bell Jar.\nThe August 1961 \"college issue\" of Mademoiselle included a photo of UCLA senior class president Willette Murphy, who did not realize she was making history as the first African-American model to appear in a mainstream fashion magazine.\nDuring an interview with Fashion Week Online, Fern Mallis mentioned that she was one of 20 winners of the guest editing competition that she entered while attending college. She stated that she \"was the only one of the 20 asked to come back and get a full-time job with the magazine.\" Mallis attributed that her publishing career began at Mademoiselle. The New York Social Diary stated that she \u201cworked at the magazine for six years.\u201d\nIn the sixties, Mademoiselle was geared toward \"the smart young woman\".  It categorically stated in its editorials that despite the young, maidenly name, it was not geared toward young teenagers. The majority of readers may have been in college or in a job, and some may have been married. Mademoiselle was interested in reaching mature college freshmen and up who were being exposed to the greatest literature and facing the greatest moral problems coping with all the complexities of the atomic age.\nMademoiselle continued throughout the eighties and nineties featuring the top models on its covers and in the pages of the editorial sections.\nIn 1993, Elizabeth Crow was appointed editor-in-chief. The November 2001 magazine was the final issue. Some of the 93 employees and features moved over to Glamour, also published by Cond\u00e9 Nast.    The magazine's demise was due to multiple factors, including an editorial inability to update the magazine to appeal to a sufficient audience and an overall decline in advertising revenues across the magazine industry.\n\n\n== Editors ==\nDesmond Hall and F.

Abels was a managing editor of the magazine from 1950 to the early 1960s.\nMagdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calder\u00f3n (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8f\u027ei\u00f0a \u02c8kalo]; 6 July 1907 \u2013 13 July 1954) was a Mexican painter known for her many portraits, self-portraits, and works inspired by the nature and artifacts of Mexico. Inspired by the country's popular culture, she employed a na\u00efve folk art style to explore questions of identity, postcolonialism, gender, class, and race in Mexican society. Her paintings often had strong autobiographical elements and mixed realism with fantasy. In addition to belonging to the post-revolutionary Mexicayotl movement, which sought to define a Mexican identity, Kahlo has been described as a surrealist or magical realist. She is also known for painting about her experience of chronic pain.\nBorn to a German father and a mestiza mother (of Pur\u00e9pecha descent), Kahlo spent most of her childhood and adult life at La Casa Azul, her family home in Coyoac\u00e1n \u2013 now publicly accessible as the Frida Kahlo Museum. Although she was disabled by polio as a child, Kahlo had been a promising student headed for medical school until being injured in a bus accident at the age of 18, which caused her lifelong pain and medical problems. During her recovery, she returned to her childhood interest in art with the idea of becoming an artist.\nKahlo's interests in politics and art led her to join the Mexican Communist Party in 1927, through which she met fellow Mexican artist Diego Rivera. The couple married in 1929 and spent the late 1920s and early 1930s travelling in Mexico and the United States together. During this time, she developed her artistic style, drawing her main inspiration from Mexican folk culture, and painted mostly small self-portraits that mixed elements from pre-Columbian and Catholic beliefs. Her paintings raised the interest of surrealist artist Andr\u00e9 Breton, who arranged for Kahlo's first solo exhibition at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York in 1938; the exhibition was a success and was followed by another in Paris in 1939. While the French exhibition was less successful, the Louvre purchased a painting from Kahlo, The Frame, making her the first Mexican artist to be featured in their collection. Throughout the 1940s, Kahlo participated in exhibitions in Mexico and the United States and worked as an art teacher. She taught at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado (\"La Esmeralda\") and was a founding member of the Seminario de Cultura Mexicana. Kahlo's always-fragile health began to decline in the same decade. While she had had solo exhibitions elsewhere, she had her first solo exhibition in Mexico in 1953, shortly before her death in 1954 at the age of 47.\nKahlo's work as an artist remained relatively unknown until the late 1970s, when her work was rediscovered by art historians and political activists. By the early 1990s, not only had she become a recognized figure in art history, but she was also regarded as an icon for Chicanos, the feminism movement, and the LGBTQ+ community. Kahlo's work has been celebrated internationally as emblematic of Mexican national and Indigenous traditions and by feminists for what is seen as its uncompromising depiction of the female experience and form.\n\n\n== Artistic career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\n\nKahlo enjoyed art from an early age, receiving drawing instruction from printmaker Fernando Fern\u00e1ndez (who was her father's friend) and filling notebooks with sketches. In 1925, she began to work outside of school to help her family. After briefly working as a stenographer, she became a paid engraving apprentice for Fern\u00e1ndez. He was impressed by her talent, although she did not consider art as a career at this time.\nA severe bus accident at the age of 18 left Kahlo in lifelong pain. Confined to bed for three months following the accident, Kahlo began to paint. She started to consider a career as a medical illustrator, as well, which would combine her interests in science and art. Her mother provided her with a specially-made easel, which enabled\nThe National Humanities Medal is an American award that annually recognizes several individuals, groups, or institutions for work that has \"deepened the nation's understanding of the humanities, broadened our citizens' engagement with the humanities, or helped preserve and expand Americans' access to important resources in the humanities.\"\nThe annual Charles Frankel Prize in the Humanities was established in 1988 and succeeded by the National Humanities Medal in 1997. The token is a bronze medal designed by a 1995 Frankel Prize winner, David Macaulay.\nMedals are conferred annually, usually by the U.S. President, to as many as twelve living candidates and existing organizations nominated early in the calendar year. The president selects the winners in consultation with the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). NEH asks that nominators consult the list of previous winners and consider the National Medal of Arts to recognize contributions in \"the creative or performing arts\".\n\n\n== Recipients ==\nMedalists are listed by year, then alphabetically by surname.\n\n\n=== The Charles Frankel Prize ===\n1989\n\n1990\n\n1991\n\n1992\n\n1993\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n\n=== The National Humanities Medal ===\n1997\n\n1998\n\n1999\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\nNone awarded\n2017\nNone awarded\n2018\nNone awarded\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Medal of Arts\nNational Medal of Science\nNational Medal of Technology and Innovation\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBarbara is a given name used in numerous languages. It is the feminine form of the Greek word barbaros (Greek: \u03b2\u03ac\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2) meaning \"stranger\" or \"foreign\". In Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox tradition, Saint Barbara (Greek: \u1f09\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 \u0392\u03b1\u03c1\u03b2\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1) was imprisoned in a tower by her father. She was then  martyred by her father when she refused to renounce Christianity. According to legend, her father was then punished with death by lightning. As such, Saint Barbara is a protectress against fire and lightning. Early Christians occasionally referred to themselves as \"barbarians\" in opposition to the pagan Romans and Greeks. The story of Saint Barbara is said to have been an inspiration for the fairy tale Rapunzel and other European stories that feature a maiden in a tower.\nToday, the name Barbara or its variants are commonly given to female babies born in such countries as Chile, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and Russia, among others. Barbie, a traditional English hypocorism for the name and the brand name of a popular fashion doll, is well-used as an independent name for girls and women in the American Amish community. There was also increased interest in the name Barbie following the release of the 2023 film Barbie. Barbara was among the most popular names for girls in English-speaking countries in the first half of the 20th century but has since decreased in usage in countries such as the United States.There were 271 American girls named Barbara and 27 American girls named Barbie in 2022. The name increased in usage in 2023 in the United States, with 305 newborn girls given the name that year, an increase of 87 from 2022. The name ranked 877th on the popularity chart in 2023. Another 32 American girls were named Barbie in 2023. The popular film Barbie, in which the main character begins using the name Barbara, came out in 2023.\nIn Italy, Barbara was particularly popular during the 1970s: it was among the top 10 names given to girls born from 1969 to 1977, rising to 2nd place (behind Maria) in 1971. In the same year, it was the most common name for girls born in Rome and in Bologna.\n\n\n== Variants ==\n\n\n== People with the given name Barbara (or variants) ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nVarvara (disambiguation)\nAll pages with titles beginning with Barbara (given name) \n\n\n== References ==\nDavid Copperfield is a novel by English author Charles Dickens, narrated by the eponymous David Copperfield, detailing his adventures in his journey from infancy to maturity. As such, it is typically categorized in the bildungsroman genre. It was published as a serial in 1849 and 1850 and then as a book in 1850.\nDavid Copperfield is also a partially autobiographical novel: \"a very complicated weaving of truth and invention\", with events following Dickens's own life. Of the books he wrote, it was his favourite. Called \"the triumph of the art of Dickens\", it marks a turning point in his work, separating the novels of youth and those of maturity.\nAt first glance, the work is modelled on 18th-century \"personal histories\" that were very popular, like Henry Fielding's Joseph Andrews or Tom Jones, but David Copperfield is a more carefully structured work. It begins, like other novels by Dickens, with a bleak picture of childhood in Victorian England, followed by young Copperfield's slow social ascent, as he painfully provides for his aunt, while continuing his studies.\nDickens wrote without an outline, unlike his previous novel, Dombey and Son. Some aspects of the story were fixed in his mind from the start, but others were undecided until the serial publications were underway. The novel has a primary theme of growth and change, but Dickens also satirises many aspects of Victorian life. These include the plight of prostitutes, the status of women in marriage, class structure, the criminal justice system, the quality of schools, and the employment of children in factories.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\nThe story follows the life of David Copperfield from childhood to maturity. David was born in Blunderstone, Suffolk, England, six months after the death of his father. David spends his early years residing in a small house called the Rookery. His loving and childish mother and their kindly housekeeper, Clara Peggotty, raise him here, where they call him Davy. When he is seven-years old his mother marries Edward Murdstone without having told him they plan to marry. To get him out of the way, David is sent to visit with Peggotty's family in Yarmouth. Her brother, fisherman Mr Peggotty, lives in a beached barge, with his adopted niece and nephew Emily and Ham, and an elderly widow, Mrs Gummidge. \"Little Em'ly\" is somewhat spoiled by her fond foster father, and David is in love with her. They call him Master Copperfield.\nOn his return, David discovers his mother has married and is immediately given good reason to dislike his stepfather, Murdstone, who believes exclusively in stern, harsh methods of parenting, calling it \"firmness\". David has similar feelings for Murdstone's sister Jane, who moves into the house soon afterwards. Between them they tyrannise David and his poor mother, making their lives miserable. When David falls behind in his studies, Murdstone thrashes him, and David bites his hand; in consequence, he is sent away to Salem House, a boarding school, under a ruthless headmaster named Mr Creakle. There he is befriended by an older boy, James Steerforth, and Tommy Traddles. He develops an impassioned admiration for Steerforth, perceiving him as someone noble, who could do great things if he would, and one who pays attention to him.\nDavid goes home for the holidays to learn that his mother has given birth to a baby boy. Shortly after David returns to Salem House, his mother and her baby die, and David returns home immediately. Peggotty marries the local carrier, Mr Barkis. Murdstone sends David to work for a wine merchant in London \u2013 a business of which Murdstone is a joint owner. After some months, David's friendly but spendthrift landlord, Wilkins Micawber, is arrested for debt and sent to the King's Bench Prison, and the rest of Mr. Micawber's family soon moves to the Prison too.  David continues to visit regularly with the Micawbers at the Prison, and boards nearby.  When Micawber's release is imminent, the Micawbers decide they wil\nHemiparesis, also called unilateral paresis, is the weakness of one entire side of the body (hemi- means \"half\"). Hemiplegia, in its most severe form, is the complete paralysis of one entire side of the body. Either hemiparesis or hemiplegia can result from a variety of medical causes, including congenital conditions, trauma, tumors, traumatic brain injury and stroke.\n\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\nDifferent types of hemiparesis can impair different bodily functions.  Some effects, such as weakness or partial paralysis of a limb on the affected side, are generally always to be expected. Other impairments can appear, upon external examination, to be unrelated to the limb weakness, but are nevertheless also caused by damage to the affected side of the brain.\n\n\n=== Loss of motor skills ===\nPeople with hemiparesis often have difficulties maintaining their balance due to limb paralysis, leading to an inability to properly shift body weight. This makes performing everyday activities, such as dressing, eating, grasping objects, or using the bathroom, more difficult. Hemiparesis with origin in the lower section of the brain creates a condition known as ataxia, a loss of both gross and fine motor skills, which often manifests as a staggering and stumbling gait. Pure motor hemiparesis, a form of hemiparesis characterized by one-sided weakness in the leg, arm, and face, is the most commonly diagnosed form of hemiparesis.\n\n\n=== Pusher syndrome ===\n\nPusher syndrome is a clinical disorder following left- or right-sided brain damage, in which patients actively push their weight away from the non-hemiparetic side to the hemiparetic side. This is in contrast to most stroke patients, who typically prefer to bear more weight on their nonhemiparetic side. Pusher syndrome can vary in severity and leads to a loss of postural balance. The lesion involved in this syndrome is thought to be in the posterior thalamus on either side, or in multiple areas of the right cerebral hemisphere.\nA diagnosis of pusher syndrome includes observation of three behaviours. The most obvious one is the patient's regularly occurring (not just occasional) tendency to spontaneously hold a body posture in which the torso is longitudinally tilted toward the paretic side of the body.  The second is the patient's use of the nonparetic extremities including abduction and extension of the extremities of the non-affected side, to help in the push toward the affected (paretic) side, resulting in an abnormal lateral tilt of the body axis. The third is that, when a care provider tries to realign the patient's body to an upright posture, the patient spontaneously pushes back against the attempt, feeling this normal posture to be off balance.\nThe pusher syndrome is present in 10.4% of patients with acute stroke and hemiparesis, and may increase the time needed for physical rehabilitation. The Copenhagen Stroke Study found that patients who presented with ipsilateral pushing took an average of 3.6 additional weeks to reach the same functional outcome, as measured by the Barthel Index, compared with acute-stroke and hemiparesis patients who did not engage in ipsilateral pushing.\nPushing behaviour demonstrates that these patients\u2019 perception of their body posture in relation to gravity has been altered. They experience their body as oriented \"upright\" when the body is actually tilted to the side of the brain lesion. At the same time, their processing of visual and vestibular inputs when determining the subjective visual vertical seems to be normal. When they are sitting, the pushing presents as a strong lateral lean toward the affected side. When they stand up, the pushing creates a highly unstable situation as they are unable to support their body weight on the weakened lower extremity. The resulting increased risk of falls must be addressed with therapy aimed at correcting their altered proprioceptive perception of vertical.\nPusher syndrome is sometimes confused with hemispatial neglect, a\nPocahontas (US:   , UK: ; born Amonute, also known as Matoaka and Rebecca Rolfe; c. 1596 \u2013 March 1617) was a Native American woman belonging to the Powhatan people, notable for her association with the colonial settlement at Jamestown, Virginia. She was the daughter of Powhatan, the paramount chief of a network of tributary tribes in the Tsenacommacah, encompassing the Tidewater region of what is today the U.S. state of Virginia.\nPocahontas was captured and held for ransom by English colonists during hostilities in 1613. During her captivity, she was encouraged to convert to Christianity and was baptized under the name Rebecca. She married the tobacco planter John Rolfe in April 1614 at the age of about 17 or 18, and she bore their son, Thomas Rolfe, in January 1615.\nIn 1616, the Rolfes travelled to London, where Pocahontas was presented to English society as an example of the \"civilized savage\" in hopes of stimulating investment in Jamestown. On this trip she may have met Squanto, a Patuxet man from New England. Pocahontas became a celebrity, was elegantly f\u00eated, and attended a masque at Whitehall Palace. In 1617, the Rolfes intended to sail for Virginia, but Pocahontas died at Gravesend, Kent, England, of unknown causes, aged 20 or 21. She was buried in St George's Church, Gravesend; her grave's exact location is unknown because the church was rebuilt after being destroyed by a fire.\nNumerous places, landmarks, and products in the United States have been named after Pocahontas. Her story has been romanticized over the years, many aspects of which are fictional. Many of the stories told about her by the English explorer John Smith have been contested by her documented descendants. She is a subject of art, literature, and film. Many famous people have claimed to be among her descendants, including members of the First Families of Virginia, First Lady Edith Wilson, American actor Glenn Strange, and astronomer Percival Lowell.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nPocahontas's birth year is unknown, but some historians estimate it to have been around 1596. In A True Relation of Virginia (1608), the English explorer John Smith described meeting Pocahontas in the spring of 1608 when she was \"a child of ten years old\". In a 1616 letter, Smith again described her as she was in 1608, but this time as \"a child of twelve or thirteen years of age\".\nPocahontas was the daughter of Chief Powhatan, paramount chief of Tsenacommacah, an alliance of about thirty Algonquian-speaking groups and petty chiefdoms in the Tidewater region of the present-day U.S. state of Virginia. Her mother's name and origin are unknown, but she was probably of lowly status. English adventurer Henry Spelman had lived among the Powhatan people as an interpreter, and he noted that, when one of the paramount chief's many wives gave birth, she was returned to her place of origin and supported there by the paramount chief until she found another husband. However, little is known about Pocahontas's mother, and it has been theorized that she died in childbirth. The Mattaponi Reservation people are descendants of the Powhatans, and their oral tradition claims that Pocahontas's mother was the first wife of Powhatan and that Pocahontas was named after her.\n\n\n=== Names ===\nAccording to colonist William Strachey, \"Pocahontas\" was a childhood nickname meaning \"little wanton\". Some interpret the meaning as \"playful one\". In his account, Strachey describes Pocahontas as a child visiting the fort at Jamestown and playing with the young boys; she would \"get the boys forth with her into the marketplace and make them wheel, falling on their hands, turning up their heels upwards, whom she would follow and wheel so herself, naked as she was, all the fort over\".\nHistorian William Stith claimed that \"her real name, it seems, was originally Matoax, which the Native Americans carefully concealed from the English and changed it to Pocahontas, out of a superstitious fear, lest they, by the knowledge of her true", "metadata": {"title": "Barbara Kingsolver", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Kingsolver"}}
