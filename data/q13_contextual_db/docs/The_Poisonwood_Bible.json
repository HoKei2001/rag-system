{"page_content": "The Poisonwood Bible (1998), by Barbara Kingsolver, is a best-selling novel about a missionary family, the Prices, who in 1959 move from the U.S. state of Georgia to the village of Kilanga in the Belgian Congo, close to the Kwilu River. \nThe novel's title refers to Bible errata. The father of the family creates his own \"misprint\" of the Bible. He concludes his sermons with the Kikongo expression \"Tata Jesus is b\u00e4ngala\" with the intent of saying \"Jesus is most precious\". In his hurried mispronunciation, he actually says \"Jesus is poisonwood\".\n\n\n== Plot ==\nOrleanna Price, the mother of the family, narrates the introductory chapter in five of the novel's seven sections. The narrative then alternates among the four daughters, with a slight preference for the voice of the most conflicted one, Leah. The four girls increasingly mature and develop differently as each adapts to African village life and the political turmoil that overtakes the Belgian Congo in the 1960s.\nThe Price family packs up their belongings for their flight to the Congo, where they are going to spend a year as the family of a missionary. However, shortly before leaving, they are informed that they are limited to 44 pounds of luggage per person. The Southern Baptist Mission League suggests they solve this problem by leaving for the airport wearing many layers of clothing, hiding household items among the layers of clothes to lighten their luggage.\nThe Price daughters \u2013 Rachel, Leah, Adah and Ruth May \u2013 and their mother, Orleanna, and father, Nathan, attend their first church service in the village of Kilanga, and they realize how different their culture is from that of the Congo. For example, 14-year-old Leah helps her father plant a \"demonstration garden\"; it immediately receives criticism from Mama Tataba, whom the family has engaged as a live-in maid, and the garden does poorly due to the inappropriate climate. Nathan tries to hold an impromptu Easter celebration in hopes of baptizing numerous people, but he is unable to carry this out, as the river along the village, where he plans to hold the baptism, is infested with crocodiles.\nLeah and her twin Adah begin to spy on Eeben Axelroot, the pilot who conveyed the family to Kilanga, and Nathan tries to convince Congolese men, one by one, to convert to Christianity. Meanwhile, five-year-old Ruth May befriends the village children. She finds out about Axelroot's business with the diamonds after breaking her arm.\nAfter Mama Tataba departs, an orphan boy named Nelson becomes the family servant. Nathan and Leah go to Leopoldville (present day Kinshasa) to witness what is going on with the independence in the Congo. Methuselah (a parrot the Prices adopted from the previous missionary) dies, and Adah finds his feathers. Ruth May becomes very sick and lies in bed for the majority of the day. Leah begins to spend a lot of time with Anatole, Kilanga's teacher, discussing topics such as justice and the Congo. Leah wants to participate in the hunt, which upsets the village elders, as it would go against their custom, but she eventually is allowed to participate and even hunts an antelope.\nThe girls all gather together in the morning to check out the chicken coop. Inside they find footprints and a green mamba snake. A scream and gasp is heard from Ruth May, who has been bitten by the snake. The girls watch her turn cold and blue before she dies. Orleanna becomes filled with guilt over Ruth May's death, and takes the other children away, leaving her arrogant husband to fend for himself. With Anatole's help, they eventually reach safety.\nThe remaining Price sisters go through many different life changes: Adah dedicates herself to getting a scientific education back home (she is hemiplegic and wants to learn more about the condition); Leah marries Anatole and they start a family together; Rachel remains perceptive but vain and distrustful of men, goes through a string of marriages, and starts a business; and Nathan dies in his un\nBarbara Ellen Kingsolver (born April 8, 1955) is a Pulitzer Prize-winning American novelist, essayist, and poet. Her widely known works include The Poisonwood Bible, the tale of a missionary family in the Congo, and Animal, Vegetable, Miracle, a nonfiction account of her family's attempts to eat locally. In 2023, she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for the novel Demon Copperhead. Her work often focuses on topics such as social justice, biodiversity, and the interaction between humans and their communities and environments.\nKingsolver has received numerous awards, including the Dayton Literary Peace Prize's Richard C. Holbrooke Distinguished Achievement Award 2011 and the National Humanities Medal. After winning for The Lacuna in 2010 and Demon Copperhead in 2023, Kingsolver became the first author to win the Women's Prize for Fiction twice.  Since 1993, each one of her book titles have been on the New York Times Best Seller list.\nKingsolver was raised in rural Kentucky, lived briefly in the Congo in her early childhood, and she currently lives in Appalachia. Kingsolver earned degrees in biology, ecology, and evolutionary biology at DePauw University and the University of Arizona, and worked as a freelance writer before she began writing novels. In 2000, the politically progressive Kingsolver established the Bellwether Prize to support \"literature of social change\".\n\n\n== Biography ==\nKingsolver was born in 1955 in Annapolis, Maryland, the daughter of Wendell Roy Kingsolver and Virginia Lee (n\u00e9e Henry) Kingsolver, but grew up in Carlisle, Kentucky. When Kingsolver was seven, her father, a physician, took the family to L\u00e9opoldville, Congo (now Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo).\nAfter graduating from high school, Kingsolver attended DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, on a music scholarship, studying classical piano. She changed her major to biology after realizing that \"classical pianists compete for six job openings a year, and the rest of [them] get to play 'Blue Moon' in a hotel lobby\".\nKingsolver was involved in activism on her campus, and took part in protests against the Vietnam War. In 1977, Kingsolver graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a Bachelor of Science, and moved to France for a year.  In 1980, she enrolled in graduate school at the University of Arizona, where she earned a master's degree in ecology and evolutionary biology.\nIn 1985, Kingsolver married Joseph Hoffmann, and gave birth to their daughter Camille in 1987.  During the first First Gulf War, she moved with her daughter to Tenerife in the Canary Islands for a year, mostly due to her frustration over America's military involvement. After returning to the United States in 1992, she separated from her husband.\nIn 1994, Kingsolver was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters from her alma mater, DePauw University. That same year, she married Steven Lee Hopp, an ornithologist, and their daughter Lily was born in 1996. In 2004, Kingsolver moved with her family to a farm in Washington County, Virginia. In 2008, she received an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Duke University, where she delivered a commencement address entitled \"How to Be Hopeful\".\nIn the late 1990s, Kingsolver was a founding member of the Rock Bottom Remainders, a rock-and-roll band made up of published writers. Other band members included Amy Tan, Matt Groening, Dave Barry, and Stephen King, and they played for one week during the year. Kingsolver played the keyboard, but is no longer an active member of the band.\nIn a 2010 interview with The Guardian, Kingsolver said, \"I never wanted to be famous, and still don't\u2026 the universe rewarded me with what I dreaded most\". She said she created her own website just to compete with a plethora of fake ones \"as a defense to protect my family from misinformation\".\nKingsolver lives in the Appalachia area of the United States. She said in 2020 that rural America is generally regarded by artistic elites with \"a profound antipathy\nThroughout history, printers' errors, unconventional translations and translation mistakes have appeared in a number of published Bibles. Bibles with features considered to be erroneous are known as Bible errata, and were often destroyed or suppressed due to their contents being considered heretical by some.\n\n\n== Manuscript Bibles ==\n\n\n=== The Book of Kells, c.\u2009800 ===\n\nThe Book of Kells features two errors within its text:\n\nThe genealogy of Jesus, in the Gospel of Luke, lists an extra ancestor in Luke 3:26. This error is considered to have resulted from the transcriber reading the phrase \"QUI FUIT MATHATHIAE\" as \"QUI FUIT MATHATH, with the \"IAE\" being considered an additional individual, resulting in the lines \"QUI FUIT MATHATH\" and the additional \"QUI FUIT IAE\", rather than the singular \"QUI FUIT MATHATHIAE\".\nIn the Gospel of Matthew, 10:34b should read \"I came not to send peace, but the sword\". However, rather than the Latin gladium, meaning \"sword\", the Book of Kells has gaudium, meaning \"joy\", rendering the verse \"I came not [only] to send peace, but [also] joy\".\n\n\n=== The Book of Deer, 10th century ===\nThe Scottish Book of Deer in Cambridge University Library has a number of errors.  In the genealogy of Jesus in the Gospel of Luke, it has Seth as the first man and grandfather of Adam.\n\n\n== Printed Bibles ==\n\n\n=== Edmund Becke's Bibles ===\n\"Wife-Beater's Bible\" (1549; 1551): A footnote to 1 Peter 3:7, inserted by Edmund Becke, reads \"And if she be not obediente and healpeful unto hym, endevoureth to beate the fere of God into her heade, that thereby she may be compelled to learne her dutye and do it.\"\n\n\n=== Geneva ===\n\"Place-makers' Bible\" 1562: the second edition of the Geneva Bible, Matthew 5:9 reads \"Blessed are the placemakers: for they shall be called the children of God\"; it should read \"peacemakers\".\nIn its chapter heading for Luke 21, the Place-makers' Bible has \"Christ condemneth the poor widow\", rather than \"commendeth\".\n\n\n=== Douai ===\n\"Manchester edition\" 1793: The heading on Chapter 3 of Leviticus and the first verse has \"bees\" rather than \"beeves\" (plural of beef). It reads: \"How the pacifique hosts must be of bees, sheep, lambs and goats\" (\"pacifique hosts\" meaning peace offerings).\n\n\n=== King James ===\n\nIn various printings of the King James Version of the Bible, some of the more famous examples have been given their own names. Among them are:\n\n\"Judas Bible\", from 1613: This Bible has Judas, not Jesus, saying \"Sit ye here while I go yonder and pray\" (Matthew 26:36). A second folio edition printed by Robert Barker, printer to King James I, is held in St. Mary's Church, Totnes, Devon. In this copy, the misprint has been covered with a small slip of paper glued over the name of Judas.\n\"Printers Bible\", from 1612: In some copies, Psalm 119:161 reads, \"Printers have persecuted me without a cause\", rather than \"Princes have persecuted me...\"\n\"Wicked Bible\", \"Adulterous Bible\" or \"Sinner's Bible\", from 1631: Barker and Lucas: Omits an important \"not\" from Exodus 20:14, making the seventh commandment read \"Thou shalt commit adultery.\" An 1886 study of Star Chamber case reports suggests that this was just one of the \"two grossest errors\" in the printing, alongside Deuteronomy 5:24, which read \"the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his great-asse\" instead of the correct \"greatness[e]\". However, this second error does not appear in any extant copy of the Bible. The printers were fined \u00a3300 and most of the copies were recalled immediately. Only 15 copies survive in the collections of public institutions in the English-speaking world.\n\"More Sea Bible\", from 1641: \"...the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was more sea\", rather than \"...the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea\", from Revelation 21:1\n\"Unrighteous Bible\" or \"Wicked Bible\", from 1653, Cambridge Press: Another edition carrying this title omits a \"not\" before the word \"inherit\", making 1\nHemiparesis, also called unilateral paresis, is the weakness of one entire side of the body (hemi- means \"half\"). Hemiplegia, in its most severe form, is the complete paralysis of one entire side of the body. Either hemiparesis or hemiplegia can result from a variety of medical causes, including congenital conditions, trauma, tumors, traumatic brain injury and stroke.\n\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\nDifferent types of hemiparesis can impair different bodily functions.  Some effects, such as weakness or partial paralysis of a limb on the affected side, are generally always to be expected. Other impairments can appear, upon external examination, to be unrelated to the limb weakness, but are nevertheless also caused by damage to the affected side of the brain.\n\n\n=== Loss of motor skills ===\nPeople with hemiparesis often have difficulties maintaining their balance due to limb paralysis, leading to an inability to properly shift body weight. This makes performing everyday activities, such as dressing, eating, grasping objects, or using the bathroom, more difficult. Hemiparesis with origin in the lower section of the brain creates a condition known as ataxia, a loss of both gross and fine motor skills, which often manifests as a staggering and stumbling gait. Pure motor hemiparesis, a form of hemiparesis characterized by one-sided weakness in the leg, arm, and face, is the most commonly diagnosed form of hemiparesis.\n\n\n=== Pusher syndrome ===\n\nPusher syndrome is a clinical disorder following left- or right-sided brain damage, in which patients actively push their weight away from the non-hemiparetic side to the hemiparetic side. This is in contrast to most stroke patients, who typically prefer to bear more weight on their nonhemiparetic side. Pusher syndrome can vary in severity and leads to a loss of postural balance. The lesion involved in this syndrome is thought to be in the posterior thalamus on either side, or in multiple areas of the right cerebral hemisphere.\nA diagnosis of pusher syndrome includes observation of three behaviours. The most obvious one is the patient's regularly occurring (not just occasional) tendency to spontaneously hold a body posture in which the torso is longitudinally tilted toward the paretic side of the body.  The second is the patient's use of the nonparetic extremities including abduction and extension of the extremities of the non-affected side, to help in the push toward the affected (paretic) side, resulting in an abnormal lateral tilt of the body axis. The third is that, when a care provider tries to realign the patient's body to an upright posture, the patient spontaneously pushes back against the attempt, feeling this normal posture to be off balance.\nThe pusher syndrome is present in 10.4% of patients with acute stroke and hemiparesis, and may increase the time needed for physical rehabilitation. The Copenhagen Stroke Study found that patients who presented with ipsilateral pushing took an average of 3.6 additional weeks to reach the same functional outcome, as measured by the Barthel Index, compared with acute-stroke and hemiparesis patients who did not engage in ipsilateral pushing.\nPushing behaviour demonstrates that these patients\u2019 perception of their body posture in relation to gravity has been altered. They experience their body as oriented \"upright\" when the body is actually tilted to the side of the brain lesion. At the same time, their processing of visual and vestibular inputs when determining the subjective visual vertical seems to be normal. When they are sitting, the pushing presents as a strong lateral lean toward the affected side. When they stand up, the pushing creates a highly unstable situation as they are unable to support their body weight on the weakened lower extremity. The resulting increased risk of falls must be addressed with therapy aimed at correcting their altered proprioceptive perception of vertical.\nPusher syndrome is sometimes confused with hemispatial neglect, a\nThe Big Read was a survey on books carried out by the BBC in the United Kingdom in 2003, where over three-quarters of a million votes were received from the British public to find the nation's best-loved novel. The year-long survey was the biggest single test of public reading taste to date, and culminated with several programmes hosted by celebrities, advocating their favourite books.\n\n\n== Purpose ==\nThe BBC started the Big Read with the goal of finding the \"Nation's Best-loved Novel\" by way of a viewer vote via the Web, SMS, and telephone. The show attracted controversy for adopting an allegedly sensationalist approach to literature, but supporters praised it for raising the public awareness of reading. The British public voted originally for any novel that they wished. From this, a list of 200 was drawn up, with the highest 21 then put forward for further voting, on the provision that only one book per author was permitted in the top 21. As the poll was based on novels, the plays of William Shakespeare were not part of the survey.\n\n\n== Top 200 novels in the United Kingdom ==\n\n\n== Authors with multiple novels on the list ==\nMultiple novels in the Top 25\nIn the first stage, all four extant Harry Potter novels by J. K. Rowling were among the 25 leaders. So were both Middle-earth novels by J. R. R. Tolkien. The second stage featured 21 books by distinct authors: the top 25 with Rowling represented only by her fourth volume, Goblet of Fire, and Tolkien only by The Lord of the Rings. Those two novels finally placed fifth and first; the other preliminary leaders by Rowling and Tolkien nominally led the also-rans in ranks 22\u201325.\n\nMultiple novels in the Top 50\nFour: J. K.

The event had an attendance of 60,000 people and was one of the most watched televised events at the time. Ali won by knockout in the eighth round.\nIt has been called \"arguably the greatest sporting event of the 20th century\" and was a major upset, with Ali coming in as a 4\u20131 underdog against the unbeaten, heavy-hitting Foreman. The fight is famous for Ali's introduction of the rope-a-dope tactic.\nSome sources estimate that the fight was watched by as many as one billion television viewers around the world, becoming the world's most-watched live television broadcast at the time. This included a record estimated 50 million viewers watching the fight on pay-per-view or closed-circuit theatre TV. The fight grossed an estimated $100 million (inflation-adjusted $600 million) in worldwide revenue. Decades later, the bout would be the subject of the Academy Award winning documentary film When We Were Kings.\n\n\n== Inception ==\n\nDon King arranged the fight with music businessman Jerry Masucci, who took his record label's showcase group, the Fania All-Stars, to play at the venue. King managed to get Ali and Foreman to sign separate contracts saying they would fight for him if he could get a $5 million purse. Such an amount of money, quite enormous for those days, was purported to prevent other top boxing promoters from attempts to arrange a Foreman vs. Ali match. However, as King did not have the money, and was not welcomed to stage an event of such a profile in the United States, he began seeking an outside country to stage and sponsor the event. Fred Weymar, an American advisor to Zaire's dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, persuaded Mobutu that the publicity such a high-profile event would generate would help his regime, and Mobutu agreed for the fight to be held in his country. In a TV interview, King stated that Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi was involved in making the payment for the purse money for the athletes and other major expenses, although the precise process was not made clear.\nKing had pulled together a consortium that included Risnelia Investment from Panama; the Hemdale Film Corporation, a British company founded by film producer John Daly and the actor David Hemmings; Video Techniques Incorporated of New York; and Don King Productions. Although King is most closely associated with the fight, Hemdale and Video Techniques Inc., with whom King was a director, were the bout's official co-promoters. The fight was broadcast on closed-circuit television in theaters in the United States and on over-the-air television throughout the world. The play-by-play commentary was done by \"Colonel\" Bob Sheridan. Color commentary was done by Jim Brown, David Frost, and Joe Frazier.\n\n\n== Build-up and delay due to injury ==\nIn 1967, then-champion Ali was stripped of his title and suspended from boxing for 3+1\u20442 years for his refusal to comply with the draft and enter the U.S. Army. In 1970, he first regained a boxing license and promptly fought comeback fights against Jerry Quarry and Oscar Bonavena in an attempt to regain the heavyweight championship from the then-undefeated Joe Frazier. In a bout dubbed the Fight of the Century, Frazier won a unanimous decision, leaving Ali fighting other contenders for years in an attempt at a new title shot.\nMeanwhile, the heavily muscled Foreman had quickly risen from a gold-medal victory at the 1968 Olympics to the top ranks of the heavyweight division. Greatly feared for his punching power, size, and sheer physical dominance, Foreman was nonetheless underestimated by Frazier and his promoters, and knocked the champion down six times in two rounds before the bout was stopped. He fur\nStade Tata Rapha\u00ebl (Father Raphael Stadium) is a multi-purpose stadium in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Originally known as Stade Roi Baudouin (King Baudouin Stadium) when it was inaugurated in 1952 and Stade du 20 Mai (20 May Stadium) in 1967, it was used mostly for football matches. The stadium has a capacity of 60,000 people.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe stadium's most famous event was The Rumble in the Jungle boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman for the Undisputed WBC/WBA Heavyweight Championship that took place on October 30, 1974. Sixty thousand people attended the boxing match. In what was ranked as a great upset, Ali knocked out the previously undefeated Foreman in eight rounds. The associated music festival, Zaire 74, that took place at the stadium six weeks prior to the boxing match, included stars James Brown and B.B. King.\nFollowing the downfall of President Mobutu Sese Seko's regime in 1997, the stadium was renamed Stade Tata Rapha\u00ebl after Rapha\u00ebl de la Kethulle de Ryhove, initiator of the stadium in 1952.\nThe stadium was the setting for a documentary film about Congolese women's boxing, Victoire Terminus (2008).\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nBarbara Kingsolver's novel The Poisonwood Bible (1998) includes a passage describing the Rumble in the Jungle taking place at the Stade du 20 Mai (20 May Stadium) while political prisoners are locked up downstairs.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of football stadiums in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nLists of stadiums\n\n\n== References ==\nMother may I? is a children's game, also known as \"captain may I?\" and \"father may I?\".\n\n\n== Objective, rules, and general gameplay ==\nOne player plays the \"mother\",  \"father\" or \"captain\". The other players are the \"children\" or \"crewmembers\".  To begin the game, the mother or father stands at one end of a room and turns around facing away, while all the children line up at the other end.  The children take turns asking, \"mother/father, may I ____?\" and makes a movement suggestion.  For example, one might ask, \"Mother/Father, may I take five steps forward?\"  The mother/father either replies \"Yes, you may\" or \"No, you may not do that, but you may _____ instead\" and inserts their own suggestion.  The players usually move closer to the mother/father but are sometimes led farther away. Even if the mother/father makes an unfavorable suggestion, the child must still perform it. The first of the children to reach the location of the mother/father wins the game. That child then becomes the mother/father himself, the original mother/father becomes a child, and a new round begins.\nSome suggestions that fill in the \"mother/father/captain, may I ____?\" blank include:\n\nTake (#) steps forward\nTake (#) giant steps forward (usually a small number, due to large step size)\nTake (#) baby steps forward (usually a large number, due to tiny step size)\nTake (#) umbrella steps forward\nHop forward like a frog, (#) times\nRun forward for (#) seconds\nCrabwalk forward for (#) seconds\nTake (#) Cinderella steps - twirl forward with index finger touching the top of the head\nOpen-and-shut the book (#) times - jump forwards with feet apart then again bringing the feet together\nLamppost - lie face down and stretch arms forwards, bring your feet to the point reached by the fingertips\nIf the \"children\" are reaching the \"mother\" or \"father\" too quickly, the \"mother\"/\"father\" may reject the child's suggestion by replacing it with \"No, you may not do that, but you may ____ instead.\" They may reduce the child's original suggestion (for example, reducing five giant steps to three giant steps), or make a different suggestion, such as:\n\nTake (#) steps backward\nRun backward for (#) seconds\nWalk backward until I (mother/father) say \"stop\"\nReturn to the starting line (in rare cases)\nA common alternative gameplay is for \"mother\" or \"father\" (who can be facing the children) to begin each child's turn by issuing the instruction to be carried out. The child must reply, \"Mother/Father, may I?\" before carrying out the order, to which Mother/Father always consents. However, if the child omits to ask permission he or she is required to go back to the start. Children who have advanced a long way towards the goal are thus brought to ruin; instructions to go backwards must also be asked for lest a worse fate awaits. The art to being a good mother or father is to bring everyone as equally as possible.\nOther variations of this kind of crossing-over game are \"what's the time, Mr. Wolf?\" (sometimes called \"old Mrs. Fox, what time is it?\", although this version is slightly different), \"grandmother's footsteps\" and \"bulldog\", played in Britain. In the first of these, gameplay is similar: Mr Wolf faces away from the children (or Mrs. Fox faces the children), the children together chant in a well-known fashion \"what's the time, Mr Wolf?\" (or \"old Mrs. Fox, what time is it?\"), and if he or she replies with 9 o'clock, the children move 9 steps forward. Should anyone reach Mr. Wolf, he or she becomes the new Mr Wolf. Alternatively, however, should Mr. Wolf reply to the question by saying \"dinner time!\" (or in the Mrs. Fox version, \"midnight!\") he turns and chases the children back towards the start. If he catches one before he or she reaches safety, that child is the new Mr. Wolf.\n\n\n== References in fiction ==\nMother Mae-Eye is the name of a villain from the Teen Titans animated series.\n\"Mother May I\" is a track by Coheed and Cambria that features on their 2005 album, Good Apollo, I'm Burning \nMobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu wa za Banga ( ; born Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu; 14 October 1930 \u2013 7 September 1997), often shortened to Mobutu Sese Seko or Mobutu and also known by his initials MSS, was a Congolese politician and military officer who was the 1st and only President of Zaire from 1971 to 1997. Previously, Mobutu served as the 2nd President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 1965 to 1971. He also served as the 5th Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity from 1967 to 1968. During the Congo Crisis, Mobutu, serving as Chief of Staff of the Army and supported by Belgium and the United States, deposed the democratically elected government of left-wing nationalist Patrice Lumumba in 1960. Mobutu installed a government that arranged for Lumumba's execution in 1961, and continued to lead the country's armed forces until he took power directly in a second coup in 1965.\nTo consolidate his power, he established the Popular Movement of the Revolution as the sole legal political party in 1967, changed the Congo's name to Zaire in 1971, and his own name to Mobutu Sese Seko in 1972. Mobutu claimed that his political ideology was \"neither left nor right, nor even centre\", though nevertheless he developed a regime that was intensely autocratic. He attempted to purge the country of all colonial cultural influence through his program of \"national authenticity\". Mobutu was the object of a pervasive cult of personality. During his rule, he amassed a large personal fortune through economic exploitation and corruption, leading some to call his rule a \"kleptocracy\". He presided over a period of widespread human rights violations. Under his rule, the nation also suffered from uncontrolled inflation, a large debt, and massive currency devaluations.\nMobutu received strong support (military, diplomatic and economic) from the United States, France, and Belgium, who believed he was a strong opponent of communism in Francophone Africa. He also built close ties with the governments of apartheid South Africa, Israel and the Greek junta. From 1972 onward, he was also supported by Mao Zedong of China, mainly due to his anti-Soviet stance but also as part of Mao's attempts to create a bloc of Afro-Asian nations led by him. The massive Chinese economic aid that flowed into Zaire gave Mobutu more flexibility in his dealings with Western governments, allowed him to identify as an \"anti-capitalist revolutionary\", and enabled him to avoid going to the International Monetary Fund for assistance.\nBy 1990, economic deterioration and unrest forced Mobutu Sese Seko into coalition with his power opponents. Although he used his troops to thwart change, his antics did not last long. In May 1997, rebel forces led by Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila overran the country and forced him into exile. Already suffering from advanced prostate cancer, he died three months later in Morocco. Mobutu was notorious for corruption, nepotism, and having amassed between US$50 million and $125 million during his rule. He was known for extravagances such as shopping trips to Paris via the supersonic Concorde aircraft.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early years and education ===\nMobutu, a member of the Ngbandi ethnic group, was born in 1930 in Lisala, Belgian Congo. Mobutu's mother, Marie Madeleine Yemo, was a hotel maid who fled to Lisala to escape the harem of a local village chief. There she met and married Alb\u00e9ric Gbemani, a cook for a Belgian judge. Shortly afterward she gave birth to Mobutu. The name \"Mobutu\" was selected by an uncle.\nGbemani died when Mobutu was eight. Thereafter, he was raised by an uncle and a grandfather.\nThe Belgian judge's wife took a liking to Mobutu and taught him to speak, read, and write fluently in the French language, the official language of the country in the colonial period. His widowed mother Yemo relied on the help of relatives to support her four children, and the family moved often. Mobutu's earliest education took place in the capital L\u00e9opoldville \nProdigal Summer (2000) is the fifth novel by American author Barbara Kingsolver.  Heavily emphasizing ecological themes and her trademark interweaving plots, this novel tells three stories of love, loss and connections in rural Virginia.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nProdigal Summer tells the story of a small town in Appalachia during a single, humid summer, when three interweaving stories of love, loss and family unfold against the backdrop of the lush wildness of Virginia mountains. The narrative follows Deanna, a solitary woman working as a park ranger; Lusa, a recently widowed entomologist at odds with her late farmer husband's tight-knit family; and Garnett, an old man who dreams of restoring the lineage of the extinct American Chestnut tree.\nKingsolver's extensive education in biology is on display in this book, laden with ecological concepts and biological facts. Her writing also exhibits her knowledge of rural Virginia, where she has lived for decades. In the acknowledgments Kingsolver thanks her Virginia friends and neighbors, as well as Fred Herbard of the American Chestnut Foundation.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Daily Telegraph reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the novel out of \"Love It\", \"Pretty Good\", \"Ok\", and \"Rubbish\": Daily Telegraph,  Independent, Sunday Telegraph, and New Statesman reviews under \"Love It\" and Guardian, Times, and Sunday Times reviews under \"Pretty Good\" and Literary Review and TLS reviews under \"Ok\".\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nProdigal Summer at the author's official site\nNew York Times review of Prodigal Summer\nScience & Film interview about film adaptation of Prodigal Summer\nThe idea of making a deal with the devil has appeared many times in works of popular culture. These pacts with the Devil can be found in many genres, including: books, music, comics, theater, movies, TV shows and games. When it comes to making a contract with the Devil, they all share the same prevailing desire, a mortal wants some worldly good for their own selfish gain, but in exchange, they must give up their soul for eternity.\nGenerally when Satan is depicted in these works, he is represented as a red-skinned man with horns or pointed ears on his head, hooves or bird-legs, a forked tail or one with a stinger, and a pitchfork. When trying to blend in or deceive somebody, often he is represented as a plain human being, and, in some instances, only his voice is heard.\nThe theme enjoyed a large run of popularity in the 20th century. At one point Anthony Boucher, editor of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, \"reported that fully 50 percent of his unsolicited submissions consisted of deal-with-the-devil stories or 'formalities of the hereafter', which as often as not involved the Devil\".\n\n\n== In print ==\nComic books\nBaron Mordo, story line in Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme (1988) #5.\nthe Black Panther, story line in Black Panther (1988) #3.\nCynthia von Doom, Mephisto helped Cynthia get revenge against her oppressors.\nDeath Note manga by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata; Light Yagami makes a pact with a Shinigami.\nDemon Candy: Parallel, an original English-language manga by Lord Dragon Master, Jonathan is tricked into selling his soul for a Klondike bar.\nDoctor Strange, story line in Doctor Strange: Damnation.\nthe Ghost Rider, story line beginning in Marvel Spotlight (1971) #5.\nJohn Constantine, Hellblazer story line Dangerous Habits: John Constantine cons the Lords of Hell into curing his lung cancer.\nKuroshitsuji or Black Butler, manga by Yana Toboso\nLoki, story line in Siege: Loki (2010) #1.\nMagik, her son was born in between multiple dimensions; to keep him safe, Magik made a deal with Mephisto.\nMagma, storyline in New Mutants (vol. 3) #30.\nthe Scarlet Witch, Wanda once used Mephisto's soul to create two children for herself.\nthe Silver Surfer, Mephisto tempts the Surfer with his heart's greatest desires.\nSpider-Man, story line in  One More Day, The Amazing Spider-Man (1999) #544.\nSusan Storm, story line in Give the Devil His Due.\nTeam Fortress 2, The Naked and the Dead\nX-23, the Red Hulk, the Ghost Rider and Venom, story line in Venom (2011) #13.\nNovels and short stories\n\nBearskin, fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm, in which a man gains a fortune and a bride by entering into a pact with the devil.\nThe Bet, by Anton Chekhov\nThe Black Spider (Die Schwarze Spinne; 1842), novella by Jeremias Gotthelf, (1842)\nThe Bottle Imp, by Robert Louis Stevenson, (1891)\nThe Demon Pope (1888), Madam Lucifer, short stories at Wikisource by Richard Garnett\nThe Devil and Daniel Webster, short story based on the Washington Irving story; by Stephen Vincent Ben\u00e9t\nThe Devil and Tom Walker by Washington Irving, (1824)\nThe Devil's Elixir, novel by E.

By land area the Congo is the second-largest country in Africa and the 11th-largest in the world. With a population of around 109 million, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the most populous Francophone country in the world. The national capital and largest city is Kinshasa, which is also the economic center. The country is bordered by the Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic, South Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania (across Lake Tanganyika), Zambia, Angola, the Cabinda exclave of Angola, and the South Atlantic Ocean.\nCentered on the Congo Basin, the territory of the Congo was first inhabited by Central African foragers around 90,000 years ago and was settled in the Bantu expansion about 3000 to 2000 years ago. In the west, the Kingdom of Kongo ruled around the mouth of the Congo River from the 14th to 19th centuries. In the center and east, the empires of Mwene Muji, Luba, and Lunda ruled from the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. King Leopold II of Belgium formally acquired rights to the Congo territory from the colonial nations of Europe in 1885 and declared the land his private property, naming it the Congo Free State. From 1885 to 1908, his colonial military forced the local population to produce rubber and committed widespread atrocities. In 1908, Leopold ceded the territory, which thus became a Belgian colony.\nCongo achieved independence from Belgium on 30 June 1960 and was immediately confronted by a series of secessionist movements, the assassination of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, and the seizure of power by Mobutu Sese Seko in a 1965 coup d'\u00e9tat. Mobutu renamed the country Zaire in 1971 and imposed a harsh personalist dictatorship until his overthrow in 1997 by the First Congo War. The country then had its name changed back and was confronted by the Second Congo War from 1998 to 2003, which resulted in the deaths of 5.4 million people and the assassination of President Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila. The war ended under President Joseph Kabila, who governed the country from 2001 to 2019 and under whom human rights in the country remained poor and included frequent abuses such as forced disappearances, torture, arbitrary imprisonment and restrictions on civil liberties.\nFollowing the 2018 general election, in the country's first peaceful transition of power since independence, Kabila was succeeded as president in a highly contentious election won by F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi, who has served as president since. Since 2015, eastern Congo has been the site of an ongoing military conflict.\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is extremely rich in natural resources but has suffered from political instability, a lack of infrastructure, corruption, and centuries of both commercial and colonial extraction and exploitation, followed by more than 60 years of independence, with little widespread development. Besides the capital Kinshasa, the two next largest cities, Lubumbashi and Mbuji-Mayi, are both mining communities. The DRC's largest export is raw minerals, with China accepting over 50% of its exports in 2019. In 2021, DR Congo's level of human development was ranked 179th out of 191 countries by the Human Development Index and is classed as a least developed country by the UN. As of 2018, following two decades of various civil wars and continued internal conflicts, around 600,000 Congolese refugees were still living in neighbouring countries. Two million children risk starvation, and the fighting has displaced 4.5 million people. The country is a member of the United Nations, Non-Aligned Movement, African Union, COMESA, Southern African Development Community, Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie, and Economic Community of Central African States.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is named after the C\nThe Bean Trees is the first novel by American writer Barbara Kingsolver. It was published in 1988 and reissued in 1998. The novel is followed by the sequel Pigs in Heaven.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\nTaylor Greer sets out to leave home, Kentucky, and travel west, and finds herself in Oklahoma near Cherokee territory. As Taylor stops in the town, a woman suddenly approaches, deposits a small child, and leaves without explanation. Not knowing what else to do, Taylor decides to care for the child. The two travel to Tucson, Arizona, where she meets Lou Ann, a woman with a young son. Lou Ann had been married; her husband abandoned her and their child.\nThe novel traces the experiences of Taylor and the child, whom Taylor names Turtle.\n\n\n== Setting ==\nThe story takes place in real places in North America, including Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Arizona. It begins when the main character, Taylor, leaves her home in Pittman, Kentucky to find herself. First, her car breaks down in the middle of Oklahoma, later in Tucson, Arizona. She travels back to Oklahoma and again to Arizona because of the people she became close with throughout the novel.\nBarbara Kingsolver's interest in nature is reflected in the Bean Trees, as it is full of descriptive landscapes and characters' passion towards the environment. The author uses history and biology to describe certain events or world issues related to nature.\n\n\n== Characters ==\nTaylor Greer, a native of Kentucky, is the protagonist and narrator of the novel. She is also known by her given name Marietta and nickname Missy. Taylor's personality is described as tough, adventurous, and independent throughout the novel.\nTurtle is the three-year-old child who is left with Taylor in Oklahoma.\nLou Ann lives in Tucson and has a baby named Dwayne Ray. She is also originally from Kentucky and is Taylor's roommate.\nEsperanza and Estevan are Guatemalan refugees that Taylor meets in Arizona.\nMattie is the owner of \"Jesus is Lord Used Tires.\" She grows vegetables and beans in her garden, which is filled with tire parts. Her home is a place where undocumented immigrants stay.\n\n\n== Major themes ==\nThe Bean Trees is a coming-of-age novel.\nBarbara Kingsolver uses a nonstandard perspective to share the characters' adventures and the world they live in. The use of nonwhite mythology, anti-western sentiment, and not using the typical form of male adventure, allowed the author to explore the world where women were powerful and had a voice.\nThe novel shares negative traumatic experiences of the characters and people they meet, like Native Americans and Guatemalan refugees. While those scenes demonstrate qualities like sympathy and concern, they contribute to the overall spirit of the story being positive and uplifting.\nThe protagonist is raised by a single mother, which helps to develop themes of motherhood and nontraditional family values throughout the story, as Taylor, herself becomes Turtle's parent. The novel further explores nontraditional extended family through the relationships between the members of the community. It conveys the idea of interdependence and interaction, community's importance to each individual's life, and balance between independence and a sense of belonging. It also addresses the issue of parenthood through adoption. The novel makes reference to the issue of Native American parental rights as well.\nThe Bean Trees also portrays the effects of child abuse.\nIt portrays undocumented immigration from Latin America as some characters facilitate immigrants' escape from persecution.\nThemes of love and nurturing emerge from the violence and poverty that the characters face. The book conveys multiple symbolic meanings about shared motherhood, life and death, and beauty. The underlying themes not always recognized include those about mockery toward the judicial system, the flawed coping strategies of current-day issues, and the strength of friendship.\n\n\n== Style ==\nJack Butler wrote for the New York Times, \"The Bean Trees is\nFlight Behavior is a 2012 novel by Barbara Kingsolver. It is her seventh novel, a New York Times bestseller, and was declared \"Best book of the year\" by the Washington Post and USA Today.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\nDellarobia Turnbow is a 28-year-old discontented housewife living with her poor family on a farm in Appalachia. On a hike to begin an affair with a telephone repairman, Turnbow finds millions of monarch butterflies in the valley behind her home.\nAs the news of her discovery spreads, university professor Ovid Byron arrives to study the monarchs, and warns that although they are beautiful, they are a disturbing symptom of global climate change, displaced from their established winter habitat in Mexico, and that they may not survive the harsh Tennessee winter.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nAccording to Book Marks, the book received a \"positive\" consensus, based on fourteen critic reviews: five \"rave\", five \"positive\", one \"mixed\", and three \"pan\". On The Omnivore, a British aggregator of press reviews, the book received an \"omniscore\" of 3.5 out of 5. Culture Critic assessed critical response as an aggregated score of 88% based on an accumulation of British and American press reviews. On January/February 2013 issue of Bookmarks, the book received a  (3.5 out of 5) based on critic reviews with a summary saying, \"Although a hot-button issue is never far from center stage here, readers who enjoy settling in with an old pro and spending time with likable, realistically flawed characters will again find an able guide in Kingsolver\".\n\nWriting in UK Sunday newspaper The Observer, Robin McKie found, \"In general, Flight Behaviour is an impressive work. It is complex, elliptical and well-observed. Dellarobia and her kin come over as solid but believable individuals, outlined with respect and balance. Even Cub, her much put-upon simpleton of a husband, and his dreadful, manipulative mother Hester, are ultimately accorded sympathy\". McKie was less impressed with Kingsolver's portrayal, \"almost to the point of overkill\", of the Turnbow family's poverty. \"However\", he added, \"it is the issue of climate change that hangs, unspoken, over proceedings\", and concluded by saying, \"[...] Kingsolver makes her message clear. If only a few more scientists started screaming on TV and radio then we might have a chance to avoid the worst of the calamities that lie ahead\".\nIn The Daily Telegraph, Beth Jones noted that, \"Kingsolver has carved a career from examining social issues in her novels, from economic inequality to racism. In Flight Behaviour, it's the causes and consequences of climate change that form the novel's core. As lepidopterist Ovid Bryon shouts: 'For God's sake\u2026 the damn globe is catching fire and the islands are drowning. The evidence is staring [you] in the face'\". Jones found that, \"[...] in Flight Behaviour she once again manages to make a global crisis seem relevant through tiny domestic details\", before concluding that, \"The result is a compelling plot with lyrical passages and flashes of humour. Absorbing and entertaining, Flight Behaviour engages the reader in the quotidian details of Dellarobia's life, while insisting that we never forget the crumbling world beneath her, and our, feet\".\n\nReviewing the book in The New York Times, Dominique Browning wrote of \"the intricate tapestry of Barbara Kingsolver's majestic and brave new novel\", adding, \"Her subject is both intimate and enormous, centered on one woman, one family, one small town no one has ever heard of \u2014 until Dellarobia stumbles into a life-altering journey of conscience. How do we live, Kingsolver asks, and with what consequences, as we hurtle toward the abyss in these times of epic planetary transformation? And make no mistake about it, the stakes are that high. Postapocalyptic times, and their singular preoccupation with survival, look easy compared with this journey to the end game. Yet we must also deal with the pinching boots of everyday life.

It recognizes distinguished fiction by an American author, preferably dealing with American life, published during the preceding calendar year. \nAs the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel (awarded 1918\u20131947), it was one of the original Pulitzers; the program was inaugurated in 1917 with seven prizes, four of which were awarded that year  (no Novel prize was awarded in 1917, the first one having been granted in 1918).\nThe name was changed to the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1948, and eligibility was expanded to also include short stories, novellas, novelettes, and poetry, as well as novels.\nFinalists have been announced since 1980, usually a total of three.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nAs defined in the original Plan of Award, the prize was given \"Annually, for the American novel published during the year which shall best present the wholesome atmosphere of American life, and the highest standard of American manners and manhood,\" although there was some struggle over whether the word wholesome should be used instead of whole, the word Pulitzer had written in his will. In 1927, the advisory board quietly instituted Pulitzer's word choice, replacing wholesome with whole.\nWith 1929 came the first of several much more substantive changes. The board changed the wording to \"preferably one which shall best present the whole atmosphere of American life\" and deleted the insistence that the novel portray \"the highest standard of American manners and manhood\". In 1936, emphasis was changed again, with the award going to \"a distinguished novel published during the year by an American author, preferably dealing with American life\". In 1948, the advisory board widened the scope of the award with the wording \"For distinguished fiction published in book form during the year by an American author, preferably dealing with American life.\" This change allowed the prize to go to a collection of short stories for the first time, James Michener's Tales of the South Pacific.\n\n\n== Winners ==\nIn 31 years under the \"Novel\" name, the prize was awarded 27 times; in its first 76 years to 2023 under the \"Fiction\" name, 69 times. There have been 11 years during which no title received the award. It was shared by two authors for the first time in 2023. Since this category's inception in 1918, 31 women have won the prize. Four authors have won two prizes each in the Fiction category: Booth Tarkington, William Faulkner, John Updike, and Colson Whitehead.\nBecause the award is for books published in the preceding calendar year, the \"Year\" column links to the preceding year in literature.\n\n\n=== 1910s to 1970s ===\n\n\n=== 1980s to 2020s ===\nEntries from this point on include the finalists listed for each year.\n\n\n== Repeat winners ==\nFour writers to date have won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction multiple times, one nominally in the novel category and two in the general fiction category.

They form a subset of third culture kids (TCKs). The term is more specifically applied when these children return to their \"home\" or passport country (the country of their citizenship), and often experience various difficulties identifying with fellow citizens and integrating \"back\" into their \"home\" culture. The resulting feeling is described as \"reverse culture shock\".\nThere is some confusion between the terms MK and TCK. According to the definition developed by Ruth Hill Useem, TCKs are people who have spent a significant part of their developmental years outside their parents' culture. TCK is a broad term that encompasses all children who have grown up abroad (i.e. military kids, diplomats' kids, immigrants). Missionary kids are just one of the many categories of kids who qualify as TCKs. Therefore, while all MKs are TCKs, not all TCKs are MKs.\nIn the past MKs usually were almost exclusively American or European, but there is as of 2014 a growing number of MKs from other countries, especially Protestant Christian MKs from South Korea and from Latin America. Generally, this term applies to Protestant Christians; however, it can be applied to any denomination of a religion.\n\n\n== Definition ==\n\n\n=== Life overseas ===\nWhile MKs often identify more with the culture or country where they were raised (and this could be multiple cities, countries, or continents) than with where their parents were raised, they are not fully at home in any one culture. David C. Pollock and Van Reken attribute this feeling of displacement, or rootlessness, to a lack of emotional connection to their home culture (where they \"should\" feel connected). Many MKs find it difficult to answer questions about where they are from or where home is as they may feel more of an emotional connection to their host culture than to their \"home\" culture. However, at the same time many MKs are completely aware that they can never fully fit into their host culture. This is especially obvious to MKs growing up in countries where they look different from the local population. Pollock and Van Reken developed the PolVan Cultural Identity Model to explain cultural identity in relationship to the surrounding culture. The Model names four categories into which a person can fall based on how they look and think compared to the culture around them:\n\nForeigner\nlook different, think different\nAdopted\nlook different, think alike\nHidden Immigrant\nlook alike, think different\nMirror\nlook alike, think alike\nWhen MKs first transition to their new or \"host\" culture, they are in the foreigner category. As they continue the transition and begin to acclimate and feel at home in their host culture, MKs move into the adopted category, often to the point where MKs feel more at home in the host culture than in their passport culture. At this point, the host culture becomes the MK's home culture. Upon returning to their passport culture, MKs often find themselves in the hidden immigrant category. Because they look like their peers, their extended family remembers how they were prior to their international move and expect them to hold similar views and to act as a typical citizen of that passport country would act. However, as hidden immigrants, MKs look like their family and friends, but more often than not hold many differing views and opinions. Additionally, MKs may not be aware of many of the pop culture influences within their passport country, yet are aware of world and regional issues, which most citizens of their passport country are unaware of. This cultural disconnect can cause awkwardness when they return to their passport country.\nChildren in the MKs' passport countries often find it difficult to relate to missionary children, and vice versa. While MKs may find the lives of their peers in their passport countries to be boring, sometimes creating challengi\nPigs in Heaven (ISBN 9780060168018) is a 1993 novel by Barbara Kingsolver; it is the sequel to her first novel, The Bean Trees.  It continues the story of Taylor Greer and Turtle, her adopted Cherokee daughter. It highlights the strong relationships between mothers and daughters, with special attention given to the customs, history, and present living situation of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma. It is Kingsolver's first book to appear on the New York Times Best Seller list.\nThe New York Times Book Review praised Kingsolver's \"extravagantly gifted narrative voice\" and called the novel a \"resounding achievement\".\n\n\n== References ==\nThe Women's Prize for Fiction (previously called Orange Prize for Fiction (1996\u20132006 & 2009\u201312), Orange Broadband Prize for Fiction (2007\u20132008) and Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction (2014\u20132017)) is one of the United Kingdom's most prestigious literary prizes, annually awarded to a female author of any nationality for the best original full-length novel written in English, and published in the United Kingdom in the preceding year. The prize was originally due to be launched in 1994 with the support of Mitsubishi but public controversy over the merits of the award caused the sponsorship to be withdrawn. Funding from Orange, a UK mobile network operator and Internet service provider, allowed the prize to be launched in 1996 by a committee of male and female \"journalists, reviewers, agents, publishers, librarians, booksellers\", including current Honorary Director Kate Mosse.\nIn May 2012, it was announced that Orange would be ending its sponsorship of the prize. In 2012, the award was formally known as the \"Women's Prize for Fiction\", and was sponsored by \"private benefactors\" led by Cherie Blair and writers Joanna Trollope and Elizabeth Buchan. In 2013, the new sponsor became Baileys. In January 2017 the company announced that it was the last year that they would sponsor the prize. In June 2017, the prize announced it would change its name to simply \"Women's Prize for Fiction\" starting in 2018, and will be supported by a family of sponsors.\nThe prize was established to recognise the contribution of female writers, whom Mosse believed were often overlooked in other major literary awards, and in reaction to the all-male shortlist for the 1991 Booker Prize. The winner of the prize receives \u00a330,000, along with a bronze sculpture called the Bessie created by artist Grizel Niven, the sister of actor and writer David Niven. Typically, a longlist of nominees is announced around March each year, followed by a shortlist in June; within days the winner is announced. The winner is selected by a board of \"five leading women\" each year. In 2005, judges named Andrea Levy's Small Island as the \"Orange of Oranges\", the best novel of the preceding decade.\nThe BBC suggests that the prize forms part of the \"trinity\" of UK literary prizes, along with the Booker Prize and the Costa Book Awards; the sales of works by the nominees of these awards are significantly boosted. Levy's 2004 winning book sold almost one million copies (in comparison to less than 600,000 for the Booker Prize winner of the same year), while sales of Helen Dunmore's A Spell of Winter quadrupled after being awarded the inaugural prize. Valerie Martin's 2003 award saw her novel sales increase tenfold after the award, and British libraries, who often support the prize with various promotions, reported success in introducing people to new authors: \"48% said that they had tried new writers as a result of the promotion, and 42% said that they would try other books by the new authors they had read.\"\nHowever, the fact that the prize singles out female writers is not without controversy. After the prize was founded, Auberon Waugh nicknamed it the \"Lemon Prize\" while Germaine Greer claimed there would soon be a prize for \"writers with red hair\". Winner of the 1990 Booker Prize, A. S. Byatt, called it a \"sexist prize\", claiming \"such a prize was never needed.\" In 1999, the chairwoman of the judges, Lola Young, said that the British fiction they were asked to appraise fell into two categories, either \"insular and parochial\" or \"domestic in a piddling kind of way\", unlike American authors who \"take small, intimate stories and set them against this vast physical and cultural landscape which is very appealing.\" Linda Grant suffered accusations of plagiarism following her award in 2000, while the following year, a panel of male critics produced their own shortlist and heavily criticised the genuine shortlist. Though full of praise for the winner of the 2007 prize, the chair of the judging panel M\nUnsheltered is a 2018 novel by Barbara Kingsolver published by HarperCollins.

Ilana Masad states in her NPR review that by the end of the novel \"Kingsolver doesn't give us solutions, but she reminds us to take comfort in one another when we can, and that hope is necessary even when all seems lost.\" Benjamin Evans' review in The Guardian notes, \"Unlike the incompetent architect of the house in her latest book, Unsheltered, American novelist Barbara Kingsolver has proved herself a supreme craftsperson over the past three decades. She possesses a knack for ingenious metaphors that encapsulate the social questions at the heart of her stories.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Unsheltered\" at Barbara Kingsolver's authorized website\nHigh Tide in Tucson: Essays from Now or Never is a 1995 book of 25 essays by author Barbara Kingsolver exploring ideas such as family, community, ecology and social consciousness. It is titled after the first essay, in which she realizes that a hermit crab she accidentally brought home while beachcombing in the Bahamas still times its activity to the rise and fall of the tides, even in an aquarium in Tucson, Arizona. The crab is a metaphor for a situation in her own life.\n\n\n== References ==\nOprah's Book Club was a book discussion club segment of the American talk show The Oprah Winfrey Show, highlighting books chosen by host Oprah Winfrey. Winfrey started the book club in 1996, selecting a new book, usually a novel, for viewers to read and discuss each month. In total, the club recommended 70 books during its 15 years.\nDue to the book club's widespread popularity, many obscure titles have become very popular bestsellers, increasing sales in some cases by as many as several million copies. Al Greco, a Fordham University marketing professor, estimated the total sales of the 70 \"Oprah editions\" at over 55 million copies.\nThe club has seen several literary controversies, such as Jonathan Franzen's public dissatisfaction with his novel, The Corrections, having been chosen by Winfrey, and the incident of James Frey's memoir, A Million Little Pieces, being outed as almost entirety fabricated. The latter controversy resulted in Frey and publisher Nan Talese being confronted and publicly shamed by Winfrey in a highly praised live televised episode of Winfrey's show.\nOn June 1, 2012, Oprah announced the launch of Oprah's Book Club 2.0 with Wild by Cheryl Strayed. The new version of Oprah's Book Club, a joint project between OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network and O, The Oprah Magazine, incorporates the use of various social media platforms and e-readers.\nOn March 25, 2019, Apple Inc. and Oprah announced a revival of Oprah's Book Club that aired on Apple TV+.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe book club's first selection on September 17, 1996, was the then recently published novel The Deep End of the Ocean by Jacquelyn Mitchard. Winfrey discontinued the book club for one year in 2002, stating that she could not keep up with the required reading while still searching for contemporary novels that she enjoyed. After its revival in 2003, books were selected on a more limited basis (three or four a year).\nWinfrey returned to fiction with her 2007 selections of The Road by Cormac McCarthy in March and Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides in June. Shortly after its being chosen, The Road was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Winfrey conducted the first ever television interview with McCarthy, a famously reclusive author, on June 5, 2007.\nThe October 2007 selection was Love in the Time of Cholera, a 1985 novel by Nobel Prize laureate Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, greatly furthering not only the influence of the author in North America, but that of his translator Edith Grossman. Another work by M\u00e1rquez, One Hundred Years of Solitude, was a previous selection for the book club in 2004.\nThe last club selection was a special edition of Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities and Great Expectations. It had disappointingly low sales figures.\n\n\n== Influence ==\nIn Reading with Oprah: The Book Club That Changed America, Kathleen Rooney describes Winfrey as \"a serious American intellectual who pioneered the use of electronic media, specifically television and the Internet, to take reading\u2014a decidedly non-technological and highly individual act\u2014and highlight its social elements and uses in such a way to motivate millions of erstwhile non-readers to pick up books.\"\nBusiness Week stated:\n\nPerhaps the most astonishing aspect of the Oprah phenomenon is how outsized her power is compared with that of other market movers. Some observers suggest that Jon Stewart of Comedy Central's The Daily Show could be No. 2. Other proven arm-twisters include Fox News's Sean Hannity, National Public Radio's Terry Gross, radio personality Don Imus, and CBS' 60 Minutes. But no one comes close to Oprah's clout: Publishers estimate that her power to sell a book is anywhere from 20 to 100 times that of any other media personality.\nIn 2009, it was reported that the influence of Winfrey's book club had even spread to Brazil, with picks like A New Earth dominating Brazil's best-seller list.\nThe club generated so much success for some books that they went on to be adapted into films.

It is Kingsolver's sixth novel, and won the 2010 Orange Prize for Fiction and the Library of Virginia Literary Award. It was shortlisted for the 2011 International Dublin Literary Award. Kingsolver won the 2010 Women's Prize for Fiction for the novel.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe novel tells the story of Harrison William Shepherd beginning with his childhood in Mexico during the 1930s. His parents are separated so he lives back and forth between the United States with his father and Mexico with his mother. During his time in Mexico he works as a plaster mixer for the mural artist Diego Rivera then as a cook for both him and his artist wife Frida Kahlo, with whom Shepherd develops a lifelong friendship. While living with and working for them, he also begins working as a secretary for Leon Trotsky who is hiding there, exiled by Stalin, and witnesses his assassination.\nHe accompanies some of Kahlo's paintings to Washington DC where he witnesses the shootings of the Bonus Army. He then moves to Asheville, North Carolina, where he writes successful historical novels set in Mexico. However he is investigated by the House Un-American Activities Committee, and after he is vilified by the press he returns to Mexico, taking his secretary, Violet Brown, with him. He disappears while swimming off the Pacific coast and is presumed dead. However Brown, the chief beneficiary of his will, later receives a letter from Kahlo hinting that he has survived, by swimming underwater along a lava tube which emerges inland in a cenote.\nHe had instructed Brown to burn his diaries and letterspapers, but she secretly saves them and it is these papers that form the bulk of the novel. There are gaps, or lacunae, in the story, hence the title.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAccording to Book Marks, the book received a \"mixed\" consensus, based on thirteen critic reviews: three \"rave\", four \"positive\", four \"mixed\", and two \"pan\". On The Omnivore, a British aggregator of press reviews, the book received an \"omniscore\" of 3.5 out of 5. Culture Critic assessed critical response as an aggregated score of 85% based on an accumulation of British and American press reviews. The book received a 75% from The Lit Review based on thirty-three critic reviews. On September/October 2010 issue of Bookmarks, the book received a  (4.0 out of 5) based on critic reviews with a summary saying, \"However, the novel's compelling, engrossing story certainly outweighed these minor complaints, and in the end, Kingsolver has created a convincing \"tableau vivant of epochs and people that time has transformed almost past recognition\" (New York Times Book Review)\".\n\n\n== References ==\nAnimal Dreams is a 1990 novel by Barbara Kingsolver. A woman named Cosima \"Codi\" Noline returns to her hometown of Grace, Arizona to help her aging father, who is slowly losing his struggle with Alzheimer's disease. She takes a biology teacher position at the local high school and lives with her old high school friend, Emelina. Animal Dreams features Kingsolver's trademark\u2014alternating perspectives throughout the novel. Most chapters are told from the perspective of Codi, while others are told from her father, Homer's, perspective. The book was dedicated to Ben Linder, who was killed by the Contras on April 28, 1987.\nThe novel features some Hispanic and Native American themes.  Codi's sister, Halimeda \"Hallie\", moves to Nicaragua to teach local people more sustainable farming techniques. Another political theme in the novel is the small town's fight against the Black Mountain Mining Company, which pollutes the river water and nearly destroys the citizens' orchard trees, Grace's primary economic livelihood.\nIn addition to political themes like these, many of Kingsolver's novels also feature images and themes from biology. Animal Dreams is rich with natural imagery and the study of the created world. And, as with most Kingsolver novels, this one is laced with genial humor.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nWriting in the New York Times Jane Smiley has some reservations about the novel \"Ms. Kingsolver has chosen to explore Codi's despair, and in doing so she frequently undermines the suspense and the weight of her book. First-person narration can be tricky, and Ms. Kingsolver falls into its trap: Codi comes across too often as a whiner, observant of others but invariably more concerned with her own state of mind.\" Smiley concludes that Kingsolver \"demonstrates a special gift for the vivid evocation of landscape and of her characters' state of mind. That she leaves open spaces, that she doesn't quite integrate everything into a perfect system, is probably to her credit.\"\nKirkus Reviews says \"Kingsolver has political conviction, a wonderful eye for the surface of things and many charming poetic conceits,\nbut here her characters seem constructed rather than real. A promising miss.\"\nMargaret Randall of the Los Angeles Times is positive \"As I read the last few pages of Animal Dreams, I felt a brief moment of panic. Would this book really end as it seemed it was going to? Suddenly the outcome I had hoped for unwound before my grateful eyes. Things happened as I wanted them to, as I breathed a sigh of relief. This neat wrap-up may be the single flaw in an otherwise exceptionally crafted narrative. Most important for me, however, is my conviction that Kingsolver is giving a new voice to our literature, one that fulfills its promise even as it begins its journey: four books in as many years.\"\n\n\n== Awards ==\nPen/USA West Fiction Award\nEdward Abbey Award for Ecofiction\nNamed an American Library Association Notable Book, the Arizona Library Association Book of the Year, and a New York Times Notable Book.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nAnimal Dreams on Barbara Kingsolver's website Archived 2018-04-06 at the Wayback Machine\nAnimal Dreams book", "metadata": {"title": "The Poisonwood Bible", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Poisonwood_Bible"}}
