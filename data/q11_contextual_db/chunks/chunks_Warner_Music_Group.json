        "content": "Warner Music Group Corp., commonly abbreviated as WMG, is an American multinational entertainment and record label conglomerate headquartered in New York City. It is one of the \"big three\" recording companies and the third-largest in the global music industry, after Universal Music Group (UMG) and Sony Music Entertainment (SME). Formerly part of Time Warner (later known as WarnerMedia, now Warner Bros. Discovery), WMG was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange from 2005 until 2011, when it announced its privatization and sale to Access Industries. It later had its second IPO on Nasdaq in 2020, once again becoming a public company. With a multibillion-dollar annual turnover, WMG employs more than 4,500 people and has operations in more than 50 countries throughout the world.\nThe company owns and operates some of the largest and most successful labels in the world, including Elektra Records, Reprise Records, Warner Records, Parlophone Records (previously owned by EMI), and Atlantic Records. WMG also owns Warner Chappell Music, one of the world's largest music publishers.\nSince August 2, 2018, WMG has expanded its business to digital media operations through its acquisition of Uproxx.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1950s and 1960s ===\nThe film studio Warner Bros. had no record label division at the time one of its contracted actors, Tab Hunter, scored a No. 1 hit song in 1957 for Dot Records, a division of rival Paramount Pictures. In order to prevent any repetition of its actors recording for rival companies, and to also capitalize on the music business, Warner Bros. Records was created in 1958; its original office was located above the film studio's machine shop on 3701 Warner Boulevard in Burbank, California. In 1963, Warner purchased Reprise Records, which had been founded by Frank Sinatra three years earlier so that he could have more creative control over his recordings. With the Reprise acquisition, Warner gained the services of Mo Ostin, who was mainly responsible for the success of Warner/Reprise.\nAfter Warner Bros. was sold to Seven Arts Productions in 1967 (forming Warner Bros.-Seven Arts), it purchased Atlantic Records, founded in 1947 and WMG's oldest label (until WMG completed its acquisition of Parlophone in 2013), as well as its subsidiary Atco Records. This acquisition brought Neil Young into the company fold, initially as a member of Buffalo Springfield. Young became one of Warner's longest-established artists, recording both as a solo artist and with groups under the Warner-owned Atlantic, Atco, and Reprise labels. Young also recorded five albums for Geffen Records during that label's period of Warner distribution. The Geffen catalogue, now owned by Universal Music Group, represents Young's only major recordings not under WMG ownership.\nAtlantic, its subsidiary Atco Records, and its affiliate Stax Records paved the way for Warner's rise to industry prominence. The purchase brought in Atlantic's lucrative back catalogue, which included classic recordings by Ray Charles, the Drifters, the Coasters, and many more. In the mid-1960s, Atlantic/Stax released a string of landmark soul music recordings by artists including Booker T & the MGs, Sam & Dave, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, Ben E. King, and Aretha Franklin. Ultimately, the sale led to Stax leaving Atlantic because Seven Arts Productions insisted on keeping the rights to Stax recordings. Atlantic moved decisively into rock and pop in the late 1960s and 1970s, signing major British and American acts including Led Zeppelin, Cream, Crosby Stills & Nash, Yes, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Genesis, Average White Band, Dr. John, King Crimson, Bette Midler, Roxy Music, and Foreigner.\nIn 1969, two years after being purchased by Seven Arts, the Warner Bros.-Seven Arts company was sold to the Kinney National Company. In mid-1972, Kinney Music of Canada, Ltd. was renamed WEA Music of Canada, Ltd. (French: WEA Musique du Canada, Ltée) as the Canadian branch of the WEA (Warner, El\nWarner Music Group (WMG) owns, has a joint share, or is associated with the record labels listed here.\n\n\n== Flagship labels ==\nAtlantic Records\nElektra Records\nParlophone Records\nWarner Records\n\n\n== Atlantic Music Group ==\n\n\n== 300 Elektra Entertainment ==\n\n300 Entertainment\nElektra Records\nAsylum Records (back catalog)\nEastWest Records America (back catalog)\nBlack Cement\nDCD2 Records\nDTA Records\nFueled by Ramen\nLow Country Sound\nRoadrunner Records\nPublic Consumption Recording Co.\n\n\n== Warner Records ==\n\n\n== Parlophone Label Group ==\n\nParlophone Records, including reissues from the back catalogs of:\nChrysalis Records (UK, part)\nEMI Columbia Records\nEMI Records (UK)\nHarvest Records (UK)\nRegal Recordings\nFFRR Records\nKling Klang Produkt\nMarv Music (joint-venture with film production company Marv Studios)\nPink Floyd Records (British and European distribution only)\nStateside Records (British distribution only)\nTop Rank Records\n\n\n== Rhino Entertainment ==\n\nAtco Records\nBearsville Records\nDel-Fi Records\nEleven: A Music Company\nJubilee Records\nRhino Records\nRoulette Records\nTK Records\nRhino handles the American distribution of reissues from the UK back catalogs of Chrysalis (part), EMI Columbia, EMI, Harvest, and Parlophone.\n\n\n== Alternative Distribution Alliance ==\n\n\n== Arts Music ==\nSesame Street Records\nFirst Night Records\nMattel Music\nSh-K-Boom Records\n\n\n== Warner Classics ==\n\nWarner Classics Records (incorporating EMI Classics and Angel Records)\nErato Records (incorporating Virgin Classics)\nTeldec Records\nElektra Nonesuch Records\nFinlandia Records\nLontano Records\nWarner Apex\nWarner Elatus\nWarner Fonit Records\nNVC Arts Records\n\n\n== Warner Music Nashville ==\nAtlantic Records Nashville\nWarner Records Nashville\nElektra Records Nashville\nMarcus Music\n\n\n== International labels ==\n\n\n=== Warner Music International ===\nWarner Music International (formerly WEA International) is the international copyright holder and distributor for North American artists on the Warner Music record labels.

Records, Inc. for the U.S. and WEA International, Inc. for the world outside the U.S.\"\nWEA is also referred to as Warner Music International or Warner Music Entertainment and has divisions worldwide such as Australia, Japan and all over Europe. These branches are usually called Warner Music followed by the name of the country. Some labels have more than one record company for example the UK has Warner Bros. Records UK and Atlantic Records UK but both trade through Warner Music UK, Limited.

In 1929, Warner Bros. acquired M. Witmark & Sons, Remick Music Corporation and Harms, Inc. Tamerlane Music was acquired in 1969.\nWarner Chappell Music was formed in San Antonio, Texas, in 1987, when Warner Music Group Chairman Chuck Kaye led the company to purchase Chappell & Co. from PolyGram (now Universal Music Group) (UMG). In 1988, Warner-Chappell acquired Birch Tree Group (formerly Summy Birchard), publisher of Happy Birthday to You, and the Frances Clark piano method books. In 1990, Warner Chappell acquired Mighty Three Music, the publishing company of Thom Bell and Gamble and Huff. The same year, Warner Chappell acquired the Canadian music publisher Gordon V. Thompson Music.\nIn 1994, Warner Bros. Publications expanded its print music operations by acquiring CPP/Belwin. CPP/Belwin had been the former print music arm of Columbia Pictures.\nIn 2005, Warner Chappell Music sold most of its printed music division, Warner Bros. Publications, to Alfred Publishing, and in 2006 launched the Pan European Digital Licensing (P.E.D.L.) initiative. In 2007, when Radiohead released In Rainbows through its website on a pay-what-you-wish model, Warner Chappell Music created a streamlined, one-of-a-kind licensing process for the songs on the album that allowed rights users around the world to secure use of the music from a single location.\nIn 2006, David H. Johnson was elevated to interim CEO and then in 2007 to Chairman & CEO of the company.\nIn November 2006, Disney Music Publishing and Warner Chappell agreed to a licensing agreement for Europe and South America major markets.\nIn 2007, the company acquired Non-Stop Music. Additionally, in 2010 it acquired 615 Music, a Nashville-based production music company, and subsequently united all the production music companies under the name Warner Chappell Production Music in 2012. In 2011, it acquired Southside Independent Music Publishing, whose songwriters included Bruno Mars, Brody Brown, and J.R. Rotem. In July 2012, Warner/Chappell purchased the music rights of the film studio Miramax Films.\nIt was ranked in 2010 by Music & Copyright as the world's third-largest music publisher. Among the songs in the company's library are \"Winter Wonderland\" and formerly \"Happy Birthday to You\" until the copyright of the song was invalidated in 2015 and put in the public domain the next year.\nIn January 2011, Cameron Strang, founder of New West Records and Southside Independent Music Publishing, was named CEO of Warner Chappell Music.  He was succeeded by former company president Jon Platt in 2016.\nWarner Chappell acquired Frank Gari's studio in 2015, adding to its production music library some of the most well-known television news music themes including those for local stations owned by ABC, CBS, and NBC.\nOn June 30, 2017, Warner Chappell Music filed a lawsuit against EMI Music Publishing, accusing the latter company of underpaying Warner Music for the royalties of the 20th Century Fox catalogue, which Warner acquired in 1982, as well as the rights to Curtis Mayfield and Kool and the Gang. This controversy arises from EMI's acquisition of Robbins and Feist in the early 1990s.\nOn January 9, 2019, Guy Moot was named CEO of Warner Chappell Music.  He and Carianne Marshall, the company's COO, were appointed co-chairs.\nOn January 15, 2019, Warner Chappell Music filed a monetization claim against a fanfilm created by Star Wars YouTube channel Star Wars Theory, but rescinded the claim two days later after intervention by Lucasfilm Ltd. on behalf of outraged fans.

(known as Warner Bros. Records Inc. until 2019) is an American record label.  A subsidiary of the Warner Music Group, it is headquartered in Los Angeles, California. It was founded on March 19, 1958, as the recorded music division of the American film studio Warner Bros.\nArtists who have recorded for Warner Records include  Madonna, Prince, Linkin Park, Zach Bryan, Van Halen, Kylie Minogue, ZZ Top, Gorillaz, Bette Midler, Grateful Dead, Jane's Addiction, Duran Duran, Fleetwood Mac, Rod Stewart, Funkadelic, James Taylor,  Red Hot Chili Peppers, Mac Miller, R.E.M., Bob James, David Sanborn, and the Sex Pistols.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\nAt the end of the silent movie period, Warner Bros. Pictures decided to expand into publishing and recording so that it could access low-cost music content for its films. In 1928, the studio acquired several smaller music publishing firms which included M. Witmark & Sons, Harms Inc., and a partial interest in New World Music Corp., and merged them to form the Music Publishers Holding Company. This new group controlled valuable copyrights on standards by George and Ira Gershwin and Jerome Kern, and the new division was soon earning solid profits of up to US$2 million every year.\nIn 1930, Music Publishers Holding Company (MPHC) paid US$28 million to acquire Brunswick Records (which included Vocalion), whose roster included Duke Ellington, Red Nichols, Nick Lucas, Al Jolson, Earl Burtnett, Ethel Waters, Abe Lyman, Leroy Carr, Tampa Red and Memphis Minnie, and soon after the sale to Warner Bros., the label signed rising radio and recording stars Bing Crosby, Mills Brothers, and Boswell Sisters. Unfortunately for Warner Bros., the dual impact of the Great Depression and the introduction of broadcast radio greatly harmed the recording industry—sales crashed, dropping by around 90% from more than 100 million records in 1927 to fewer than 10 million by 1932 and major companies were forced to halve the price of records from 75 to 35 cents.\nIn December 1931, Warner Bros. offloaded Brunswick to the American Record Corporation (ARC) for a fraction of its former value, in a lease arrangement which did not include Brunswick's pressing plants. Technically, Warner maintained actual ownership of Brunswick, which with the sale of ARC to CBS in 1939 and their decision to discontinue Brunswick in favor of reviving the Columbia label, reverted to Warner Bros. Warner Bros. sold Brunswick a second time (along with Brunswick's back catalog up to 1931) in 1941, this time along with the old Brunswick pressing plants Warner owned, to Decca Records (which formed its American operations in 1934) in exchange for a financial interest in Decca. The heavy loss it incurred in the Brunswick deal kept the studio out of the record business for almost 20 years, and during this period it licensed its film music to other companies for release as soundtrack albums.\n\n\n=== 1958–1963: formation and early years ===\n  \nWarner Bros. returned to the record business on March 19, 1958, with the establishment of its own recording division, Warner Bros. Records. By this time, the established Hollywood studios were reeling from multiple challenges to their former dominance—the most notable being the introduction of television in the late 1940s. Legal changes also had a major impact on their business—lawsuits brought by major stars had effectively overthrown the old studio contract system by the late 1940s and, beginning in 1949, anti-trust suits brought by the U.S. government forced the five major studios to divest their cinema chains.\nIn 1956, Harry Warner and Albert Warner sold their interest in the studio and the board was joined by new members who favored a renewed expansion into the music business—Charles Allen of the investment bank Charles Allen & Company, Serge Semenenko of the First National Bank of Boston and investor David Baird. Semenenko in particular had a strong professional interest in the entertainment \nWarner Bros. Discovery is an American multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate based in New York City.

He later founded his own independent imprint, Ultimate Dilemma, and became the head of Rawkus Records' operations outside North America. In 2002, he was appointed head of A&R at Mushroom Records UK, which was acquired by Warner Music Group and became part of Atlantic Records UK. He became the CEO of Recorded Music at Warner Music Group in 2017.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMax Lousada grew up in Tooting Bec, South London, England, and went to Elliott School in Putney. His mother was a photographer, and his father was a social worker and political activist. As a child, Lousada would spend his Saturdays selling newspapers of the Socialist Workers Party near Elephant and Castle. He later enrolled at University of Brighton but left after six months.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nLousada became involved in the emerging dance music scene in Brighton, frequenting places like the Jazz Rooms or The Zap, and organizing club nights. He later started his own distribution and management company, called In A Silent Way, with four of his friends. Named after a Miles Davis album, In A Silent Way was a fashion and music collective which imported and exported records for DJs and independent outlets. Through a network of labels and shops, Lousada imported and sold a variety of products ranging from French hip-hop vinyl records to Adidas trainers.\nLousada then worked for several small independent record labels and shops before forming his own independent imprint, Ultimate Dilemma. He was also appointed by Rawkus Records founders Brian Brater and Jarret Myer to lead the New York-based label's operations outside of North America. At Rawkus, Lousada was able to work with artists such as Mos Def and garner airplay for \"Ms. Fat Booty\" on BBC Radio 1. While operating independently, Rawkus Records was at the time funded by News International and partnered with Mushroom Records UK.\nMushroom Records UK also began funding Lousada's own label, Ultimate Dilemma, and he moved his operations from the Old Truman Brewery, where Rawkus Records UK was the first record label tenant, to Mushroom Records UK's studios in Fulham.

Along with Ross himself, the label signed its first two acts that same year; its first was the hip hop group of which Ross was a member, Triple C's (alongside Gunplay, Torch, and Young Breed), while its second, singer Masspike Miles was signed in November of that year. The label released its first major album, Deeper Than Rap by Ross in April 2009. The Triple C's debut album, Custom Cars & Cycles followed thereafter in October of that year. In August 2009, Ross signed MMG's third artist, dancehall singer Magazeen.\nIn 2010, MMG released Ross' fourth album, Teflon Don. The second album by Triple C's, Color, Cut & Clarity was for scheduled for that year, but remains unreleased. In August, Ross made an offer to Pennsylvania rapper Wiz Khalifa to sign to Maybach Music Group; however, he was signed with Universal Music Group's competitor label, Atlantic Records.\nIn February 2011, Ross parted ways with Def Jam as the label's distributor (although he remained signed as a solo act) in favor of Warner Bros. Records, and signed two of MMG's soon-to-be flagship artists: Washington D.C.-based rapper Wale and Philadelphia-based rapper Meek Mill. The following month, on March 25, Ross signed R&B singer Teedra Moses to the label; she was the label's first female artist.

It was headquartered at the 30 Hudson Yards complex in New York City.\nIt was established as Time Warner in 1990, following a merger between Time Inc. and Warner Communications. The company had film, television and cable operations. Its assets included WarnerMedia Studios & Networks (which consisted of the entertainment assets of Turner Broadcasting, HBO, and Cinemax as well as Warner Bros., which itself consisted of the film, animation, television studios, the company's home entertainment division and Studio Distribution Services, its joint venture with Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, DC Comics, New Line Cinema, and, together with CBS Entertainment Group, a 50% interest in The CW); WarnerMedia News & Sports (consisted of the news and sports assets of Turner Broadcasting, including CNN, Turner Sports, and AT&T SportsNet); WarnerMedia Sales & Distribution (consisted of digital media company Otter Media); and WarnerMedia Direct (consisted of the HBO Max streaming service).\nDespite spinning off Time Inc. in 2014, the company retained the Time Warner name until 2018, when the company was renamed WarnerMedia after it was acquired by AT&T. On October 22, 2016, AT&T officially announced that they intended on acquiring Time Warner for $85.4 billion (or $108.7 billion when including assumed Time Warner debt), valuing the company at $107.50 per share. The proposed merger was confirmed on June 12, 2018, after AT&T won an antitrust lawsuit that the U.S. Justice Department filed in 2017 to attempt to block the acquisition, and was completed two days later, when the company became a subsidiary of AT&T. The company's final name was adopted a day later. Under AT&T, the company moved to launch a streaming service built around the company's content, known as HBO Max. WarnerMedia refolded Turner's entertainment-based networks under a singular umbrella unit on August 10, 2020, through a consolidation of the WarnerMedia Entertainment and Warner Bros. Entertainment assets into a new unit, WarnerMedia Studios & Networks Group. On May 17, 2021, nearly three years after the acquisition, AT&T decided to leave the entertainment business by announcing that it had proposed to sell its ownership of WarnerMedia in a merger with Discovery, Inc. to form a new publicly traded company, Warner Bros. Discovery. The deal closed on April 8, 2022.\nThe company's previous assets included Time Inc., TW Telecom, AOL, Time Warner Cable, AOL Time Warner Book Group, and Warner Music Group; these operations were either sold to others or spun off as independent companies. The company was ranked No. 98 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Warner Communications (1972–1990) ===\n\nOn February 10, 1972, the entertainment assets of the Kinney National Company were reincorporated as Warner Communications due to a financial scandal involving price fixing in its parking operations.

Records split and WEA was formed. It was first established in Canada and followed by Australia. The Australian operation began in July 1970, by Paul Turner with five staff members. The official launch was held at the Menzies Hotel in Sydney on 1 October 1970. The company was then based in Riley Street, Darlinghurst, and had three major labels: Warner Bros. Records, Elektra Records, and Atlantic Records\nA year later Warner Bros. Records worldwide (including Australia) changed its name to Kinney Music. The monopoly laws in America at the time did not allow the three labels to trade as one, so the umbrella name of Kinney Music was chosen. For the first two years, the Australian Record Company (ARC), now known as Sony Music, handled the Australian distribution.\nTurner's income for the first year was 1 million dollars. That was achieved in seven months, with the first years sales being just under $2 million. By 1 October 1972, U.S. monopoly laws had changed and WEA, using the first initial of each of the three main labels for its name, was born. From that time, WEA Australia had its own sales and distribution arm.\nWEA became a major player in the Australian recording industry, through international successes of artists such as Fleetwood Mac, Phil Collins, Eric Clapton, Led Zeppelin and The Doors.\nThe company was renamed Warner Music Australia in 1990 and split into two divisions – WEA and East-West Records. With more focus being placed on domestic signings, phenomenal success was achieved with acts such as INXS, Cold Chisel, 1927 and Jenny Morris.\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, Warner Music also invested in Brisbane bands, Regurgitator and Pretty Violet Stain. Regurgitator became Warner Music's first direct signing and remained with the company until 2004. In 2005, Sire Records invested in Brisbane band The Veronicas, who went straight to number two with their debut single \"4 Ever\" and their album \"The Secret Life of the Veronicas\".  Later that year, Warner Music Australia bought out Festival-Mushroom Records for $12 million and closed the label, while retaining the use of the Mushroom label for a couple of acts such as Eskimo Joe and Gabriella Cilmi.\nAs of 2010, the company has continued with artists such as Kerser, Lisa Mitchell, Kylie Minogue, the New Zealand band, Evermore, as well as the newly signed Brisbane act, Dead Letter Circus. Warner Music also invested heavily in producers such as ShockOne and Matt Lange.\n\n\n== Artists ==\n\n\n== Former artists ==\n\n\n== Warner Vision Australia ==\nWarner Vision Australia, a company of Warner Music Australasia, released a series of VHS and DVD on the History of the Olympic Games:\n\nThe Official Films of the Olympic Games: London 1948 (Volume 1)\nThe Official Films of the Olympic Games: Melbourne 1956 (Volume 2)\nThe Official Films of the Olympic Games: Rome 1960 (Volume 3)\nThe Official Films of the Olympic Games: Tokyo 1964 (Volume 4)\nThe Official Films of the Olympic Games: Mexico City 1968 (Volume 5)\nThe Official Films of the Olympic Games: Montreal 1976 (Volume 6)\nThe Official Films of the Olympic Games: Moscow 1980 (Volume 7)\nThe Official Films of the Olympic Games: Los Angeles 1984 (Volume 8)\nThe Official Films of the Olympic Games: Seoul 1988 (Volume 9)\nThe Official Films of the Olympic Games: Barcelona 1992 (Volume 10)\nThe Official Films of the Olympic Games: Atlanta 1996 (Volume 11)\nWarner Music Vision Australia released a series of DVDs as a joint-venue with the Nine Network:\n\nRay Martin Presents: Graham Kennedy – The King of Television\nThe Best of the Paul Hogan Show\nChannel Nine Salutes Bert Newton\nThe Best of the Don Lane Show\nPaul Hogan's England\nStudio 9 Unplugged\nLaughs & Larrikins: Midday With Ray Martin\nGolden Logies Moments\nHey Hey It's Saturday ...

Although the movie studio and the music business share a common history, today the former is part of Comcast and the latter an independent commercial entity. During World War II, many record companies donated their metal masters to recycling for the war effort. However, Universal was an exception and donated more than 200,000 of their historic master recordings to the Library of Congress. The Decca Record Co. Ltd. of England spun American Decca off in 1939. MCA Inc. merged with American Decca in 1962.\nIn November 1990, Japanese multinational conglomerate Matsushita Electric agreed to acquire MCA for $6.59 billion. In 1995, Seagram acquired 80 percent of MCA from Matsushita. On December 9, 1996, the company was renamed Universal Studios, Inc., and its music division was renamed Universal Music Group; MCA Records continued as a label within the Universal Music Group. In May 1998, Seagram purchased PolyGram and merged it with Universal Music Group in early 1999. Seagram's entertainment assets were then sold to French media conglomerate Vivendi in 2000, along with UMG.\n\n\n=== 2004: Consolidating into a Vivendi subsidiary ===\nIn May 2004, Universal Music Group was cast under separate management from Universal Studios, when Vivendi sold 80% of the latter to General Electric, who subsequently merged it with NBC to form NBCUniversal. This came two months after the separation of Warner Music Group from Time Warner. In February 2006, Vivendi purchased the remaining 20 percent of UMG from Matsushita Electric. On September 6, 2006, Vivendi announced its €1.63 billion ($2.4 billion) purchase of BMG Music Publishing; after receiving European Union regulatory approval, the acquisition was completed on June 25, 2007.\n\n\n=== 2007–2012: UMG acquisitions and EMI purchase ===\nIn June 2007, UMG acquired Sanctuary, which eventually became UMG's entertainment merchandising and brand management division, Bravado. In 2008, Universal Music Group agreed to make its catalog available to Spotify, then a new streaming service, for use outside the U.S. on a limited basis.\nDoug Morris stepped down from his position as CEO on January 1, 2011. Former chairman/CEO of Universal Music International Lucian Grainge was promoted to CEO of the company. Grainge later replaced Morris as chairman on March 9, 2011. Morris became the next chairman of Sony Music Entertainment on July 1, 2011. With Grainge's appointment as CEO at UMG, Max Hole was promoted to COO of UMGI, effective July 1, 2010. In January 2011, UMG announced it was donating 200,000 master recordings from the 1920s to 1940s to the Library of Congress for preservation.

It oversees several labels assigned to its Atlantic Records unit. In total, the label group has nearly three hundred artists on its roster.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2004, Time Warner sold Warner Music to a group of private investors. As a cost-cutting maneuver, the new owners of Warner Music Group merged Atlantic Records with its sister, Elektra Records, to form The Atlantic Records Group. Upon the merger, Elektra became largely dormant, with most of its retained roster absorbed by Atlantic.  In the years to follow, Atlantic Records Group would add a host of other labels to its umbrella, including: Roadrunner Records, Fueled by Ramen, Custard Records and Maybach Music Group. Elektra was reactivated as a brand of Atlantic Records Group in 2009. The same year Atlantic's dance and hip hop imprint Big Beat Records, which scored notable success for most of the 1990s (but had been in hibernation since 1998) was also relaunched.\nOn June 18, 2018,  Warner Music Group announced the formation of Elektra Music Group to be launched as a stand-alone, independently managed primary label at WMG on October 1.  Splitting off from Atlantic Records Group, EMG will take with it five labels that previously operated under the Atlantic group (including Elektra Records), three label staff, and a handful of major artists. Elektra's independence renews the WEA (Warner-Elektra-Atlantic) triad that had for decades mark the original company organization. Elektra co-presidents, however, will answer to Atlantic Records Group Chairman/CEO Craig Kallman and Chairman/COO Julie Greenwald.\nIn 2020, Atlantic Records announced the relaunching of its original subsidiary label Atco Records, under the authority of its A&R President Pete Ganbarg.

Records, Maverick Records, Sire Records, Atlantic Records, Elektra Records and other Warner Music Group labels and to release them on video.\nIn 2006, Warner Music Vision merged with the Rights Company to form Warner Music Entertainment.\n\n\n== Labels ==\n\n\n=== WarnerVision Entertainment ===\nThe label also had a sublabel, WarnerVision Entertainment (formerly A*Vision Entertainment from 1990 until 1995), to release special interest products.\nThe A*Vision Entertainment label was set up in 1990 by Atlantic Records, and the first release was the documentary Banned in the U.S.A., a 2 Live Crew documentary video. It was expanded in 1991 when it partnered with Penthouse to distribute videocassettes under the Penthouse Video label. In 1992, A*Vision gradually expanded by signing a deal with VIEW Video, which A*Vision could co-distribute with the VIEW Video label.\nTwo other labels: KidVision, primarily focusing on children's videos, and NightVision, to release videos strictly at an adult audience, were set up by A*Vision as well, in January 1993. Also in 1993, Rhino Home Video, a division of Rhino Records, was signing a deal with A*Vision Entertainment, after its deal with Uni concludes. Also that year, BodyVision was launched as an label of A*Vision Entertainment, designed to release health and fitness videos, and the first videos picked up by A*Vision were Kathy Smith workout videos, which were developed after Media Home Entertainment closed its doors.\nA*Vision Entertainment also launched a label dedicated to motion pictures, which is called Atlantic Group Films. The first film released under the label was the direct-to-video erotic thriller Indecent Behavior, which ranked No. 36 in the Billboard charts in its first week. In 1994, Saban Entertainment signed a deal with A*Vision Entertainment to release titles under the Saban Home Entertainment and Libra Home Entertainment labels. Also that year, the company had acquired The Maier Group, who had produced the hit video series Buns of Steel.\nLater on, on January 21, 1995, it was shifted from Atlantic Records to Warner Bros. Records, which was rebranded to WarnerVision Entertainment on March 1, 1995, with the accompanying film unit was renamed from Atlantic Group Films to WarnerVision Films to reflect the change. Shortly afterwards, Dualstar Video, the video imprint of the Olsen twins' Dualstar Entertainment Group was subsequently moved from BMG Kidz to WarnerVision through a new distribution pact.\nOn December 23, 1995, Time Warner is planning on to spinoff its WarnerVision line to president Stuart Hersch, who is planning on to change its name back to A*Vision Entertainment, which WEA could continue to distribute. The spinoff was then nullified in 1996, with distribution shifting to Warner Home Video. While the Dualstar Video deal continued on under Warner Home Video, the Saban Entertainment deal didn't, with the company switching distributors to 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in October of that year.\n\n\n=== Warner Reprise Video ===\n\nThe company also has another notable sublabel, Warner Reprise Video (formerly Warner Music Video from 1984 until 1986), which was in operation, focusing on music video releases.\nThe company was initially set up in 1984 as Warner Music Video by WEA as a label to distribute the Warner Bros. Records catalog. It initially kicked off with a 20-minute compilation of Madonna's most recent hits. In 1986, Warner Music Video was then renamed to Warner Reprise Video, in order to add more music titles.\n\n\n=== Elektra Entertainment ===\nThe company also had another sublabel, that of Elektra Entertainment, which is operated by Elektra Records, that was established in 1986 to release the music video catalog of its Elektra Records label.\n\n\n=== WEA Music Video ===\nThe company operated WEA Video (lat\nSony Music Entertainment India Pvt.

Records and record executive Irving Azoff. Currently, this name is used as a Swedish label owned by Warner Music Sweden, a Swedish branch of Warner Music Group.\nIn 1990, Giant became a subsidiary label for Warner Music Group. Its first release, in early 1991, was the Gulf War all-star tribute song \"Voices That Care,\" assembled by producer David Foster. That spring, \"Hold You Tight\" by Tara Kemp was released and went on to become a Top 5 single. In the months that followed, Giant Records released the soundtrack album for the film New Jack City, selling 16 million copies worldwide. The label signed such acts as MC Hammer, Jade, Lord Finesse, and teen pop star Jeremy Jordan. Giant also signed established acts such as Steely Dan, Warren Zevon, Oingo Boingo, Chicago, Deep Purple, Morbid Angel, Brian Wilson, and Kenny Rogers. The label also operated a country music division in Nashville; the first act signed was Dennis Robbins.\nIn 1992, Irving Azoff expanded the Giant brand into film production. Giant Pictures only produced one film, The Inkwell, in 1994, before shutting down a year later.\nIn 1993, Giant became dissatisfied with Warner Music Group's practice of international affairs, so it made a deal with BMG to distribute its recordings outside the U.S. By the mid- to late 1990s, the company had replaced most of its staff and launched a subsidiary label called Revolution Records; Brian Wilson signed with the new label in 1997.\nThe company later reverted to its original name and distributed Paladin Records, which included singer-songwriter Steve Forbert. In 2001, Warner Music Group ended its joint venture with Giant, which was absorbed into Warner Bros. Records. Since then, BMG no longer repressed and distributed any previous releases of Giant. Distribution of current reissues are done by Warner Music's reissue division, Rhino, in conjunction with Warner Records, and many reissues still include Giant logo on packaging.\nIn February 2015, Warner Music Sweden announced that it would reactivate Giant's name; the first single released under the new Giant Records banner was Simon Erics' \"Waiting for the Sun.\"\nOn June 9, 2022, Azoff relaunched a rebranded and independent version of the label with no connections to Warner called Giant Music.  \n\n\n== Giant Records recording artists ==\nArtists on Giant Records were primarily distributed by Warner Bros.

Entertainment Inc. (commonly known as Warner Bros., or abbreviated as WB, or WBEI) is an American film and entertainment studio headquartered at the Warner Bros. Studios complex in Burbank, California, and a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). Founded in 1923 by four brothers, Harry, Albert, Sam, and Jack Warner, the company established itself as a leader in the American film industry before diversifying into animation, television, and video games, and is one of the \"Big Five\" major American film studios, as well as a member of the Motion Picture Association (MPA).\nThe company is known for its film studio division, the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, which includes Warner Bros. Pictures, New Line Cinema, Warner Bros. Pictures Animation, Castle Rock Entertainment, DC Studios, and the Warner Bros. Television Group. Bugs Bunny, a character created for the Looney Tunes series, is the company's official mascot.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\nThe company's name originated from the founding Warner brothers (born Wonsal, Woron, and Wonskolaser before Anglicization): Harry, Albert, Sam, and Jack Warner. Harry, Albert and Sam emigrated as young children with their Polish-Jewish mother to the United States from Krasnosielc, Poland (then part of Congress Poland within the Russian Empire), in October 1889, a year after their father emigrated to the U.S. and settled in Baltimore, Maryland. As in many other immigrant families, the elder Wonsal children gradually acquired anglicized versions of their Yiddish-sounding names: Szmuel Wonsal became Samuel Warner (nicknamed \"Sam\"), Hirsz Wonsal became Harry Warner, and Aaron Wonsal (although born with a given name common in the Americas) became Albert Warner. Jack, the youngest brother, was born in London, Ontario, during the family's two-year residency in Canada.\n\nThe three elder brothers began in the movie theater business, having acquired a movie projector with which they showed films in the mining towns of Pennsylvania and Ohio. In the beginning, Sam and Albert Warner invested $150 to present Life of an American Fireman and The Great Train Robbery. They opened their first theater, the Cascade, in New Castle, Pennsylvania, in 1903. When the original building was in danger of being demolished, the modern Warner Bros. called the current building owners and arranged to save it. The owners noted people across the country had asked them to protect it for its historical significance.\nIn 1904, the Warners founded the Pittsburgh-based Duquesne Amusement & Supply Company, to distribute films. In 1912, Harry Warner hired an auditor named Paul Ashley Chase. By the time of World War I, they had begun producing films; in the early 1920s they acquired their first studio facilities on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. Sam and Jack produced the pictures, while Harry and Albert, along with their auditor and now-controller Chase, handled finance and distribution in New York City. During World War I their first nationally syndicated film, My Four Years in Germany, based on a popular book by former ambassador James W. Gerard, was released. On April 4, 1923, with help from money loaned to Harry by his banker Motley Flint, they formally incorporated as Warner Bros. Pictures, Incorporated. (As late as the 1960s, Warner Bros. claimed 1905 as its founding date.)\n\nThe first important deal was the acquisition of the rights to Avery Hopwood's 1919 Broadway play, The Gold Diggers, from theatrical impresario David Belasco. However, Rin Tin Tin, a dog brought from France after World War I by an American soldier, established their reputation. Rin Tin Tin's third film was the feature Where the North Begins, which was so successful that Jack signed the dog to star in more films for $1,000 per week. Rin Tin Tin became the studio's top star. Jack nicknamed him \"The Mortgage Lifter\" and the success boosted Darryl F. Zanuck's career. Zanuck eventually became a top producer and between 1928 and 1933 served a\nEMI Group Limited (formerly EMI Group plc until 2007; originally an initialism for Electric and Musical Industries, also referred to as EMI Records or simply EMI) was a British transnational conglomerate founded in March 1931 in London. At the time of its acquisition by Universal Music in 2012, it was the fourth largest business group and record label conglomerate in the music industry, and was one of the \"Big Four\" record companies (now the \"Big Three\"). Its labels included EMI Records, Parlophone, Virgin Records, and Capitol Records, which are now referenced under Universal Music due to their acquisition with the exception of Parlophone, as it is now owned by Warner Music.\nEMI was listed on the London Stock Exchange, and was also once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index, but faced financial problems and US$4 billion in debt, leading to its acquisition by Citigroup in February 2011. Citigroup's ownership was temporary, as EMI announced in November 2011 that it would sell its music arm to Vivendi's Universal Music Group for $1.9 billion and its publishing business to a Sony/ATV consortium for around $2.2 billion. Other members of the Sony consortium include the estate of Michael Jackson, the Blackstone Group, and the Abu Dhabi–owned Mubadala Development Company. EMI's locations in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada were all disassembled to repay debt, but the primary head office located outside those countries is still functional.\nEMI Music Publishing is now owned by Sony Music Publishing, the music publishing division of Sony Music which bought another 70% stake in EMI Music Publishing.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nElectric and Musical Industries Ltd was formed in March 1931 by the merger of the Columbia Graphophone Company and the Gramophone Company, with its \"His Master's Voice\" record label, firms that have a history extending back to the origins of recorded sound. The new vertically integrated company produced sound recordings as well as recording and playback equipment.\nThe company's gramophone manufacturing led to 40 years of success with larger-scale electronics and electrical engineering.\nIn October 1979, EMI merged with Thorn Electrical Industries to create Thorn EMI.\nOn 16 August 1996, Thorn EMI shareholders voted in favour of demerging Thorn from EMI again: the company became EMI Group plc, and the electronics and rentals divisions were divested as Thorn plc.\nThe company broke up in 2012.\n\n\n== Electronics research and development ==\n\n\n=== Television ===\nIn 1934, an EMI research team led by Sir Isaac Shoenberg developed the electronic Marconi-EMI system for television broadcasting, which quickly replaced Baird's electro-mechanical system following its introduction in 1936. After the Second World War, EMI resumed its involvement in making broadcasting equipment, notably providing the BBC's second television transmitter at Sutton Coldfield. It also manufactured broadcast television cameras for British television production companies as well as for the BBC. The commercial television ITV companies also used them alongside cameras made by Pye and Marconi. Their best-remembered piece of broadcast television equipment was the EMI 2001 colour television camera, which became the mainstay of much of the British television industry from the end of the 1960s until the early 1990s. Exports of this piece of equipment were low, however, and EMI left this area of product manufacture.\n\n\n=== Blumlein and radar ===\nEMI engineer Alan Blumlein received a patent for the invention of stereophonic sound in 1931. He was killed in 1942 whilst conducting flight trials on an experimental H2S radar set.\nDuring and after World War II, the EMI Laboratories in Hayes, Hillingdon developed radar equipment (including the receiver section of the British Army's GL-II anti-aircraft fire-control radar), microwave devices such as the reflex klystron oscillator (having played a crucial role in the development of early production types following on from ",

Warner Bros. sold Brunswick a second time (along with Brunswick's back catalog up to 1931) in 1941, this time along with the old Brunswick pressing plants Warner owned, to Decca Records (which formed its American operations in 1934) in exchange for a financial interest in Decca.

The Australian operation began in July 1970, by Paul Turner with five staff members. The official launch was held at the Menzies Hotel in Sydney on 1 October 1970. The company was then based in Riley Street, Darlinghurst, and had three major labels: Warner Bros. Records, Elektra Records, and Atlantic Records\nA year later Warner Bros. Records worldwide (including Australia) changed its name to Kinney Music. The monopoly laws in America at the time did not allow the three labels to trade as one, so the umbrella name of Kinney Music was chosen. For the first two years, the Australian Record Company (ARC), now known as Sony Music, handled the Australian distribution."

From that time, WEA Australia had its own sales and distribution arm.\nWEA became a major player in the Australian recording industry, through international successes of artists such as Fleetwood Mac, Phil Collins, Eric Clapton, Led Zeppelin and The Doors.\nThe company was renamed Warner Music Australia in 1990 and split into two divisions – WEA and East-West Records. With more focus being placed on domestic signings, phenomenal success was achieved with acts such as INXS, Cold Chisel, 1927 and Jenny Morris."
