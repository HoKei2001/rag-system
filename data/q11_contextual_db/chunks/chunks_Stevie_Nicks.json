        "content": "Stephanie Lynn Nicks (born May 26, 1948) is an American singer-songwriter known for her work with the band Fleetwood Mac and as a solo artist.\nAfter starting her career as a duo with her then-boyfriend Lindsey Buckingham, releasing the album Buckingham Nicks to little success, Nicks joined Fleetwood Mac in 1975, helping the band to become one of the best-selling music acts of all time with over 120 million records sold worldwide. Rumours, the band's second album with Nicks, became one of the best-selling albums worldwide, being certified 20× platinum in the US. In 1981, while remaining a member of Fleetwood Mac, Nicks began her solo career, releasing the studio album Bella Donna, which topped the Billboard 200 and has reached multiplatinum status. She has released eight studio albums as a solo artist and seven with Fleetwood Mac, selling a certified total of 65 million copies in the U.S. alone.\nAfter the release of her first solo album, Rolling Stone named her the \"Reigning Queen of Rock and Roll\". Nicks was named one of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time and one of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time by Rolling Stone. Her Fleetwood Mac songs \"Landslide\", \"Rhiannon\", and \"Dreams\", with the last being the band's only number one hit in the U.S., together with her solo hit \"Edge of Seventeen\", have all been included in Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. She is the first woman to have been inducted twice into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: first as a member of Fleetwood Mac in 1998 and then as a solo artist in 2019.\nNicks has garnered eight Grammy Award nominations and two American Music Award nominations as a solo artist. She has won numerous awards with Fleetwood Mac, including a Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1978 for Rumours. The albums Fleetwood Mac, Rumours, and Bella Donna have been included in the \"Greatest of All Time Billboard 200 Albums\" chart by Billboard. Rumours was also rated the seventh-greatest album of all time in Rolling Stone's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", as well as the fourth-greatest album by female acts.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n\n=== 1948–1971: Early life and career beginnings ===\nStephanie Lynn \"Stevie\" Nicks was born at Good Samaritan Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona to Jess and Barbara Nicks. Nicks is of German, English, Welsh, and Irish ancestry.\nNicks's grandfather, Aaron Jess \"A.J.\" Nicks Sr., taught Nicks to sing duets with him by the time she was four years old. Nicks's mother was protective, keeping her at home \"more than most people\" and fostered in her daughter a love of fairy tales.\nAs a toddler, Stephanie could only pronounce her name as \"tee-dee\", which led to her nickname of \"Stevie\".\n\nI listened to lots of Top 40 R&B radio. I loved The Shirelles and Martha Reeves and the Vandellas; stuff like 'Remember (Walking in the Sand)' by The Shangri-Las… [My grandfather] bought me a truckload of records when I was in the fifth grade. There must have been 150 singles: country, rockabilly, some Everly Brothers, a song called 'Party Doll' that went, 'Come along and be my party doll/And I'll make love to you.'\nHer father's frequent relocation as a vice president of Greyhound had the family living in Phoenix, Albuquerque, El Paso, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. With the Goya guitar that she received for her 16th birthday, Nicks wrote her first song, titled \"I've Loved and I've Lost, and I'm Sad but Not Blue\". She spent her adolescence playing records constantly and lived in her \"own little musical world\".\nWhile attending Arcadia High School in Arcadia, California, she joined her first band, the Changing Times, a folk rock band focused on vocal harmonies.\nNicks met her future musical and romantic partner, Lindsey Buckingham, during her senior year at Menlo-Atherton High School in Atherton, California. When she saw Buckingham playing \"California Dreamin'\" at the Young Life club, she joined him in harmony. She recalled, \"I thought he was a\nThis is the solo discography of the American singer-songwriter Stevie Nicks.\nAlthough Nicks had released an album in 1973 as part of the duo Buckingham Nicks, and been a prominent member of Fleetwood Mac since 1975, she did not begin her solo career until 1981. Her debut album, Bella Donna, reached number one on the US Billboard 200 album chart and is also her best-selling album in the US. Six of her eight studio albums reached the US top ten.\n\n\n== Albums ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n\nNotes\n\n\n== Singles ==\n\n*  \"Edge of Seventeen\" never charted when originally released in the UK in 1982, but charted from downloads in the UK in 2021.\n\n\n=== Guest appearances ===\n\n\n== Soundtrack and compilation appearances ==\n\n\n== Videography ==\n\n\n=== Home video albums ===\n1982 - White Wing Dove - Stevie Nicks in Concert (Bella Donna Tour, 1981) LD/VHS\n1986 - I Can't Wait - The Music Video Collection (6 videos, 1981–86) LD/VHS\n1987 - Live at Red Rocks (Rock a Little Tour, 1986) LD/VHS/DVD/DD\n2007 - Crystal Visions – The Very Best of Stevie Nicks (Deluxe edition 13 music video collection, 1981–2001) CD+DVD\n2008 - Soundstage: Stevie Nicks Live (Broadcast, 2007) (Sears-exclusive Blu-ray 2008, Live in Chicago DVD 2009, DD 2014)\n2013 - Stevie Nicks: In Your Dreams (Album making-of documentary, 2012) DVD/DD\n2017 - Live 1983 US Festival (Broadcast, 1983) Streaming\n2020 - Live In Concert - The 24 Karat Gold Tour (Filmed 2017) 2xCD+DVD/Blu-ray/DD\n\n\n=== Music promo videos ===\n1981 - \"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\" (with Tom Petty)\n1981 - \"Insider\" (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers)\n1981 - \"Leather and Lace\" (live)\n1981 - \"Edge of Seventeen\"\n1982 - \"Edge of Seventeen\" (live)\n1983 - \"Stand Back\" (Scarlett version)\n1983 - \"Stand Back\" (release version)\n1983 - \"If Anyone Falls\"\n1985 - \"Talk to Me\"\n1986 - \"I Can't Wait\"\n1989 - \"Rooms on Fire\"\n1989 - \"Whole Lotta Trouble\" (live)\n1991 - \"Sometimes It's A Bitch\"\n1994 - \"Blue Denim\"\n1998 - \"If You Ever Did Believe\" (Practical Magic soundtrack)\n2001 - \"Every Day\"\n2001 - \"Sorcerer\" (with Sheryl Crow)\n2006 - “Dreams” (Deep Dish Remix)\n2011 - \"Cheaper Than Free\" (featuring Dave Stewart)\n2011 - \"Secret Love\"\n2011 - \"For What It's Worth\"\n2011 - \"Moonlight (A Vampire's Dream)\"\n2014 - \"Lady\"\n2015 - \"Blue Water”\n2020 - \"Show Them The Way\"\n2020 - \"Show Them The Way\" (Piano version)\n\n\n== References ==\nBuckingham Nicks is the only studio album by the duo of American rock guitarist Lindsey Buckingham and singer Stevie Nicks, both of whom later joined Fleetwood Mac. Produced by Keith Olsen, the album was released in September 1973 by Polydor Records.\nThe album was a commercial failure on its original release, and despite the duo's subsequent success, it has yet to be commercially remastered or re-released digitally.\n\n\n== Background ==\nPrior to recording the album Buckingham Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks performed together in the Fritz Rabyne Memorial Band. The pair met while they were both attending Menlo-Atherton High School in Atherton, California, south of San Francisco. At the time, Nicks was a senior in high school and Buckingham, one year younger than she, was a junior. According to Nicks, they first met at a casual, after-school Young Life gathering in 1966. Nicks and Buckingham found themselves harmonizing to what some accounts claim was a Beach Boys song, although Nicks herself claims they sang \"California Dreamin',\" a hit single by the Mamas and the Papas, in an interview she gave with The Source in 1981. Nevertheless, Nicks and Buckingham did not collaborate again for another two years. In 1968 Buckingham invited Nicks to sing in Fritz, a band for which he was playing bass guitar and which included some of his high school friends. Nicks talks about joining Fritz in an interview with Us Magazine from 1988:\n\nI met Lindsey when I was a senior in high school and he was a junior, and we sang a song together at some after-school function. Two years later, in 1968, he called me and asked me if I wanted to be in a rock & roll band. I had been playing guitar and singing pretty much totally folk-oriented stuff. So I joined the band, and within a couple of weeks we were opening for really big shows: Jefferson Airplane, Janis Joplin. All of a sudden I was in rock & roll.\nAlthough Nicks and Buckingham never performed their own original music while in Fritz, the band provided them with the opportunity to gain experience on stage, performing in front of crowds while opening for wildly successful rock and roll acts. Grace Slick of Jefferson Airplane, Janis Joplin of Big Brother and the Holding Company and Jimi Hendrix, whom Fritz also opened for, would all prove influential on Nicks and her developing stage persona. The band manager, David Forrester, worked hard to secure a record deal for Fritz, despite their sound differing from the harder, psychedelic music of their more popular contemporaries. The pair continued to perform with Fritz for three years until the band finally dissolved in 1971. Having developed a romantic relationship in addition to their working partnership, Nicks and Buckingham decided soon afterwards to move from San Francisco to Los Angeles to pursue their dreams of being signed.\n\n\n== Recording and production ==\nWhile still performing with Fritz, Nicks had attended San Jose State University, studying Speech Communication. Buckingham joined her at college, also managing to balance school and music. In 1972, the two continued to write songs, recording demo tapes at night in Daly City on a half-inch four-track Ampex tape machine Buckingham kept at the coffee roasting plant belonging to his father. They decided to drop out of college and move to Los Angeles to pursue a record deal. Taking the Ampex tape machine with them, they continued recording songs. Nicks worked several jobs, as a hostess at Bob's Big Boy, a waitress at Clementine's and as a cleaning lady for her record producer, Keith Olsen, so as to support herself and Buckingham financially; they had decided that it would be best for him not to work and to instead focus on honing his guitar technique. It was not long before Nicks and Buckingham met engineer and producer Keith Olsen as well as the casual entrepreneurs Ted Feigin and Lee Lasseff. These two had owned White Whale Records and more recently started a production company called Anthem R\nTimespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks is a compilation album featuring songs from the solo career of American singer and songwriter Stevie Nicks. It was released on September 3, 1991. The album features many of her hit singles, along with three new songs: \"Sometimes It's a Bitch\" first single released from the album, co-written by Jon Bon Jovi), \"Love's a Hard Game to Play\" (co-written by Bret Michaels) and \"Desert Angel\" (which Nicks wrote for the men and women serving in the Gulf War). The CD's booklet contains notes written by Nicks herself about the making of each song.\nThe album debuted and peaked at number 30 on the US Billboard 200, Nicks' lowest charting album at the time, but it remained on the chart for nearly six months and, as of February 2011, the album had sold over 1.5 million copies in the United States. The album was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1997. The album also achieved a Gold certification by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipping 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom and was Nicks' third top 20 album there. The album spent four weeks at number one in New Zealand. \nThe Fleetwood Mac song \"Silver Springs\" (written by Nicks) was originally intended to be in the compilation, but Mick Fleetwood, the band's drummer, would not allow Nicks to release the song because of his plans to release it on a forthcoming Fleetwood Mac box set. This led to a dispute, resulting in Nicks leaving Fleetwood Mac for several years.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n=== Weekly charts ===\n\n\n== Certifications and sales ==\n\n\n== References ==\nEnchanted (or The Enchanted Works of Stevie Nicks) is a three-disc box set of material by American singer-songwriter and Fleetwood Mac vocalist Stevie Nicks, which encompasses her solo career from Bella Donna (1981) to Street Angel (1994) and beyond.\nThe box set contains rare B-sides, unreleased live recordings, demos, songs from soundtracks, a track from the album Buckingham Nicks (1973), outtakes from the Bella Donna and Rock a Little sessions, and a new piano recording of the Nicks-penned Fleetwood Mac song, \"Rhiannon\". Some previously released tracks are also in noticeably longer versions, or alternative remixes.\nThe set was released on April 28, 1998, and peaked at #85 on the Billboard 200 Albums chart. Enchanted was certified Gold by the RIAA on April 7, 1999, for shipments of over 166,000 copies.

In addition to his tenure with Fleetwood Mac, Buckingham has released seven solo studio albums and three live albums. As a member of Fleetwood Mac, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. Buckingham was ranked 100th in Rolling Stone's 2011 list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". Buckingham is known for his fingerpicking guitar style.\nBuckingham joined Fleetwood Mac in 1975, replacing guitarist Bob Welch, and convinced the group to recruit his musical (and, at the time, romantic) partner Stevie Nicks as well. Buckingham and Nicks became prominent members of Fleetwood Mac during its most commercially successful period, highlighted by the multi-platinum studio album Rumours (1977), which sold over 40 million copies worldwide. Though highly successful, the group experienced almost constant creative and personal conflict, and Buckingham left the band in 1987 to focus on his solo career. Hit songs Buckingham wrote and sang with Fleetwood Mac include \"Go Your Own Way\", \"Never Going Back Again\", \"Tusk\", and \"Big Love\".\nA one-off reunion at the 1993 inauguration ball for President Bill Clinton initiated some rapprochement between the former band members, with Buckingham performing some vocals on one track of their 1995 studio album Time, and rejoining the band full-time in 1997 for the live tour and album The Dance. In 2018, Buckingham was fired from Fleetwood Mac and replaced by Mike Campbell and Neil Finn.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nLindsey Adams Buckingham was born on October 3, 1949, in Palo Alto, California, to Rutheda (née Elliott) and Morris Buckingham. He had two older brothers, Jeffrey and Gregory. Growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area community of Atherton, he attended Menlo-Atherton High School where Buckingham and his brothers were encouraged to swim competitively. Though Buckingham dropped out of athletics to pursue music, his brother Gregory went on to win a silver medal at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. Though he did not graduate, Lindsey attended San José State University, like his brother Greg and father Morris.\nBuckingham's first forays into guitar playing took place on a toy Mickey Mouse guitar, playing along to his brother Jeff's extensive collection of 45s. Noticing his talent, Buckingham's parents bought their son a $35 Harmony guitar.\nBuckingham never took guitar lessons and does not read music. By age 13, he became interested in folk music and, influenced by banjo methods, practiced the energetic style of the Kingston Trio.\n\n\n== Music career ==\nFrom 1966 to 1971, Buckingham performed psychedelic and folk rock with the high school rock band originally named the Fritz Rabyne Memorial Band as a bassist and vocalist. The band regrouped in 1967 due to band member changes and shortened their name to Fritz. Buckingham invited friend Stevie Nicks to join Fritz as a backing vocalist. Their romantic relationship began after both left Fritz five years later.\n\n\n=== 1973–1974: Buckingham Nicks ===\nBuckingham and his then-girlfriend Stevie Nicks recorded seven demos in 1972 on a half-inch 4-track Ampex recorder kept at his father's coffee-roasting plant in Daly City, then drove to Los Angeles to pursue a recording contract. In 1973, Polydor Records signed the pair. Their studio album, produced by Keith Olsen and second engineer Richard Dashut, Buckingham Nicks, was released in September 1973; however, soon after its release Polydor dropped the duo because of poor sales. To help make ends meet, Buckingham toured with Don Everly's backing band, singing Phil Everly's parts.\n\n\n=== 1975–1980: Fleetwood Mac and mainstream success ===\n\nWhile investigating Sound City recording studio in California, Mick Fleetwood heard the song \"Frozen Love\" from the Buckingham Nicks studio album. Impressed, he asked who th\nCrystal Visions... The Very Best of Stevie Nicks is a compilation album released by the American singer-songwriter and Fleetwood Mac vocalist Stevie Nicks. It features songs from her solo career, as well as her career with Fleetwood Mac. It includes her hit singles, a dance remix, and one new track, a live version of Led Zeppelin's \"Rock and Roll\". Three singles were culled from the album: \"Rock and Roll\", \"Landslide\", and a remixed version of \"Stand Back\". There are two versions of this album, one with just the audio CD and another version with an included DVD featuring all of Nicks' music videos with audio commentary from Nicks, as well as rare footage from the Bella Donna recording sessions. The album debuted and peaked at No. 21 in the United States selling 33,944 copies in its first week. The album spent a total of 12 weeks on the Billboard 200 chart, and had sold 348,000 copies as of February 2011. The album is certified gold in Australia and the United Kingdom.\nThe title refers to a lyric from \"Dreams\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\"The Magical Delights of Stevie Nicks\" is the tenth episode of the third season of the anthology television series American Horror Story, which  premiered on January 8, 2014, on the cable network FX. The episode was written by James Wong and directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon. \nIn this episode, Fiona (Jessica Lange) tries to out the next Supreme with a visit by Stevie Nicks and Madison (Emma Roberts) tries to eliminate her competition for the Supremacy. This episode marks Nicks' acting debut. She agreed to do the show based on her love of Glee, another show from the same creative team. Angela Bassett, Danny Huston and Patti LuPone guest star as Marie Laveau, the Axeman, and Joan Ramsey, respectively. This episode is rated TV-MA (LV).\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\nMisty Day is overwhelmed when presented to Stevie Nicks, who gives away her trademark shawl to Misty as a lucky charm for the Seven Wonders trial. \nMarie Laveau reveals to Fiona the source of her immortality: \"to sell the soul to Papa Legba and obey his commands no matter what once a year\", which in Marie's case is to get him an innocent life starting with her own baby centuries ago.\nMadison tries to sabotage Zoe and the other witches in the race for the Supremacy.\nCordelia breaks down, feeling useless and responsible for the impending war and begins destroying the greenhouse. Shortly after, the Delphi Trust, losing half of their finances in less than 10 minutes, suspects witchcraft influence and starts planning the extermination of the Coven. Fiona summons Papa Legba, offering her soul in exchange for eternal youth and willing to do any request for it, but the spirit turns down the deal as he claims she has \"no soul to give\". After this, she becomes determined to kill all of the Coven in order to murder the new Supreme.\nMarie and Fiona decide to get rid of Nan, considering her too dangerous after she finds the stolen newborn for Papa Legba and starts claiming she would be a better and kinder Supreme. They offer her as a sacrifice to Papa Legba, drowning her in the bathtub. He accepts the substitute for the newborn and warns Laveau and Fiona of being \"trouble\" together.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRotten Tomatoes reports a 77% approval rating, based on 13 reviews. The critical consensus reads, \"The titular rock star provides grounding for \"The Magical Delights of Stevie Nicks\", an enjoyably odd episode that becomes bolder as it progresses, even if the characters and storylines grow more difficult to track.\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A− rating, saying, \"\"The Magical Delights of Stevie Nicks\" is by far the best episode of this season of American Horror Story. Freed from the constraints of its endless circling and with an actual villain to face off with, the show's characters start actually doing stuff, and the series' momentum grows exponentially.\" However, she added: \"It's also a completely ridiculous episode of television.\" Matt Fowler from IGN gave the episode a 7.3/10 rating, saying, \"While offering up a handful of surprising moments, \"The Magical Delights of Stevie Nicks\" was still Coven's weakest entry. The sick and depraved danger fell by the wayside, replaced with soap-y Supreme competitiveness.\"\nThe episode received a 1.8 18–49 ratings share and was watched by 3.49 million viewers in its original American broadcast, a decrease from the previous episode.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\"The Magical Delights of Stevie Nicks\" at IMDb\n\"The Magical Delights of Stevie Nicks\" at TV Guide.com\n24 Karat Gold: Songs from the Vault is the eighth solo studio album by the American singer-songwriter and Fleetwood Mac vocalist Stevie Nicks, released on September 30, 2014, through Reprise Records.\n\n\n== Background ==\nRecorded in Nashville and Los Angeles, the album includes new versions of demos that Nicks primarily recorded between 1969 and 1987, though two songs date back to 1994 and 1995. There is one cover on the album, \"Carousel\", a song originally written and performed by Vanessa Carlton on her album Rabbits on the Run (2011). Nicks put it on the album because it was her mother's favorite song in her last days and Carlton was present during her death. Nicks was inspired to record the album after her assistant showed her bootlegs on YouTube of the demos Nicks had recorded over the years. Included on the album is \"Blue Water\", a song that features Lady A on vocals.\nThe album sold 33,000 copies in its first week of release and debuted at #7 on the Billboard 200, giving Nicks her sixth top ten album on that chart.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Album ===\nThe album was released as standard and deluxe editions. The standard edition contains 14 tracks and features several previously unpublished polaroid photos of Nicks throughout her career. The limited quantity deluxe edition features a different track list order with two bonus tracks (\"Twisted\" and \"Watch Chain\") in addition to a full color 48-page photo book of never-before-released photos.\nThe set was also released on vinyl with the deluxe edition track listing on two 125-gram LPs housed in a gatefold package.\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nThe album was supported by three singles. Additionally, several promotional singles were made available for download from the album prior to its release. \"The Dealer\", was released on August 5, 2014, followed by \"Lady\" on August 25, \"Starshine\", on September 16, and the title track on September 23, 2014.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\n24 Karat Gold: Songs from the Vault received mostly positive reviews from music critics upon its release. At Metacritic, the album has received a Metascore of 73 out of 100 based on 11 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic rated the album four and a half stars out of five and calls it \"the best-sounding record she's made since 1983's The Wild Heart.\" Writing for New York Daily News, Jim Farber gave the album three stars out of five and states: \"We get pure Stevie — needier than some might find comfortable, but also unexpectedly wise. It's too much for the casual listener but catnip for the devoted.\"\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nThe album debuted on the Billboard 200 at #7 with sales of 33,000  giving Nicks her sixth top 10 album. The album also debuted on the UK Albums chart at #14 with sales of 5,508, giving Nicks her fifth UK Top 20 album.\nNicks made various TV appearances to promote the album, including the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon where she performed \"Lady\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMain Performers\n\nStevie Nicks – vocals, keyboards\nVanessa Carlton – backing vocals on \"Carousel\"\nSharon Celani – backing vocals\nLady A (Hillary Scott, Charles Kelley, Dave Haywood) – backing vocals on \"Blue Water\"\nJessica Nicks – backing vocals on \"Carousel\"\nLori Nicks – backing vocals\nDavid A.

It is her first solo studio album since Trouble in Shangri-La (2001) and also coincides with the 30th anniversary of the release of her debut solo album Bella Donna.\nOn May 11, 2011, Billboard announced that the album had sold 52,418 copies in its first week of release and debuted at No. 6 on the Billboard 200, giving Nicks her fifth top ten album on that chart. The album spent 16 weeks within the Billboard 200 and has sold 199,000 copies in the United States as of May 2014 according to Nielsen SoundScan. In Your Dreams debuted and peaked at No. 14 on the UK Albums Chart, giving Nicks her fifth Top 20 album there. The accompanying 2011/12 tour though only fairly short, grossed $8.7 million in North America alone.\n\n\n== Background and composition ==\nIn late February 2010, David A. Stewart (musician and record producer, best known for his work with Eurythmics) revealed, using his Twitter account, that he was working with Nicks on at least four new songs, including one called \"Everybody Loves You\". A 38-second snippet of the song was posted on Stewart's Twitter account. He confirmed that he and Nicks were working on an album, and said that it is being done \"in a very new way\".\nOn March 16, 2010, Stewart reported on his Twitter that he and Nicks were now recording songs together. On BBC Radio 2 on May 3, 2010, he stated in an interview with DJ Simon Mayo that the new album will be recorded throughout June with a release later that year, however this proved premature.\nOn July 5, 2010, Stewart tweeted several pictures and messages about him and Nicks working in the studio. In one of the tweets, Stewart stated that he, Nicks, Waddy Wachtel, Mike Campbell, Michael Bradford, Mike Rowe and Steve Ferrone were all working on the album, and that Mick Fleetwood has also contributed drums to at least one track. Waddy Wachtel has been Nicks' lead guitarist for most of her solo career, featuring prominently on all of her albums to date. Stewart also stated in that tweet that seven tracks have been completed thus far and it was their final day of these sessions in the studio together. Nicks was scheduled to play five live dates in the United States in August, and then returned to the studio to complete writing and recording on the album.\nThe cover of the album was released on March 7, 2011, via Nicks' official website. The cover photograph was taken by Kristin Burns and features Nicks and a horse in a forest scene. The track listing was made available soon after.\n\n\n== Singles ==\nThe first single, \"Secret Love\", was released on January 13, 2011. The single was made available for immediate digital download by pre-ordering the album from stevienicks.warnerreprise.com.

Stewart, was also released.\n\"Soldier's Angel\" was released to some radio outlets on May 27, 2011. Although the song has not been confirmed to be a single, it has received promotional airplay from several radio stations and by purchasing the song through the Lifetime Network as a download supports \"The Yellow Ribbon Fund\" for the U.S. Military.\nOn June 16, 2011, it was announced that \"For What It's Worth\" would be released as the second single for In Your Dreams, according to a press release issued by Live Nation, which also announced Nicks' concert tour. The single was released to radio on July 11, 2011.

Written by Chas Sandford, the song was released as the lead single from the album in October 1985, through Modern Records. The single became a big hit for Nicks, peaking at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for two weeks and peaking at number one on the Billboard Top Mainstream Rock Songs chart for two weeks in 1985.\n\n\n== Background and composition ==\nThe song was written by Chas Sandford, who co-wrote John Waite's 1984 hit \"Missing You\". Sandford also plays most of the instruments on \"Talk to Me\". The song was brought to Nicks' attention by producer Jimmy Iovine, \"who was always on the hunt for a hit song.\" Nicks said she didn't like the song at first because she had trouble with the vocals, but Iovine persisted and she eventually recorded it. Jim Keltner was in the studio next door doing some drum overdubs during the recording process. After Nicks explained her dilemma, Keltner gave her some words of encouragement and offered to stay with her and be her audience. Nicks sang the song twice during the session and then it was finished.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nCash Box called it \"a mid-tempo rocker which makes good uses of Nicks’ throaty lead and harmony vocals.\"  Billboard said that it \"packs a real wallop.\"\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe promotional music video shows Nicks performing the song direct to camera in a variety of different sets in what looks like a grand house. One of the sets is a long white room that looks like an art gallery and has three steps in the middle which Nicks, her backing singers Sharon Celani and Lori Perry, and two male dancers, perform choreographed dance steps together. Nicks' brother, Christopher, features in the video playing the saxophone.\n\n\n== Live performances ==\n\"Talk to Me\" made its live debut on the Rock a Little world tour in 1986. It was also included on the Canadian leg of The Other Side of the Mirror tour set in 1989. Nicks also performed on the 1991 \"Whole Lotta Trouble Tour\" to promote her greatest hits album Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks.\nThe last time it was played live was on the Street Angel Tour in 1994.\n\n\n== Single release formats ==\n\"Talk to Me\" was released as a 7-inch vinyl in many territories in the picture sleeve featured above, with \"One More Big Time Rock and Roll Star\" as its non-album B-side. Promo 7-inch singles with picture sleeve were also released in some countries, including the U.S., and featured the title track on both sides of the disc.\nPicture sleeves varied country by country in its European 7\" release, with Spain and Germany using sleeves which featured the artist name and title but no photograph, and the UK used a picture sleeve which featured the black-and-white photograph of Nicks which was used for the back cover of the Rock a Little LP sleeve. The single peaked at number 68 in the UK.\nA 3-track 12\" single was issued in the UK and Germany (but with differing picture sleeves), featuring the album version of the title track and \"One More Big Time Rock and Roll Star\" and \"Imperial Hotel\" as the B-sides.\nA 12-inch promo was released in the U.S. featuring a full-color glossy picture sleeve and additional inner sleeve, and the disc featured the title track in mono and stereo.\n\n\n== Other versions ==\nNicks re-recorded the song in 1986 for inclusion on the Time-Life compilation It's Only Rock and Roll.\nThe rock band Lovedrug included a live recording of \"Talk to Me\" on the fan-chosen covers album from the I AM LOVEDRUG campaign.

A 6-LP vinyl release was produced as well, released on June 28, 2019. The album was released through Rhino Entertainment, and was intended to coincide with Nicks's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n=== Stand Back ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\"Stand Back\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Stevie Nicks from her second solo studio album The Wild Heart (1983). The song was released as the lead single from the album in May 1983 and reached number five on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the Top Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in August of that year. \"Stand Back\" has been a staple in Nicks' live shows since its pre-album debut at the 1983 US Festival, and it has also been included in the Fleetwood Mac tour set lists since 1987.\nIn the United Kingdom, the single was Nicks' first 12-inch release, featuring a different glossy picture sleeve and the inclusion of a third track, \"Wild Heart\". A 12-inch promotional single was also released to United States radio stations in 1983, featuring a full-colour sleeve, but playing the standard album version (in mono and stereo) on both sides.\n\n\n== Background and composition ==\nNicks has often told the story of how she wrote \"Stand Back\". She wrote it on the day of her marriage to Kim Anderson on January 29, 1983. The newlyweds were driving up to San Ysidro Ranch in Santa Barbara when Prince's song \"Little Red Corvette\" came on the radio. Nicks started humming along to the melody, especially inspired by the lush synthesizers on the song. The couple retrieved a tape recorder and Nicks recorded the demo in the honeymoon suite that night. Later, when Nicks went into the studio to record the song, she called Prince and told him the story of how she wrote the song to his melody. On the night of February 8, 1983, Prince came to the studio and played synthesizers on it, although his contribution is uncredited on the album. He and Nicks did agree however to split the publishing royalties on the song 50-50. Then, she says, \"he just got up and left as if the whole thing happened in a dream.\"\nSynth player Dave Bluefield, who also programmed the song's rhythm on a DMX drum machine, said that he played the main chords on the song using an Oberheim OB-Xa synthesizer and Prince did the \"8th note up beats\" in the upper octaves during the choruses (first heard at the 0:54 mark - supposedly played with just two fingers). It's possible that Prince played other synth parts that didn't make the final mix.\nPrince, however, remarked a different story in regards to the song's drum programming and creation: \"When I got there, her and Jimmy Iovine couldn't figure out how to work the drum machine...because people were using live drums at that point...so I went down there and programmed it for them and pretty much played most of the song there in about twenty or thirty minutes\".\nThere were two mixes made of the song: the generally more well-known album version (4:48) and the edited single version (4:18). Differences between the two are somewhat subtle, but the single version tends to have more of a \"collapsed\" or \"mono\" sound to it and the electronic drum programs are mixed rather dry and flattened, especially in the song's intro bars; whereas the drum tracks on the album version are accentuated by a generous amount of reverb effect and harder compression. Acoustic drums were given a more backseat role on \"Stand Back\". There is a further \"polished\" version of the track, with crisper percussion and louder foreground synth, featured on Nicks' 1991 compilation album Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks, remixed by Chris Lord-Alge with a run time of 4:59.\n“Stand Back” is performed in the key of B minor with a tempo of 116 beats per minute in common time. The song follows a chord progression of A/G – G – D/A – A – D/A – G/B – Bm – A/B – D/A – G/A – A, and Nicks’ vocals span from A3 to B4.\n\n\n== B-side ==\n\"Garbo\", the B-side to \"Stand Back\", is a song referencing Greta Garbo. Another song, partially inspired by Garbo, called \"Greta\", appears on the 1994 album Street Angel.\nThe lyrics from the third verse of \"Vogue\", by Madonna, coincidentally mention the same first three people — Garbo, Marlene Dietrich and Marilyn Monroe (with the second and third names flippe\n\"Leather and Lace\" is a song performed by American singers Stevie Nicks and Don Henley. It was released on October 6, 1981, as the second single from Nicks' solo debut studio album Bella Donna (1981).\nNicks and Henley were romantically involved from 1977 until 1978. Nicks originally wrote the song for Waylon Jennings and Jessi Colter's duet album Leather and Lace, but the song was not included. Jennings still intended to use the song for his solo work, while Nicks became attached to the idea of the song as a duet. Nicks' version, a duet with Eagles singer Don Henley, peaked at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks in January 1982.  Jimmy Iovine was the producer.  \nThe song compares the male singer's rougher life, represented by leather, to the female singer's softer life, represented by lace, and how opposites can attract. Record World called it a \"magical ballad.\"\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Jeffery Austin and Gwen Stefani remake ==\n\nJeffery Austin and Gwen Stefani performed a cover of the song on December 14, 2015, for the season nine finale of The Voice.

Green recruited drummer Mick Fleetwood, guitarist and singer Jeremy Spencer and bassist Bob Brunning, with John McVie replacing Brunning a few weeks after the band's first public appearance at the 1967 National Jazz & Blues Festival in Windsor. The band became a five-piece in 1968 with the addition of guitarist and singer Danny Kirwan.\nPrimarily a British blues band in their early years, Fleetwood Mac achieved a UK number-one single in 1968 with the instrumental \"Albatross\", and had other UK top ten hits with \"Man of the World\", \"Oh Well\" (both 1969), and \"The Green Manalishi (With the Two Prong Crown)\" (1970). Green left the band in May 1970, with McVie's wife Christine McVie (who had previously contributed to the band as a session musician) joining as an official member on vocals and keyboards two months later. Spencer and Kirwan also left in 1971 and 1972 respectively, with Bob Welch replacing Spencer, and Bob Weston and Dave Walker replacing Kirwan. By the end of 1974, Weston and Walker had been dismissed and Welch had left, leaving the band without a guitarist or male vocalist. While Fleetwood was scouting studios in Los Angeles, he heard the American folk-rock duo Buckingham Nicks, consisting of guitarist and singer Lindsey Buckingham and singer Stevie Nicks. In December 1974, he asked Buckingham to join Fleetwood Mac. Buckingham agreed on the condition that Nicks could also join. The addition of Buckingham and Nicks gave the band a more pop rock sound, and their 1975 album Fleetwood Mac topped the Billboard 200 chart in the United States. Their next album, Rumours (1977), produced four U.S. Top 10 singles and remained at number one on the Billboard 200 for 31 weeks. It also reached the top spot in countries around the world and won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1978. Rumours has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums in history. Although each member of the band went through a breakup (John and Christine McVie, Buckingham and Nicks, and Fleetwood and his wife Jenny Boyd) while recording the album, they continued to write and record together.\nThe line-up remained stable through three more studio albums, but by the late 1980s began to disintegrate. After Buckingham left in 1987, he was replaced by Billy Burnette and Rick Vito, although Vito left in 1990 along with Nicks. A 1993 one-off performance for the first inauguration of President Bill Clinton reunited the classic 1974–1987 line-up for the first time in six years. A full-scale reunion took place four years later, and Fleetwood Mac released their fourth U.S. No. 1 album, The Dance (1997), a live album marking the 20th anniversary of Rumours and the band's 30th anniversary. Christine McVie left in 1998 after the completion of The Dance tour. Fleetwood Mac released their final studio album, Say You Will, in 2003. Christine McVie rejoined in 2014 for their On With the Show Tour. In 2018, Buckingham was fired and replaced by Mike Campbell, formerly of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and Neil Finn of Split Enz and Crowded House. After Christine McVie's death in 2022, Nicks said in 2024 that the band would not continue without her.\nFleetwood Mac have sold more than 120 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling bands. In 1979, they were honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1998, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In 2018, Fleetwood Mac received the MusiCares Person of the Year award from the Recording Academy in recognition of their artistic achievement in the music industry and dedication to philanthropy.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1967–1970: Formation and early years ===\n\nFleetwood Mac were formed in July 1967 in London, England, by Peter Green after he left the British blues band \n\"I Can't Wait\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Stevie Nicks from her third solo studio album Rock a Little (1985). Written by Nicks, Rick Nowels, and Eric Pressly, the song was released as the album's lead single in Australia, the United Kingdom and Ireland, and as the second single in the United States and Germany.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\"I Can't Wait\" was recorded in 1985 at The Village studio in West Los Angeles and was written by Nicks, Rick Nowels, and Eric Pressly. The song was produced by Nowles and Jimmy Iovine, who had worked with Nicks since her 1981 Bella Donna album but later left the Rock a Little project.\nNicks explained the song in depth in the liner notes of her 1991 compilation album Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks: \n\n\"To understand this song, you sort of have to let yourself go a little crazy. Love is blind, it never works out, but you just have to have it. I think this was about the most exciting song that I had ever heard. My friend, Rick, whom I had known since I was 18 and he was 13, brought over this track with this incredible percussion thing, and gave it to me asking me if I would listen to it and consider writing a song for it. I listened to the song once, and pretended not to be that knocked out, but the second Rick left, I ran in my little recording studio and wrote 'I Can't Wait.' It took all night, and I think it is all about how electric I felt about this music. And that night, that SATURDAY night, Rick and I went into a BIG studio and recorded it. I sang it only once, and have never sung it since in the studio. Some vocals are magic and simply not able to beat. So I let go of it, as new to me as it was; but you know, now when I hear it on the radio, this incredible feeling comes over me, like something really incredible is about to happen.\"\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\n\"I Can't Wait\" first charted in Australia, debuting on the Kent Music Report chart on 13 January 1986,  peaking at No. 20 in February. The single first entered the UK Singles Chart on 25 January 1986, peaking at No. 54 in early February; Nicks' first single to chart in the UK since \"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\" in 1981. \"I Can't Wait\" spent a week on the Irish Singles Chart peaking at No. 29 on 23 January 1986. In New Zealand, the single entered the chart on 16 February 1986, peaking at No. 39 the following week. In the United States, the single peaked inside the top 20, peaking at No. 16 for two weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 and is one of only four of Nicks' singles to enter the Dance Club Songs chart, peaking inside the top 30. In Germany, \"I Can't Wait\" entered the chart in early May 1986, peaking at No. 58 two weeks later.\nThe single's American chart run coincided with that of a Nu Shooz song also titled \"I Can't Wait\".\nThe song was re-issued as a single in the UK and Europe in October 1991, to promote the Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks compilation album. The single peaked marginally higher in the UK on this release, at No. 47 in November 1991.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video for \"I Can't Wait\" was directed by Marty Callner. The music video features Nicks, her brother Christopher, Sharon Celani, and Lori Perry-Nicks (Nicks’ longtime back-up singers), choreographer Brad Jeffries and a cheeky Mick Fleetwood on a stage and on a set of stairs.\nNicks also performs parts by herself in a small room which could be a interpreted as a prison cell. Nicks is primarily dressed in black and sings the song in front of a microphone and sometimes a tambourine, which goes back to Nicks' trademark image of her performances of \"Rhiannon\" with Fleetwood Mac.\n\nNicks says that she did drugs on the set of all her videos of the era, however, regarding the video for \"I Can't Wait\" she said in I Want My MTV: \n\"I look at that video, I look at my eyes, and I say to myself, 'Could you have laid off the pot, the coke and the tequila for three days, so you could have looked a little better? It just makes me want to go back into that vide\nThe Wild Heart is the second solo studio album by American singer and songwriter Stevie Nicks. Recording began in late 1982, shortly after the end of Fleetwood Mac's Mirage Tour. After the death of her best friend, Robin Anderson, and with new appreciation for her life and career, Nicks recorded the album in only a few months and was released on June 10, 1983, a year after Fleetwood Mac's Mirage album. It peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200 (for seven consecutive weeks) and achieved platinum status on September 12, 1983. The album has shipped 2 million copies in the US alone.\nThe album is notable for its array of prominent guest musicians. Tom Petty made a return to write \"I Will Run to You\", on which his bandmates from The Heartbreakers performed. Nicks' Fleetwood Mac bandmate, Mick Fleetwood, made an appearance on the track \"Sable on Blonde\". Toto's Steve Lukather contributed some of the guitar work on what would become the album's biggest hit single, \"Stand Back\", which also features an uncredited contribution from Prince, who played the synthesizer track. Nicks also worked with friend Sandy Stewart, who wrote the music for three tracks on the album and performed on several (Stewart would go on to write the 1987 Fleetwood Mac hit \"Seven Wonders\"). The album's final track, \"Beauty and the Beast\", features a full string section performing a score arranged and conducted by Paul Buckmaster. Nicks had recorded various other tracks prior to the album's release, including \"Violet and Blue\" which was featured on the movie soundtrack for Against All Odds, and later on Nicks' 3-disc retrospective box set Enchanted in 1998.\nThe Wild Heart was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1993, ten years after its release, denoting shipments in excess of two million copies in the United States. It spent a whole year on the Billboard 200 from June 1983 to June 1984. It has also been certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments in excess of 60,000 in the United Kingdom. Three singles were released from the album: \"Stand Back\", which charted at number five; \"If Anyone Falls\", which charted at number 14; and \"Nightbird\", which charted at number 33. \"Stand Back\" and \"If Anyone Falls\" featured accompanying music videos that went into heavy rotation on MTV. \"Nightbird\", a track that Nicks has said was her favorite on the album, was performed live on Solid Gold and Saturday Night Live.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\nThe Wild Heart: Deluxe Edition (Rhino, 2016)\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nStevie Nicks – lead and backing vocals\nSandy Stewart – synthesizers (1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9), keyboards (3), acoustic piano solo (5), lead vocals (5), additional backing vocals (5)\nRoy Bittan – synthesizers (2), acoustic piano (4, 8, 9, 10)\nBenmont Tench – organ (3, 4, 5), keyboards (7)\nDavid Foster – acoustic piano (5)\nDavid Bluefield – Oberheim OB-Xa programming (6), Oberheim DMX drum machine (6)\nPrince – synthesizers (6, uncredited)\nDavid Monday – guitars (1, 3)\nDean Parks – guitars (1)\nWaddy Wachtel – guitars (2-6, 9)\nSteve Lukather – guitars (6)\nDavid Williams – guitars (6)\nMike Campbell – guitars (7)\nTom Petty – guitars (7), lead and backing vocals (7)\nDon Felder – guitars (8)\nRoger Tausz – bass (1)\nBob Glaub – bass (2, 4, 8)\nRuss Powell - bass (3, 6)\nKenny Edwards – bass (5, 9)\nHowie Epstein – bass (7)\nJohn Beal – bass (10)\nBrad Smith – drums (1, 3), percussion (3)\nRuss Kunkel – drums (2, 4, 8), drum overdubs (6)\nMarvin Caruso – drums (5, 6)\nChet McCracken – drum overdubs (5)\nStan Lynch – drums (7)\nMick Fleetwood – drums (9)\nBobbye Hall – percussion (2, 4, 6, 8)\nIan Wallace – percussion (6)\nPhil Kenzie – saxophone (8)\nSharon Celani – backing vocals\nLori Perry-Nicks – backing vocals\nCarolyn Brooks – backing vocals (2, 10)\nString section on \"Beauty and the Beast\"\n\nPaul Buckmaster – string arrangements and conductor\nKenneth Whitfield – string arrangements\nJon Abramowitz, Seymour Barab, Jesse Levy and Fr\nFleetwood Mac are a British-American rock band originally formed in London. Formed in July 1967, the group originally consisted of lead guitarist and singer Peter Green, slide guitarist and singer Jeremy Spencer, bassist Bob Brunning and drummer Mick Fleetwood. After several personnel changes, the band's classic lineup, in place from December 1974 to September 1987, consisted of Fleetwood, bassist John McVie, keyboardist and singer Christine McVie, singer Stevie Nicks, and guitarist and singer Lindsey Buckingham. The band then underwent several more changes in personnel, with the final lineup, beginning in November 2018, consisting of Fleetwood, John and Christine McVie, Nicks, lead guitarist Mike Campbell and rhythm guitarist and singer Neil Finn. Christine McVie died in 2022, after which Nicks stated that the band would not continue without her.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1967–1973 ===\nAfter leaving John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, guitarist and vocalist Peter Green and drummer Mick Fleetwood formed Fleetwood Mac in July 1967 with slide guitarist Jeremy Spencer and bassist Bob Brunning. In September, Brunning was replaced by John McVie, Green and Fleetwood's original choice for the role. Danny Kirwan was added as a third guitarist following the release of Mr. Wonderful in August 1968. Green suddenly left the band in 1970 due to problems with drug abuse and mental health issues, playing his last show with the band on 20 May. McVie's wife Christine – who had collaborated with the band multiple times – joined on keyboards and vocals shortly after Green's departure, officially becoming a member in August.\nDuring a United States tour in February 1971, Spencer departed Fleetwood Mac after leaving the band's Los Angeles hotel and not returning; it was later revealed that he had joined the Children of God organisation. Green temporarily returned to take Spencer's place on the tour, with Bob Welch joining after its conclusion. Kirwan was fired by Fleetwood in August 1972, after he got into a drunken argument with Welch backstage, injured himself, broke his guitar and refused to perform. He was replaced by Bob Weston the following month, when vocalist Dave Walker also joined the band. Walker had left by June the following year, shortly after the release of Penguin. Weston stayed to perform on its follow-up Mystery to Me later in the year, but was fired in October after having an affair with Fleetwood's wife Jenny Boyd Fleetwood.\n\n\n=== 1974 onwards ===\nAfter spending much of the year involved in a legal dispute with former manager Clifford Davis, the four-piece Fleetwood Mac returned in late 1974 with Heroes Are Hard to Find. By the end of the year, Welch had left the band, with his replacement Lindsey Buckingham joining on New Year's Eve 1974 with his girlfriend, vocalist Stevie Nicks. This lineup of the band remained constant for over twelve years and multiple successful releases, before Buckingham left in August 1987. He was replaced by two guitarists: Billy Burnette and Rick Vito. Nicks and Christine McVie both retired from the touring lineup of the band after the last show of the Behind the Mask Tour on 7 December 1990, although McVie contributed to recordings for the band's next studio album Time in 1995. Vito also left the band in October 1991.\nThe 1974–1987 lineup of Fleetwood Mac reunited for a performance at Bill Clinton's inauguration on 20 January 1993. Nicks and Burnette left the band shortly thereafter, with Bekka Bramlett and Dave Mason, respectively, replacing the departed members later in the year. Both performed on 1995's Time, which also featured a returning Burnette on guitar. Shortly after the album was released in October, Fleetwood Mac disbanded. Within a year, however, the band had returned with a lineup including Nicks, Buckingham, the McVies and Fleetwood. They returned to touring in 1997, releasing the live album The Dance in August, before Christine McVie left again in 1998 and all but retired from music. She ult\nChristine Anne McVie ( née Perfect; 12 July 1943 – 30 November 2022) was an English musician and singer-songwriter. She was the keyboardist and one of the vocalists and songwriters of Fleetwood Mac. \nMcVie was a member of several bands, notably Chicken Shack, in the mid-1960s British blues scene. She initially began working with Fleetwood Mac as a session player in 1968, before officially joining the band two years later. Her first compositions with Fleetwood Mac appeared on their fifth album, Future Games. She remained with the band through many changes of line-up, writing songs and performing lead vocals before partially retiring in 1998. McVie was described as \"the prime mover behind some of Fleetwood Mac's biggest hits\" and eight songs she wrote or co-wrote, including \"Don't Stop\", \"Everywhere\" and \"Little Lies\", appeared on Fleetwood Mac's 1988 Greatest Hits album. She appeared as a session musician on the band's last studio album, Say You Will. McVie also released three solo studio albums and recorded a duet album with Lindsey Buckingham. McVie was noted for her light mezzo-soprano voice.\nAs a member of Fleetwood Mac, McVie was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and in 1998 received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In the same year, after almost 30 years with Fleetwood Mac, she left the band and lived in semi-retirement, releasing a solo album in 2004. She appeared on stage with Fleetwood Mac at the O2 Arena in London in September 2013 and rejoined the band in 2014 prior to their On with the Show tour.\nMcVie received a Gold Badge of Merit Award from BASCA, now The Ivors Academy, in 2006. She received the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors in 2014 and was honoured with the Trailblazer Award at the UK Americana Awards in 2021. She was also the recipient of two Grammy Awards.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nChristine Anne Perfect was born on 12 July 1943 in the village of Greenodd, in the Furness area of Lancashire. She grew up in the Bearwood area of Smethwick near Birmingham. Her father, Cyril Percy Absell Perfect, was a concert violinist and music lecturer at St Peter's College of Education, Saltley, Birmingham, and taught violin at St Philip's Grammar School, Birmingham. Perfect's mother, Beatrice Edith Maud (née Reece), was a medium, psychic, and faith healer. Perfect's grandfather was an organist at Westminster Abbey.\nPerfect was introduced to the piano when she was four, but did not study music seriously until the age of 11, when she was reintroduced to it by a local musician who was a friend of her brother John. She continued classical training to the age of 15, but shifted her musical focus to rock and roll when her brother acquired a Fats Domino songbook. Other early influences included the Everly Brothers.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early music ===\nPerfect studied sculpture at Moseley School of Art in Birmingham for five years with the aim of becoming an art teacher, and while at art school, she met  budding musicians in Britain's blues scene. Her introduction to performing music came when she met guitarist Stan Webb and bass player Andy Silvester, who were in a band called Sounds of Blue. Knowing that Perfect had musical talent, they invited her to join them. She also sang with Spencer Davis. By the time Perfect graduated from art college, Sounds of Blue had split up. She did not have enough money to launch herself into the art world and moved to London, where she worked briefly as a department-store window dresser.\n\n\n=== Chicken Shack ===\nIn 1967, Perfect heard that Silvester and Webb were forming a blues band, to be called Chicken Shack, and were looking for a pianist. She contacted them and was invited to join the band as pianist, keyboard player and backing vocalist. Chicken Shack's debut release was \"It's Okay with Me Baby\", which was written by and featured Perfect. She stayed with the band for two studio albums, and her ge\n\"Crystal\" is a song by the British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac from their 1975 eponymous album. Written by Stevie Nicks, the song originally appeared on her and Lindsey Buckingham’s studio album, Buckingham Nicks (1973). Two years later, after joining Fleetwood Mac, it was re-recorded and released for a second time. In 1998, Nicks re-recorded the song with herself on lead vocals for the Practical Magic soundtrack.\n\n\n== Background ==\n“Crystal” first appeared on Buckingham Nicks, an album recorded by Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks in 1973 prior to their time in Fleetwood Mac. In her book Stevie Nicks: Visions, Dreams & Rumours, Zoë Howe stated that the Nicks wrote \"Crystal\" with her father and grandfather in mind. Despite being written by Nicks, the song was instead sung by Buckingham partially because producer Keith Olsen believed that his vocal timbre suited the song better. This version also featured an oboe at the end of each chorus.\nFollowing the additions of Buckingham and Nicks in Fleetwood Mac, the band opted to record another version for their 1975 eponymous release, again with Buckingham on lead vocals. For this recording, Christine McVie recorded the keyboard solo on a multimoog synthesizer. \"It wasn't even mine, though. There was some mad little professor guy running around twiddling all the knobs for me while I played it. I think he slept with the damn thing\". The band previewed the song during their Fleetwood Mac Tour prior to the album’s release.\nIn 1998, Nicks recorded another version of the song for the Practical Magic soundtrack, this time with herself on lead vocals. Bob Aguirre, who played drums in a band with Nicks during the early 1970s, said that he was “floored by the way she sang it” and gave Nicks a phone call to compliment her vocal performance.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nFleetwood Mac version\nLindsey Buckingham – lead vocals, guitar\nMick Fleetwood – drums\nChristine McVie – keyboards\nJohn McVie – bass guitar\nStevie Nicks – backing vocals\n\n\n== References ==\nThe Other Side of the Mirror is the fourth solo studio album by American singer and songwriter Stevie Nicks. Released on May 30, 1989, through the Modern Records label, the album was recorded in California, New York, and Buckinghamshire in England, and is loosely based around the theme of Lewis Carroll's novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865).\nThe album was a commercial success. It reached No. 10 on the US Billboard 200, propelled by the hit single \"Rooms on Fire\" (US No. 16), and achieved Platinum status for selling in excess of one million copies. The album reached No. 3 in the United Kingdom and was certified Gold there for sales in excess of 100,000. The Other Side of the Mirror is Nicks' highest charting album to date in various European countries including Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the huge success of Fleetwood Mac's album Tango in the Night (1987) in the United Kingdom, The Other Side of the Mirror became Nicks' highest-charting solo album there, reaching No. 3 and spawning her first UK Top 40 hit with \"Rooms on Fire\" (reaching No. 16), which Nicks performed on the BBC show Top of the Pops. The album was certified gold in the United Kingdom for sales in excess of 100,000 copies. Her first, and so far only, solo tour of the United Kingdom and Europe (including Sweden, France and the Netherlands), followed the album. There was also a US tour, though Nicks has famously since commented that she has no recollection of the tours due to her increasing dependency on the prescribed tranquilizer Klonopin at that time.\nIn the United States, \"Two Kinds of Love\" was released as a single, featuring vocals by Bruce Hornsby and an instrumental interlude by Kenny G, which became Nicks' first single to fail to chart, missing both the Billboard and Cash Box charts. However, \"Long Way to Go\" gained substantial airplay, making Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart, and it also made the Top 75 on the UK Singles Chart, as did \"Whole Lotta Trouble\". Promotional music videos were shot for \"Rooms on Fire\" and \"Whole Lotta Trouble\". The former was released with two slightly different edits, while the \"Whole Lotta Trouble\" video was shot during the American leg of Nicks' tour at the Summit Arena in Houston, Texas.\nAn earlier, instrumental version of the song \"Juliet\" (titled \"Book of Miracles\") was released by Fleetwood Mac in 1987 as the B-side to \"Seven Wonders\", while “Ooh My Love” was demoed for Tango in the Night but was ultimately shelved. The song \"Cry Wolf\" was originally recorded by American singer Laura Branigan for her fifth studio album Touch (1987).\nModern Records also released a special long-form interview video on the making of the album, titled \"Reflections from the Other Side of the Mirror\", which contained newly filmed material shot by Herbert Worthington III. However, it was limited to a worldwide release of 10,000 albums and only 500 VHS releases.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nDuncan Holland, reviewer of British music newspaper Music Week, praised the album. He wrote: \"This is a remarkably strong record from the single, \"Rooms on Fire\", to the 11 other tracks on show. Some rather overworked \"Alice in Wonderland\" imagery aside, this is excellent stuff, floating, melodic, twisting and turning.\" Pete Clark of Hi-Fi News & Record Review also found some warm words. He considered that this work is destined \"for those evenings when you just have to leave your brain at the door, there are worse things that can ooze into your ears.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMusicians\n\nStevie Nicks – vocals, percussion (1, 6), tambourine (2, 4, 5, 7, 10)\nRupert Hine – keyboards, percussion (1, 3, 4, 6), drum programming (3, 9, 11, 12), synth bass (9), bass (12)\nRick Nowels – guitars (1, 2, 4), acoustic guitar (1)\nJamie West-Oram – guitars (1-4, 6, 8, 9, 11)\nWaddy Wachtel – acoustic guitar (3, 7, 9, 12), guitars (6, 7, 10)\nMike Campbell – guitars (5, 6, 7), slide acoustic guitar \n\"Edge of Seventeen\" is a song by the American singer-songwriter Stevie Nicks from her debut solo studio album Bella Donna (1981), released as the third single from the album on February 4, 1982. The lyrics were written by Nicks to express the grief resulting from the death of her uncle Jonathan and the murder of John Lennon during the same week of December 1980. The song features a distinctive, chugging 16th-note guitar riff, drum beat and a simple chord structure typical of Nicks' songs. The song's title for the single release was \"Edge of Seventeen (Just Like the White Winged Dove)\". In the United States, \"Edge of Seventeen\" just missed out on the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 11. Despite this, it became one of Nicks' most enduring and recognizable songs and has been covered by several artists. In 2021, it was ranked No. 217 on Rolling Stone's list of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".\n\n\n== Background and inspiration ==\nAccording to Nicks, the title came from a conversation she had with Tom Petty's first wife, Jane, about the couple's first meeting. Jane said they met \"at the age of seventeen\", but Jane's strong Southern accent made it sound like \"edge of seventeen\" to Nicks. She liked the sound of the phrase so much that she told Jane she would write a song for it and give her credit for the inspiration.\nAlthough Nicks had originally planned to use the title for a song about Tom and Jane Petty, the death of her uncle Jonathan and the murder of John Lennon during the same week of December 1980 inspired a new song for which Nicks used the title. Nicks' producer and lover Jimmy Iovine was a close friend of Lennon, and Nicks felt helpless to comfort him. Soon after, Nicks flew home to Phoenix, Arizona, to be with her uncle Jonathan, who was dying of cancer. She remained with her uncle and his family until his death.\nNicks had never actually heard a dove's call before, as she revealed in 2020 when she had only just heard it recently. The opening lyrics were inspired by a menu she was reading at a Phoenix restaurant in 1980, which said, \"The white wing dove sings a song that sounds like she’s singing ooh, ooh, ooh. She makes her home here in the great Saguaro cactus that provides shelter and protection for her…\".\n\n\n== Composition and lyrics ==\nAs is typical of Nicks' songs, the lyrics are highly symbolic. Nicks has said that the white-winged dove represents the spirit leaving the body on death, and some of the verses capture her experience of the days leading up to her uncle Jonathan's death.\n\nThroughout the song, a distinctive 16th note guitar riff is played by Waddy Wachtel, progressing through C, D, and E-minor chords. During the bridge, the chords alternate twice between E-minor and C. Nicks's backing band recommended that they emulate The Police's \"Bring On the Night\" for the guitar riff, although Wachtel was unfamiliar with the song.\"I had never heard \"Bring On the Night,\" and at that session they told me they were going to do this song based on this feel. I had heard something about the Police, but I didn't know what they were talking about. Then about two years ago, I had the radio on, and on comes what sounds like \"Edge of Seventeen\" – and all of a sudden, there's Sting's voice! I thought, 'We ripped them off completely!' I called Stevie that night and said, 'Listen to me, don't ever do that again!'\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRecord World praised the song for its \"powerful lyrics, a percolating rhythm section and Stevie's throaty vocal.\" Author Zoe Howe has described the song as being about \"transforming and elevating the feelings of grief and soaring above them with strength\" and being \"a perfect combination of tough rock 'n' roll grit, raw emotion and full-beam, strut-about-in-platform-boots rock queen glamour.\"\nThe song is a favourite among Nicks' fanbase.\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\n\"Edge of Seventeen\" peaked at No. 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks in April 1982. The live version on the B-side \n\"Gypsy\" is a song by British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac. The song was written by Stevie Nicks around 1979; the earliest demo recordings were made in early 1980 with Tom Moncrieff for possible inclusion on her debut solo album Bella Donna. When Nicks' close friend Robin Anderson died of leukemia, the song took on a new significance and Nicks dedicated the song to her in future performances. \"Gypsy\" was the second single release and second biggest hit from the Mirage album, following \"Hold Me\", reaching a peak of No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks.\nIn 2017, Nicks recorded an acoustic version to serve as the theme song for the Netflix drama series Gypsy.\n\n\n== Inspiration ==\nLyrically, \"Gypsy\" recounts the narrator’s early adulthood—with references to going to a clothing store in San Francisco—and reminisces about a bygone, carefree lifestyle. There are two points of inspiration behind \"Gypsy\", as stated by Stevie Nicks, the first of which is a nostalgia for her life before Fleetwood Mac. Before joining the group, Nicks lived with Lindsey Buckingham, who would also join Fleetwood Mac. Nicks and Buckingham were musical and romantic partners; however, only their musical partnership has survived. Nicks met Buckingham at a high school party, where he was singing \"California Dreaming\" by the Mamas and the Papas. Nicks joined in with perfect harmony, then they introduced themselves. They did not see each other again until college where they started a relationship and a musical duo called Buckingham Nicks. They barely got by with the income from Nicks' work as a waitress and cleaning lady.\nThey could not afford a bed frame, so they slept on a mattress directly on the floor. Nicks says the mattress was decorated in lace, with a vase and a flower at its side. Whenever she feels her famous life getting to her, she goes \"back to her roots,\" and takes her mattress off the frame and puts it \"back to the floor\" and decorates it with \"some lace, and paper flowers.\" On 31 March 2009, Nicks gave an interview to Entertainment Weekly discussing the inspiration for the song:\n\nIn the old days, before Fleetwood Mac, Lindsey [Buckingham] and I had no money, so we had a king-size mattress, but we just had it on the floor. I had old vintage coverlets on it, and even though we had no money it was still really pretty... Just that and a lamp on the floor, and that was it—there was a certain calmness about it. To this day, when I'm feeling cluttered, I will take my mattress off of my beautiful bed, wherever that may be, and put it outside my bedroom, with a table and a little lamp.\nOn 25 March 2009, during a show in Montreal, Quebec on Fleetwood Mac's Unleashed Tour, Nicks gave a short history of the inspiration behind \"Gypsy\". She explained it was written sometime in 1978–1979, when the band had become \"very famous, very fast\". It was a song that brought her back to an earlier time, to an apartment in San Francisco where she had taken the mattress off her bed and put it on the floor. To contextualize, Nicks voiced the lyrics: \"So I'm back, to the velvet underground. Back to the floor, that I love. To a room with some lace and paper flowers. Back to the gypsy that I was.\" Those are the words: 'So I'm back to the velvet underground'—which is a clothing store in downtown San Francisco, where Janis Joplin got her clothes, and Grace Slick from Jefferson Airplane. It was this little hole in the wall, amazing, beautiful stuff—'back to the floor that I love, to a room with some lace and paper flowers, back to the gypsy that I was.'\"\nThe second point of inspiration for the song is the message as a tribute to someone's passing. On 5 October 1982, Robin Snyder Anderson, Nicks' best friend, died of leukemia.\n\n\n== Stevie Nicks and Robin Snyder Anderson ==\nNicks met and befriended Robin Snyder at Arcadia High School in Los Angeles when they were either 14 or 15. Snyder, who had theatrical interests, became Nicks' speech therapist. Videos of the two prep\n\"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\" is a song recorded by Stevie Nicks and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and released as the first single from Nicks' debut solo album Bella Donna (1981). The track is the album's only song that was neither written nor co-written by Nicks. Written by Tom Petty and Mike Campbell as a Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers song, Jimmy Iovine, who was also working for Stevie Nicks at the time, arranged for her to sing on it. Petty sings with Nicks in the chorus and bridge, while his entire band provides instrumentation with the exception of Ron Blair, who was replaced by bassist Donald \"Duck\" Dunn for the recording.\nA performance of the song in the studio was used as the promotional video. The video was the 25th video to be played on MTV's launch date on August 1, 1981. Petty and Nicks also sang together on the songs \"Insider\" (from Petty's album Hard Promises (1981)) and \"I Will Run to You\" (from Nicks's album The Wild Heart (1983)), and frequently performed impromptu live versions of these and 1960s classic \"Needles and Pins\" in many shows through the 1980s.\nAs of 2017, \"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\" remains a mainstay of Stevie Nicks's solo performances, and on July 9, 2017, Nicks performed the song together with Petty and the Heartbreakers at the British Summer Time festival at Hyde Park in London, in what turned out to be their final performance of the song together before Petty's death in October 2017.\nThe song peaked at No. 3 on the American Billboard Hot 100 for six consecutive weeks, (Nicks's biggest solo hit and the Heartbreakers' biggest hit as well). However, in the United Kingdom, the song only managed to peak at No. 50 on the UK Singles Chart. \n\n\n== Content ==\nIn a November 2003 interview with Songfacts, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers guitarist and primary songwriter Mike Campbell explained the song's origins:\n\n\"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\" was a song that I had written the music and Tom had written the words. The Heartbreakers had recorded a version of it with Jimmy Iovine, and Jimmy being the entrepreneur that he was, he was working with Stevie, and I guess he asked Tom if she could try it, and it just developed from there.\nWe cut the track as a Heartbreakers record and when she decided to do it we used that track and she came in and sang over it. It became a duet. It's basically all the Heartbreakers on that record.\nThe lyrics are about a woman who feels weighed down by relationships and wants to part despite a strong sentimental attachment to her lover. The melody is described by AllMusic as \"dark and sinister\". Apart from the intro before the first verse and a solo following the second verse (where there is some fairly heavy riffing), however, the guitar sound is laid-back in typical Heartbreakers style. The song was originally recorded for Petty's album Hard Promises, but the producers felt the song came from a female point of view and it was left unreleased until it was agreed to be put on the Bella Donna album instead. A demo version of the song, recorded without Nicks, was eventually released on Petty's boxed set Playback (1995).\nBillboard called it a \"punchy uptempo piece of rock.\"  Record World said that \"Nicks' uncompromising vocal pairs perfectly with Petty.\"\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nBand\n\nStevie Nicks – lead vocals\nLori Perry – backing vocals\nSharon Celani – backing vocals\nTom Petty – co-lead vocals, guitar\nMichael Campbell – lead guitar\nBenmont Tench – organ\nStan Lynch – drums\nAdditional musicians \n\nDonald \"Duck\" Dunn – bass guitar\nPhil Jones – percussion\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Cover versions ==\nThe song was parodied by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic as \"Stop Draggin' My Car Around\" on his debut album \"Weird Al\" Yankovic (1983).\nJimmy Fallon and Stevie Nicks performed the song in a humorous recreation of the 1981 music video on The Tonight Show on April 9, 2014.\n\n\n== References ==",

At the time, Nicks was a senior in high school and Buckingham, one year younger than she, was a junior. According to Nicks, they first met at a casual, after-school Young Life gathering in 1966. Nicks and Buckingham found themselves harmonizing to what some accounts claim was a Beach Boys song, although Nicks herself claims they sang \"California Dreamin',\" a hit single by the Mamas and the Papas, in an interview she gave with The Source in 1981. Nevertheless, Nicks and Buckingham did not collaborate again for another two years. In 1968 Buckingham invited Nicks to sing in Fritz, a band for which he was playing bass guitar and which included some of his high school friends.

So I joined the band, and within a couple of weeks we were opening for really big shows: Jefferson Airplane, Janis Joplin. All of a sudden I was in rock & roll."

Grace Slick of Jefferson Airplane, Janis Joplin of Big Brother and the Holding Company and Jimi Hendrix, whom Fritz also opened for, would all prove influential on Nicks and her developing stage persona. The band manager, David Forrester, worked hard to secure a record deal for Fritz, despite their sound differing from the harder, psychedelic music of their more popular contemporaries. The pair continued to perform with Fritz for three years until the band finally dissolved in 1971. Having developed a romantic relationship in addition to their working partnership, Nicks and Buckingham decided soon afterwards to move from San Francisco to Los Angeles to pursue their dreams of being signed."

There is one cover on the album, \"Carousel\", a song originally written and performed by Vanessa Carlton on her album Rabbits on the Run (2011). Nicks put it on the album because it was her mother's favorite song in her last days and Carlton was present during her death. Nicks was inspired to record the album after her assistant showed her bootlegs on YouTube of the demos Nicks had recorded over the years. Included on the album is \"Blue Water\", a song that features Lady A on vocals.\nThe album sold 33,000 copies in its first week of release and debuted at #7 on the Billboard 200, giving Nicks her sixth top ten album on that chart.\n\n\n== Release =="

It also reached the top spot in countries around the world and won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1978. Rumours has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums in history. Although each member of the band went through a breakup (John and Christine McVie, Buckingham and Nicks, and Fleetwood and his wife Jenny Boyd) while recording the album, they continued to write and record together."

Nicks' producer and lover Jimmy Iovine was a close friend of Lennon, and Nicks felt helpless to comfort him.
