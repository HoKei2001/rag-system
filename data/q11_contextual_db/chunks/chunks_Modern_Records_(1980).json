Its logo clearly stated the founding year to avoid confusion with the earlier Modern Records. The label had a distribution deal with Atlantic Records in the United States (also had international distribution with WEA and EMI) and Nicks was the biggest artist on the label, with other artists such as Joey Wilson, Jah Malla, Sandy Stewart, Poe, and Natalie Cole also having records released on the label. Modern Records folded in 1999. The record label was born out of necessity due to Warner Brothers refusing to sign Nicks as a solo act.  \n\n\n== Notable signed artists ==\nStevie Nicks\nRick Vito\nSandy Stewart\nJoey Wilson\nJah Malla\nPoe\nNatalie Cole\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nModern Records album discography from BSN Pubs.\nThis is a list of notable record labels, starting with I–Q. \n\nI–Q\n\n\n== I ==\n\n\n== J ==\n\n\n== K ==\n\n\n== L ==\n\n\n== M ==\n\n\n== N ==\n\n\n== O ==\n\n\n== P ==\n\n\n== Q ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of electronic music record labels\nList of independent UK record labels\nList of Bangladeshi record labels\n\n\n== External links ==\n45cat.com - record labels listed by country\ndiscogs.com - searchable by label\nThe Modern Lovers were an American rock band led by Jonathan Richman in the 1970s and 1980s. The original band existed from 1970 to 1974 but their recordings were not released until 1976 or later. It featured Richman and bassist Ernie Brooks with drummer David Robinson (later of The Cars) and keyboardist Jerry Harrison (later of Talking Heads). The sound of the band owed a great deal to the influence of the Velvet Underground and the Stooges, and is now sometimes classified as \"proto-punk\". It pointed the way towards much of the punk rock, new wave, alternative and indie rock music of later decades. Their only album, the eponymous The Modern Lovers, contained idiosyncratic songs about dating awkwardness, growing up in Massachusetts, love of life, and the USA.\nLater, between 1976 and 1988, Richman used the name Modern Lovers for a variety of backing bands, always billed as \"Jonathan Richman and The Modern Lovers\". These bands were quieter and featured more low-key, often near-childlike songs as Richman drew on folk-rock and other genres. Of Richman's original bandmates, only Robinson was part of any of the other Modern Lovers incarnations.\n\n\n== The original Modern Lovers, 1970–1974 ==\nRichman grew up in Natick, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, and began playing guitar and writing songs in his mid-teens, first performing solo in public in 1967. He became enamored of the Velvet Underground while he was still in high school, and after graduating in 1969, he moved to New York City where he became personally acquainted with the band and on one occasion opened the bill for them. Richman spent a couple of weeks sleeping on Velvets’ manager Steve Sesnick's sofa before moving into the Hotel Albert, a residence known for its poor conditions.\nAfter nine months in New York, and a trip to Europe and Israel, Richman moved back to his native Boston. With his childhood friend, guitarist John Felice, he organized a band modeled after the Velvets. They quickly recruited drummer David Robinson and bass player Rolfe Anderson, and christened themselves \"The Modern Lovers\". They played their first date, supporting Andy Paley’s band the Sidewinders, in September 1970, barely a month after Richman's return. By this time their setlist already included such noted Richman songs as \"Roadrunner\", \"She Cracked\" and \"Hospital\". Richman's unique character was immediately apparent; he wore short hair and often performed wearing a jacket and tie, and frequently improvised new lyrics and monologues.\nIn early 1971 Anderson and Felice departed; they were replaced by Harvard students bassist Ernie Brooks, and keyboardist Jerry Harrison, completing the classic lineup of the Modern Lovers. This new configuration became very popular in the Boston area, and by the fall of 1971, enthusiastic word-of-mouth led to the Modern Lovers' first exposure to a major label when Stuart Love of Warner Bros. Records contacted them and organized the band's first multi-track session at Intermedia Studio in Boston. The demo produced from this session, and the group's live performances, generated more attention from the industry, including rave reviews from critic Lillian Roxon, and soon A&M Records was interested in the band as well.\nIn April 1972, the Modern Lovers traveled to Los Angeles where they held two demo sessions: the first was produced by the Velvet Underground's John Cale for Warner Bros. while the second was produced by Allan Mason for A&M. These sessions were later used on the band's debut album. While in California the band also performed live, and one gig at the Long Branch Saloon in Berkeley was later issued as a live album. Producer Kim Fowley courted the band, traveling to Boston to produce some poor-quality demos in June 1972. Felice rejoined the group for a few months after his graduation, and the band moved together to live in Cohasset, Massachusetts.\nThe Modern Lovers continued to be a popular live attraction, and on New Year's Eve 1972 supported the New York Do\n\"Edge of Seventeen\" is a song by the American singer-songwriter Stevie Nicks from her debut solo studio album Bella Donna (1981), released as the third single from the album on February 4, 1982. The lyrics were written by Nicks to express the grief resulting from the death of her uncle Jonathan and the murder of John Lennon during the same week of December 1980. The song features a distinctive, chugging 16th-note guitar riff, drum beat and a simple chord structure typical of Nicks' songs. The song's title for the single release was \"Edge of Seventeen (Just Like the White Winged Dove)\". In the United States, \"Edge of Seventeen\" just missed out on the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 11. Despite this, it became one of Nicks' most enduring and recognizable songs and has been covered by several artists. In 2021, it was ranked No. 217 on Rolling Stone's list of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".\n\n\n== Background and inspiration ==\nAccording to Nicks, the title came from a conversation she had with Tom Petty's first wife, Jane, about the couple's first meeting. Jane said they met \"at the age of seventeen\", but Jane's strong Southern accent made it sound like \"edge of seventeen\" to Nicks. She liked the sound of the phrase so much that she told Jane she would write a song for it and give her credit for the inspiration.\nAlthough Nicks had originally planned to use the title for a song about Tom and Jane Petty, the death of her uncle Jonathan and the murder of John Lennon during the same week of December 1980 inspired a new song for which Nicks used the title. Nicks' producer and lover Jimmy Iovine was a close friend of Lennon, and Nicks felt helpless to comfort him. Soon after, Nicks flew home to Phoenix, Arizona, to be with her uncle Jonathan, who was dying of cancer. She remained with her uncle and his family until his death.\nNicks had never actually heard a dove's call before, as she revealed in 2020 when she had only just heard it recently. The opening lyrics were inspired by a menu she was reading at a Phoenix restaurant in 1980, which said, \"The white wing dove sings a song that sounds like she’s singing ooh, ooh, ooh. She makes her home here in the great Saguaro cactus that provides shelter and protection for her…\".\n\n\n== Composition and lyrics ==\nAs is typical of Nicks' songs, the lyrics are highly symbolic. Nicks has said that the white-winged dove represents the spirit leaving the body on death, and some of the verses capture her experience of the days leading up to her uncle Jonathan's death.\n\nThroughout the song, a distinctive 16th note guitar riff is played by Waddy Wachtel, progressing through C, D, and E-minor chords. During the bridge, the chords alternate twice between E-minor and C. Nicks's backing band recommended that they emulate The Police's \"Bring On the Night\" for the guitar riff, although Wachtel was unfamiliar with the song.\"I had never heard \"Bring On the Night,\" and at that session they told me they were going to do this song based on this feel. I had heard something about the Police, but I didn't know what they were talking about. Then about two years ago, I had the radio on, and on comes what sounds like \"Edge of Seventeen\" – and all of a sudden, there's Sting's voice! I thought, 'We ripped them off completely!' I called Stevie that night and said, 'Listen to me, don't ever do that again!'\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRecord World praised the song for its \"powerful lyrics, a percolating rhythm section and Stevie's throaty vocal.\" Author Zoe Howe has described the song as being about \"transforming and elevating the feelings of grief and soaring above them with strength\" and being \"a perfect combination of tough rock 'n' roll grit, raw emotion and full-beam, strut-about-in-platform-boots rock queen glamour.\"\nThe song is a favourite among Nicks' fanbase.\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\n\"Edge of Seventeen\" peaked at No. 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks in April 1982. The live version on the B-side \n\"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\" is a song recorded by Stevie Nicks and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and released as the first single from Nicks' debut solo album Bella Donna (1981). The track is the album's only song that was neither written nor co-written by Nicks. Written by Tom Petty and Mike Campbell as a Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers song, Jimmy Iovine, who was also working for Stevie Nicks at the time, arranged for her to sing on it. Petty sings with Nicks in the chorus and bridge, while his entire band provides instrumentation with the exception of Ron Blair, who was replaced by bassist Donald \"Duck\" Dunn for the recording.\nA performance of the song in the studio was used as the promotional video. The video was the 25th video to be played on MTV's launch date on August 1, 1981. Petty and Nicks also sang together on the songs \"Insider\" (from Petty's album Hard Promises (1981)) and \"I Will Run to You\" (from Nicks's album The Wild Heart (1983)), and frequently performed impromptu live versions of these and 1960s classic \"Needles and Pins\" in many shows through the 1980s.\nAs of 2017, \"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\" remains a mainstay of Stevie Nicks's solo performances, and on July 9, 2017, Nicks performed the song together with Petty and the Heartbreakers at the British Summer Time festival at Hyde Park in London, in what turned out to be their final performance of the song together before Petty's death in October 2017.\nThe song peaked at No. 3 on the American Billboard Hot 100 for six consecutive weeks, (Nicks's biggest solo hit and the Heartbreakers' biggest hit as well). However, in the United Kingdom, the song only managed to peak at No. 50 on the UK Singles Chart. \n\n\n== Content ==\nIn a November 2003 interview with Songfacts, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers guitarist and primary songwriter Mike Campbell explained the song's origins:\n\n\"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\" was a song that I had written the music and Tom had written the words. The Heartbreakers had recorded a version of it with Jimmy Iovine, and Jimmy being the entrepreneur that he was, he was working with Stevie, and I guess he asked Tom if she could try it, and it just developed from there.\nWe cut the track as a Heartbreakers record and when she decided to do it we used that track and she came in and sang over it. It became a duet. It's basically all the Heartbreakers on that record.\nThe lyrics are about a woman who feels weighed down by relationships and wants to part despite a strong sentimental attachment to her lover. The melody is described by AllMusic as \"dark and sinister\". Apart from the intro before the first verse and a solo following the second verse (where there is some fairly heavy riffing), however, the guitar sound is laid-back in typical Heartbreakers style. The song was originally recorded for Petty's album Hard Promises, but the producers felt the song came from a female point of view and it was left unreleased until it was agreed to be put on the Bella Donna album instead. A demo version of the song, recorded without Nicks, was eventually released on Petty's boxed set Playback (1995).\nBillboard called it a \"punchy uptempo piece of rock.\"  Record World said that \"Nicks' uncompromising vocal pairs perfectly with Petty.\"\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nBand\n\nStevie Nicks – lead vocals\nLori Perry – backing vocals\nSharon Celani – backing vocals\nTom Petty – co-lead vocals, guitar\nMichael Campbell – lead guitar\nBenmont Tench – organ\nStan Lynch – drums\nAdditional musicians \n\nDonald \"Duck\" Dunn – bass guitar\nPhil Jones – percussion\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Cover versions ==\nThe song was parodied by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic as \"Stop Draggin' My Car Around\" on his debut album \"Weird Al\" Yankovic (1983).\nJimmy Fallon and Stevie Nicks performed the song in a humorous recreation of the 1981 music video on The Tonight Show on April 9, 2014.\n\n\n== References ==\nThe 1980 Summer Olympics (Russian: Летние Олимпийские игры 1980, romanized: Letnije Olimpijskije igry 1980), officially known as the Games of the XXII Olympiad (Russian: Игры XXII Олимпиады, romanized: Igry XXII Olimpiady) and officially branded as Moscow 1980 (Russian: Москва 1980), were an international multi-sport event held from 19 July to 3 August 1980 in Moscow, Soviet Union, in present-day Russia. The games were the first to be staged in an Eastern Bloc country, as well as the first Olympic Games and only Summer Olympics to be held in a Slavic language-speaking country. They were also the only Summer Olympic Games to be held in a self-proclaimed communist country until the 2008 Summer Olympics held in China. These were the final Olympic Games under the IOC Presidency of Michael Morris, 3rd Baron Killanin before he was succeeded by Juan Antonio Samaranch, a Spaniard, shortly afterward.\nEighty nations were represented at the Moscow Games, the smallest number since 1956. Led by the United States, 66 countries boycotted the games entirely, because of the Soviet–Afghan War. Several alternative events were held outside of the Soviet Union. Some athletes from some of the boycotting countries (not included in the list of 66 countries that boycotted the games entirely) participated in the games under the Olympic Flag. The Soviet Union later boycotted the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The Soviet Union won the most gold and overall medals, with the USSR and East Germany winning 127 out of 203 available golds.\n\n\n== Host city selection ==\n\nThe only two cities to bid for the 1980 Summer Olympics were Moscow and Los Angeles. The choice between them was made at the 75th IOC Session in Vienna, Austria on 23 October 1974. Los Angeles would eventually host the 1984 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n== Participation and boycott ==\n\nEighty nations were represented at the Moscow Olympics, the smallest number since 1956. Of the eighty participating nations, seven National Olympic Committees made their first appearance at these Games: Angola, Botswana, Cyprus, Jordan, Laos, Mozambique and Seychelles. It was also the first time Vietnam participated after the end of the Vietnam War and the Reunification of Vietnam. None of these nations won a medal.\n29 countries boycotted the previous 1976 Summer Olympics in protest against the IOC for not expelling New Zealand, which had sanctioned a rugby tour of apartheid South Africa. The 1980 Summer Olympics were disrupted by another, even larger, boycott led by the United States in protest of the 1979 Soviet–Afghan War. The Soviet invasion spurred President Jimmy Carter to issue an ultimatum on 20 January 1980, which stated that the U.S. would boycott the Moscow Olympics if Soviet troops did not withdraw from Afghanistan within one month. 66 countries and regions invited did not participate in the 1980 Olympics. Many of these followed the United States' boycott initiative, while others cited economic reasons for not participating. Iran, under Ayatollah Khomeini hostile to both superpowers, boycotted when the Islamic Conference condemned the invasion. Neither the People's Republic of China nor Taiwan (Republic of China) participated in the games, the former as a consequence of the Sino-Soviet split.\nMany of the boycotting nations participated instead in the Liberty Bell Classic, also known as the \"Olympic Boycott Games\", in Philadelphia. Those that competed had won 71 percent of all medals and gold medals at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. This was in part due to state-run doping programs that had been developed in the Eastern Bloc countries. As a form of protest against the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, fifteen countries marched in the Opening Ceremony with the Olympic Flag instead of their national flags, and the Olympic Flag and Olympic Hymn were used at medal ceremonies when athletes from these countries won medals. Competitors from New Zealand, Portugal, and Spain competed under the flags of their \nThe Other Side of the Mirror is the fourth solo studio album by American singer and songwriter Stevie Nicks. Released on May 30, 1989, through the Modern Records label, the album was recorded in California, New York, and Buckinghamshire in England, and is loosely based around the theme of Lewis Carroll's novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865).\nThe album was a commercial success. It reached No. 10 on the US Billboard 200, propelled by the hit single \"Rooms on Fire\" (US No. 16), and achieved Platinum status for selling in excess of one million copies. The album reached No. 3 in the United Kingdom and was certified Gold there for sales in excess of 100,000. The Other Side of the Mirror is Nicks' highest charting album to date in various European countries including Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the huge success of Fleetwood Mac's album Tango in the Night (1987) in the United Kingdom, The Other Side of the Mirror became Nicks' highest-charting solo album there, reaching No. 3 and spawning her first UK Top 40 hit with \"Rooms on Fire\" (reaching No. 16), which Nicks performed on the BBC show Top of the Pops. The album was certified gold in the United Kingdom for sales in excess of 100,000 copies. Her first, and so far only, solo tour of the United Kingdom and Europe (including Sweden, France and the Netherlands), followed the album. There was also a US tour, though Nicks has famously since commented that she has no recollection of the tours due to her increasing dependency on the prescribed tranquilizer Klonopin at that time.\nIn the United States, \"Two Kinds of Love\" was released as a single, featuring vocals by Bruce Hornsby and an instrumental interlude by Kenny G, which became Nicks' first single to fail to chart, missing both the Billboard and Cash Box charts. However, \"Long Way to Go\" gained substantial airplay, making Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart, and it also made the Top 75 on the UK Singles Chart, as did \"Whole Lotta Trouble\". Promotional music videos were shot for \"Rooms on Fire\" and \"Whole Lotta Trouble\". The former was released with two slightly different edits, while the \"Whole Lotta Trouble\" video was shot during the American leg of Nicks' tour at the Summit Arena in Houston, Texas.\nAn earlier, instrumental version of the song \"Juliet\" (titled \"Book of Miracles\") was released by Fleetwood Mac in 1987 as the B-side to \"Seven Wonders\", while “Ooh My Love” was demoed for Tango in the Night but was ultimately shelved. The song \"Cry Wolf\" was originally recorded by American singer Laura Branigan for her fifth studio album Touch (1987).\nModern Records also released a special long-form interview video on the making of the album, titled \"Reflections from the Other Side of the Mirror\", which contained newly filmed material shot by Herbert Worthington III. However, it was limited to a worldwide release of 10,000 albums and only 500 VHS releases.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nDuncan Holland, reviewer of British music newspaper Music Week, praised the album. He wrote: \"This is a remarkably strong record from the single, \"Rooms on Fire\", to the 11 other tracks on show. Some rather overworked \"Alice in Wonderland\" imagery aside, this is excellent stuff, floating, melodic, twisting and turning.\" Pete Clark of Hi-Fi News & Record Review also found some warm words. He considered that this work is destined \"for those evenings when you just have to leave your brain at the door, there are worse things that can ooze into your ears.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMusicians\n\nStevie Nicks – vocals, percussion (1, 6), tambourine (2, 4, 5, 7, 10)\nRupert Hine – keyboards, percussion (1, 3, 4, 6), drum programming (3, 9, 11, 12), synth bass (9), bass (12)\nRick Nowels – guitars (1, 2, 4), acoustic guitar (1)\nJamie West-Oram – guitars (1-4, 6, 8, 9, 11)\nWaddy Wachtel – acoustic guitar (3, 7, 9, 12), guitars (6, 7, 10)\nMike Campbell – guitars (5, 6, 7), slide acoustic guitar \nAsha Bhosle is an Indian playback singer who has been cited by the Guinness Book of World Records as the most recorded singer in history.\n\n\n== 1940s ==\n\n\n=== 1948 ===\n\n\n=== 1949 ===\n\n\n== 1950s ==\n\n\n=== 1950 ===\n\n\n=== 1951 ===\n\n\n=== 1952 ===\n\n\n=== 1953 ===\n\n\n=== 1954 ===\n\n\n=== 1955 ===\n\n\n=== 1956 ===\n\n\n=== 1957 ===\n\n\n=== 1958 ===\n\n\n=== 1959 ===\n\n\n== 1960s ==\n\n\n=== 1960 ===\n\n\n=== 1961 ===\n\n\n=== 1962 ===\n\n\n=== 1963 ===\n\n\n=== 1964 ===\n\n\n=== 1965 ===\n\n\n=== 1966 ===\n\n\n=== 1967 ===\n\n\n=== 1968 ===\n\n\n=== 1969 ===\n\n\n== 1970s ==\n\n\n=== 1970 ===\n\n\n=== 1971 ===\n\n\n=== 1972 ===\n\n\n=== 1973 ===\n\n\n=== 1974 ===\n\n\n=== 1975 ===\n\n\n=== 1976 ===\n\n\n=== 1977 ===\n\n\n=== 1978 ===\n\n\n=== 1979 ===\n\n\n== 1980s ==\n\n\n=== 1980 ===\n\n\n=== 1981 ===\n\n\n=== 1982 ===\n\n\n=== 1983 ===\n\n\n=== 1984 ===\n\n\n=== 1985 ===\n\n\n=== 1986 ===\n\n\n=== 1987 ===\n\n\n=== 1988 ===\n\n\n=== 1989 ===\n\n\n== 1990s ==\n\n\n=== 1990 ===\n\n\n=== 1991 ===\n\n\n=== 1992 ===\n\n\n=== 1993 ===\n\n\n=== 1994 ===\n\n\n=== 1995 ===\n\n\n=== 1996 ===\n\n\n=== 1997 ===\n\n\n=== 1998 ===\n\n\n=== 1999 ===\n\n\n== 2000s ==\n\n\n=== 2000 ===\n\n\n=== 2001 ===\n\n\n=== 2002 ===\n\n\n=== 2003 ===\n\n\n=== 2004 ===\n\n\n=== 2005 ===\n\n\n=== 2006 ===\n\n\n=== 2007 ===\n\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\n\n== 2010s ==\n\n\n== Hindi non-film songs ==\n\n\n=== Hindi TV serial songs ===\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nPremchand, Manek (27 December 2018).

Written by Nicks and Rick Nowels, and produced by Rupert Hine, the song was released on April 24, 1989, by the Modern label, as the lead single from The Other Side of the Mirror. The 12-inch single was released in a limited-edition poster sleeve in certain territories.\n\"Rooms on Fire\" was successful on both sides of the Atlantic, reaching number 16 on the UK Singles Chart and on the US Billboard Hot 100 while topping the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. In the United Kingdom, it was Nicks' first solo top-forty hit and is her highest-charting song to date. The single was also highly successful in Canada and New Zealand, reaching numbers nine and 12 respectively.\nIn the accompanying music video for \"Rooms on Fire\", Nicks is seen holding a baby dressed in white, played by her goddaughter. \"Rooms on Fire\" was performed sporadically at Nicks' live concerts up until New Year's Eve of 1999, though it has yet to be played live since then. Nearly 30 years after original release, Nicks planned to sing \"Rooms on Fire\" on the 24 Karat Gold Tour, but the song was cut from the setlist.\n\n\n== Background and composition ==\nIn a 1989 interview, Nicks gave personal insight as to the meaning of \"Rooms on Fire\":\n\n\"Rooms on Fire is about a girl who goes through a life like I have gone through, where she finally accepts the idea that there never will be those other things in her life. She will never be married, she will never have children, she will never do those [that] part of life.\"\nThe song, according to the liner notes of Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks, was inspired by Nicks's brief relationship with Rupert Hine.\n\n\"The night I met Rupert Hine was a dangerous one. He was different from anyone else I had ever known...He was older, and he was smarter, and we both knew it. I hired him to do the album before we even started talking about music. It seemed that we had made a spiritual agreement to do a magic album...in a fabulous Dutch castle, at the top of the mountain. We recorded it in the formal dining room...where, upon the walls hung all these very old and expensive pieces of art...looking at us...we were never alone.\"\n\n\"It always seemed to me that whenever Rupert walked into one of these old, dark castle rooms, that the rooms were on fire. There was a connection between us that everyone around us instantly picked up on, and everyone was very careful to respect our space...our TIMESPACE, so we all lived at the castle for about four-and-a-half months. I went home with him to England to mix the album at his studio...he left in December. I joined him there in London in January. We left immediately for his studio, Farmyard Studios, somewhere outside London. It was like being in a cottage in Wales, it was a little spooky...the atmosphere was like nothing I had ever experienced. Then something happened to him that simply made it impossible for us to ever be together again. I left him there...the rooms were still burning, but the fire had been stolen from us. It wasn't over love, in fact...it had nothing to do with love. It was just a bad situation. I came back to Los Angeles, a very changed woman. And now, long nets of white...cloud my memory...Now I remember the rooms, the music, and how truly magic the whole thing was...\"\n\n\n== Track listings ==\nUS 7-inch and cassette single\n\n\"Rooms on Fire\" (7-inch remix) – 4:32\n\"Alice\" – 5:50\nInternational 7-inch single and Japanese mini-CD single\n\n\"Rooms on Fire\" – 4:20 (4:26 in Japan)\n\"Alice\" – 5:46 (5:41 in Japan)\nUK 12-inch, CD, and cassette single\n\n\"Rooms on Fire\" – 8:56\n\"Alice\" – 5:46\n\"Has Anyone Ever Written Anything for You?\" (live version) – 5:00\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nStevie Nicks – lead vocals, percussion\nLori Perry Nicks – backing vocals\nSharon Celani – backing vocals\nRick Nowels – guitars\nJamie West-Oram – guitars\nVail Johnson – bass guitar\nRupert Hine – keyboa\nModern Method Records was a record label that helped to document the Boston hardcore scene in the early 1980s. Modern Method was an offshoot of the Newbury Comics music retailer and also the Boston Rock magazine. The label was located at 268 Newbury ST. in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nHansa Records (also known as Hansa, Hansa Musik Produktion or Hansa International) was a record label based in Berlin, Germany founded in 1962.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the early 1960s, brothers Peter and Thomas Meisel, grandchildren of Will Meisel, who was the founder of German music publisher Edition Meisel & Co. GmbH, assumed responsibility of the family's publishing company upon their grandfather's retirement, and founded Hansa Musik Produktion company and the Hansa record label in 1962. The label's name (and the name of the related recording studio) was inspired by the Hanseatic League, a medieval Northern European maritime trade network.\nInitially, the label focused on German artists and Schlager music, later finding commercial success with artists such as Frank Farian's Boney M., Amii Stewart, Aneka, Modern Talking, Milli Vanilli, and others.\nIn 1977, the label signed an early lineup of The Cure (known at that time as Easy Cure), but wasn't happy with the band's demos and refused to release \"Killing an Arab\", suggesting that the band record cover songs instead. The band refused, and Hansa dropped them.\nIn the mid-1980s, after a decline in sales both domestically and internationally, Hansa Records was eventually purchased by Bertelsmann Music Group, who merged them with several other labels like Ariola-Eurodisc to form BMG Berlin Musik GmbH/BMG-Ariola, later to become part of international conglomerate Sony Music Entertainment, under which it was phased-out in 2009. It is used today only for reissues of its previous releases.\n\n\n== Recording studios ==\n\nWhen it became difficult for Hansa to book sufficient recording studio time at the Ariola-Eurodisc studio to keep up with their growing production schedule, the Meisel brothers built Hansa Studio One in Tiergarten in West Berlin. In 1972, the Meisel brothers acquired Ariola's historic building at Köthener Strasse 38, home of the historic Meistersaal concert hall, naming it Hansa Tonstudio Two. Initially intended to record only Hansa Records projects, Hansa's studios gradually started booking non-Hansa clients, most notably Iggy Pop and David Bowie, who in 1977 recorded their respective albums Lust for Life and Low at the studio. In the late 1970s they closed the first studio and consolidated operations to the second, simplify referring to it as Hansa Tonstudio. The Meisel family retained ownership of Hansa Tonstudio, who run it as part of the Meisel Music group.\n\n\n== Selected list of Hansa label artists ==\n\n\n== Selected list of Hansa label releases (by year) ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of record labels\n\n\n== References ==\nThe Modern Lovers is the debut studio album by American rock band the Modern Lovers. It was released on Beserkley Records in 1976, though the original tracks had been recorded in 1971 and 1972. Six of the original tracks were produced by John Cale. \nThe album has been featured three times on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and was included in Robert Dimery's book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Modern Lovers were formed in 1970 by teenage singer, songwriter, and guitarist Jonathan Richman. In early 1971, the band's membership was settled as Richman, Jerry Harrison (keyboards), Ernie Brooks (bass) and David Robinson (drums), with Richman's friend and original band member John Felice joining them occasionally on second guitar as his educational commitments allowed. By the autumn of 1971, through their live performances in Boston and New York, they had begun to attract the attention of several record company A&R men, including Stuart Love at Warner Brothers, and Allan Mason and Matthew Kaufman at A&M. The band made their first recordings for Warner Brothers at the Intermedia Studios in Boston in late 1971; these included the version of \"Hospital\" which was later to feature on the album.\nIn April 1972, the Modern Lovers travelled to Los Angeles where they held two demo sessions; the first was produced for Warner Brothers by John Cale, formerly of the Velvet Underground, while the second was produced by Allan Mason and Robert Appère for A&M. Both sets of sessions yielded tracks which, although originally recorded as demos, eventually found their way onto the album. The Cale sessions produced \"Roadrunner\", \"Astral Plane\", \"Old World\", \"Pablo Picasso\", \"She Cracked\" and \"Someone I Care About\". The A&M sessions yielded \"Girl Friend\", \"Modern World\" and \"Dignified and Old\" (which, although not included on the original LP, was included on later CD reissues).\nHowever, the band were initially undecided over which record company to sign for, returned to Boston, and also did some recordings organised by Kim Fowley and produced by Stuart \"Dinky\" Dawson. Eventually, in early 1973, they signed with Warner Brothers and agreed that John Cale should produce their debut album. In the meantime, they undertook a short residency at a hotel in Bermuda. Returning to California in the summer to work with Cale, it became apparent both that there were personality clashes between some of the band members, and that Richman now wanted to take a different approach to his songs - much more mellow and easy-paced rather than the earlier aggressive hard rock. The sessions with Cale were terminated before any new recordings were completed. Warner Brothers then engaged Kim Fowley to work with the band, but by this time Richman refused to perform some of his most popular earlier songs live. The band were also affected by the death during the sessions of their friend Gram Parsons: on the day before Parsons' death, he and Richman had played miniature golf and discussed recording together. The sessions with Fowley were aborted, although two tracks, \"I'm Straight\" and the original recording of \"Government Center\", and possibly others, were later issued on CD versions of The Modern Lovers. Warner Brothers withdrew support from the band, and, early in 1974, the original Modern Lovers split up.\n\n\n== Release ==\nIn late 1974, Richman signed as a solo artist with Matthew \"King\" Kaufman's new label, \"Home of the Hits\", soon to be renamed Beserkley Records, and recorded four tracks with backing by the bands Earth Quake and The Rubinoos, including new versions of both \"Roadrunner\" and \"Government Center\". These tracks were first issued as singles, and then on an album Beserkley Chartbusters Vol.1 in 1975. In 1976, with a new line-up of the Modern Lovers, Richman began recording what he went on to regard as his debut album, Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers.\nHowever, in the meantime, Kaufman also put toge\nLinton Kwesi Johnson OD (born 24 August 1952), also known as LKJ, is a Jamaica-born, British-based dub poet and activist. In 2002, he became the second living poet, and the only black one, to be published in the Penguin Modern Classics series. His performance poetry involves the recitation of his own verse in Jamaican patois over dub-reggae, usually written in collaboration with reggae producer/artist Dennis Bovell.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJohnson was born in Chapelton, a small town in the rural parish of Clarendon, Jamaica. His middle name, \"Kwesi\", is a Ghanaian name that is given to boys who, like Johnson, are born on a Sunday. In 1963 he and his father came to live in Brixton, London, joining his mother, who had immigrated to Britain as part of the Windrush generation shortly before Jamaican independence in 1962. Johnson attended Tulse Hill School in Lambeth. While still at school he joined the British Black Panther Movement, helped to organise a poetry workshop within the movement, and developed his work with Rasta Love, a group of poets and drummers.\nJohnson studied sociology at Goldsmiths College in New Cross, London, graduating in 1973. Speaking in a 2018 interview about his start as a poet, he said: \"I began to write verse, not only because I liked it, but because it was a way of expressing the anger, the passion of the youth of my generation in terms of our struggle against racial oppression. Poetry was a cultural weapon in the black liberation struggle, so that's how it began.\" During the early to mid-1970s he was employed as the first paid library resources and education officer at the Keskidee Centre, where his poem Voices of the living and the dead was staged, produced by Jamaican novelist Lindsay Barrett, with music by the reggae group Rasta Love. Johnson has recalled: \"it was fantastic, you know, having written something and having it staged with actors and musicians. That was back in 1973 before I had a poem published anywhere. That was before anyone had ever heard of Linton Kwesi Johnson.\"\nJohnson wrote for New Musical Express, Melody Maker, and Black Music in the 1970s. As a freelancer for Virgin Records he wrote biographies for their reggae artists, sleeve notes and copy for adverts.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Poetry ===\n\nMost of Johnson's poetry is political, dealing mainly with the experiences of being an African-Caribbean in Britain: \"Writing was a political act and poetry was a cultural weapon...\", he told an interviewer in 2008. However, he has also written about other issues, such as British foreign policy and the death of anti-racist marcher Blair Peach. Johnson wrote \"Reggae fi Dada\" on the death of his father in 1982, blaming social conditions. His most celebrated poems were written during the government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The poems contain graphic accounts of the racist police brutality occurring at the time (cf. \"Sonny's Lettah\"). Johnson's poetry makes clever use of the unstandardised transcription of Jamaican patois.\nJohnson's poems first appeared in the journal Race Today, which published his first collection of poetry, Voices of the Living and the Dead, in 1974. Dread Beat An' Blood, his second collection, was published in 1975 by Bogle-L'Ouverture.\nA collection of his poems has been published as Mi Revalueshanary Fren by Penguin Modern Classics. Johnson is one of only three living poets to be published by Penguin Modern Classics.\n\n\n=== Essays ===\nJohnson's essays, spanning 50 years (1976-2021), are collected in the volume Time Come (Picador, 2023). As described by Colin Grant, \"The writing is often flinty and flecked with passion; taut and reasoned, but on the edge of fury. ...the grace and power of LKJ's writing are as necessary as ever.\" Reviewing it in the Sunday Times, Tomiwa Owolade concludes: \"this volume emphasises the fact that Johnson is a dedicated cultural critic rather than simply an activist who happens to write dub poetry.\"\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nJohnson's best-known albums in\n1980 (MCMLXXX) was a leap year starting on Tuesday of the Gregorian calendar, the 1980th year of the Common Era (CE) and Anno Domini (AD) designations, the 980th  year of the 2nd millennium, the 80th  year of the 20th century, and the  1st   year of the 1980s decade.  \n\n\n== Events ==\n\n\n=== January ===\n\nJanuary 4 – U.S. President Jimmy Carter proclaims a grain embargo against the USSR with the support of the European Commission.\nJanuary 6 – Global Positioning System time epoch begins at 00:00 UTC.\nJanuary 9 – In Saudi Arabia, 63 Islamist insurgents are beheaded for their part in the siege of the Great Mosque in Mecca in November 1979.\nJanuary 14 – Congress (I) party leader, Indira Gandhi returns to power as the Prime Minister of India.\nJanuary 20 – At least 200 people are killed when the Corralejas Bullring collapses at Sincelejo, Colombia.\nJanuary 21 – The London Gold Fixing hits its highest price ever of $843 per troy ounce ($2,249.50 in 2020 when adjusted for inflation).\nJanuary 22 – Andrei Sakharov, Soviet scientist and human rights activist, is arrested in Moscow.\nJanuary 26 – Israel and Egypt establish diplomatic relations.\nJanuary 27 – Canadian Caper: Six United States diplomats, posing as Canadians, manage to escape from Tehran, Iran, as they board a flight to Zürich, Switzerland, on Swissair.\nJanuary 31 – Burning of the Spanish Embassy in Guatemala: The Spanish Embassy in Guatemala is invaded and set on fire, killing 36 people.

The song was not a chart hit, but the video did receive airplay on MTV in the early 1980s.\nMoore's career spanned decades and included teaching himself to play guitar, writing the lyrics to 1,000 original songs, forming multiple bands, and even starring in a few film roles. Moore's bands performed at well-known Los Angeles clubs, including Whisky a Go Go, The Troubadour, and Starwood, and headlined alongside The Police, The Knack, and The Motels. His memoir, It's Not a Rumour, published in 2021, chronicles his unorthodox story of making it big in music and life without ever making any money.\n\n\n== Early life, career beginnings ==\nMoore was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and aside from his family's brief move to San Francisco, California in 1966/67, grew up in the Twin Cities area. \"I didn't have any friends and really didn't want any. I just sat in my room and played Beatles songs and wrote my own,\" he claims. At this point, he was known as Rick Moore.\nHis family moved back to Richfield, Minnesota at the start of Freddy's Junior year in high school, his third high school in as many years. Right before the family's move, Freddy and his cousin, Danny Wick, had started a band called The Royal Cumquats. Moore  graduated from Richfield, Minnesota High School in 1968. Fearful that he would be drafted to serve in the Vietnam War, he enrolled at the University of Minnesota to study Music Theory and Composition under composer Dominick Argento.\nAfter performances with his band An English Sky, Moore started performing as Skogie, c. 1970.\nThe name Skogie took hold in PE class his senior year when Moore purchased a used official school PE t-shirt that had the name \"Skogie\" written on it. Being new to the school, Moore's classmates took to calling him by the name on his shirt. It stuck and became part of the inspiration for Moore's third and most successful Minneapolis band, Skogie and the Flaming Pachucos. Later, the band name reverted to Skogie. Moore wore his Skogie PE shirt to every gig and soon, he was referred to as Skogie. The name \"Flaming Pachucos\" was a nod to Moore's favorite composer, Frank Zappa, and his deep appreciation of the Pachuco culture of East Los Angeles.\nAround this time, Moore was married from 1971 to 1980 to his first wife Lucy.\nSkogie released a single in June 1972 with the help of producer/manager David Zimmerman (Bob Dylan's brother), and self-released a follow-up album in 1974. Creem magazine later named Skogie one of the first power pop bands.\n\n\n== Move to Los Angeles ==\n\nIn 1976, after national touring and recording experience at three Minneapolis studios, Moore decided to head to Los Angeles along with his wife and the rest of the band. While undergoing some personnel changes, the band changed their name to The Kats, and Moore invented a new on-stage persona for the act—a cat named Freddy.\nThat persona was formed from Moore's desire to write a rock opera about \"a guy who was always on the wrong side of where he wanted to be. A domestic cat who longed to be an alley cat but was too scared. Not an underdog, but an undercut. An underKat.\" That's how Skogie became Freddy Moore and his band became The Kats, just like the \"cool cats\" of the 1950s. Moore took his on-stage persona very seriously and often pantomimed being a cat.\nThe Kats signed a recording contract with Infinity Records in 1979, and recorded an album with Tom Petty's production team. However, just as final mixes were being completed Infinity Records was dissolved by its parent company MCA Records. The album was never released, and the master tapes remain locked in the Shelter Studios vault.\nAlso in 1979, Moore (then 29) met 16-year-old Demi Guynes at a nightclub. Almost immediately, despite Moore's existing marriage, the two beca\nGuinness World Records, known from its inception in 1955 until 1999 as The Guinness Book of Records and in previous United States editions as The Guinness Book of World Records, is a British reference book published annually, listing world records both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world. Sir Hugh Beaver created the concept, and twin brothers Norris and Ross McWhirter co-founded the book in London in August 1955.\nThe first edition topped the bestseller list in the United Kingdom by Christmas 1955. The following year the book was launched internationally, and as of the 2025 edition, it is now in its 70th year of publication, published in 100 countries and 40 languages, and maintains over 53,000 records in its database.\nThe international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums. The popularity of the franchise has resulted in Guinness World Records becoming the primary international source for cataloguing and verification of a huge number of world records. The organisation employs record adjudicators to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records.\nFollowing a series of owners, the franchise has been owned by the Jim Pattison Group since 2008, with its headquarters moved to South Quay Plaza, Canary Wharf, London, in 2017. Since 2008, Guinness World Records has orientated its business model away from selling books, and towards creating new world records as publicity exercises for individuals and organisations, which has attracted criticism.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nOn 10 November 1951, Sir Hugh Beaver, then the managing director of the Guinness Breweries, went on a shooting party in the North Slob, by the River Slaney in County Wexford, Ireland. After missing a shot at a golden plover, he became involved in an argument over which was the fastest game bird in Europe, the golden plover or the red grouse (the plover is faster, but neither is the fastest game bird in Europe). That evening at Castlebridge House, he realised that it was impossible to confirm in reference books whether or not the golden plover was Europe's fastest game bird. Beaver knew that there must have been numerous other questions debated nightly among the public, but there was no book in the world with which to settle arguments about records. He realised then that a book supplying the answers to this sort of question might prove successful. Beaver's idea became reality when Guinness employee Christopher Chataway recommended university friends Norris and Ross McWhirter, who had been running a fact-finding agency in London. The twin brothers were commissioned to compile what became The Guinness Book of (Superlatives and now) Records, in August 1954. A thousand copies were distributed for free to pubs across Britain and Ireland as a promotional asset for the Guinness brand, and they became immensely popular with customers.\nAfter the founding of The Guinness Book of Records office at the top of Ludgate House, 107 Fleet Street, London, the first 198-page edition was bound on 27 August 1955 and went to the top of the British bestseller list by Christmas. The following year, it was introduced into the United States by New York publisher David Boehm and sold 70,000 copies. Since then, Guinness World Records has sold more than 150 million copies in 100 countries and 40 languages.\n\nBecause the book became a surprise hit, many further editions were printed, eventually settling into a pattern of one revision a year, published in September/October, in time for Christmas. The McWhirters continued to compile it for many years. Both brothers had an encyclopedic memory; on the British children's television series Record Breakers, based upon the book, which was broadcast on the BBC from 1972 to 2001, they would take questions posed by children in the audience on various world records and were able to give the correct answer. Ross McWhirter was assassinated by two members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army \nThis is a list of career achievements by Wayne Gretzky in the National Hockey League (NHL). Upon his retirement on April 18, 1999, he was credited by the NHL Record Book with holding or sharing 61 NHL records, including 40 regular season, 15 playoff and 6 All-Star records. As of today, 24 seasons after retirement, he still holds or shares 57 of those NHL records.\nWinning four Stanley Cups (1984, 1985, 1987 ,1988), Gretzky set records in both regular season and post-season play, holding the record for most career regular season goals (894), assists (1,963), points (2,857) and hat-tricks (50). The next closest player in total points for the regular season is Jaromir Jagr at 1,921, thus he had more career assists than any other player has total points. \nGretzky scored his first 1,000 points faster (424 games) than any other player in NHL history, and scored the second 1,000 faster (433 games) than any player other than himself. His point total including regular season and playoffs stands at an imposing 3,239 (1,016 goals, 2,223 assists).\nGretzky still maintains the record for the most career playoff goals (122), assists (260), points (382), hat-tricks (10) and game-winning goals (24). His 47 playoff points in 1985 are still the most for a single postseason. His record of 31 playoff assists held for 36 years before being broken by Connor McDavid in game four of the 2024 Stanley Cup Finals.\n\n\n== Official record list ==\nThe following is a list of official records Gretzky held or shared at his retirement on April 18, 1999.\n\n\n=== Regular season records (40) ===\nMost goals: 894 in 1,487 games\nMost goals, including playoffs: 1,016 in 1,487 regular season games including 122 playoff goals\nMost goals, one season: 92 in 1981–82, 80-game schedule\nMost goals, one season, including playoffs: 100 in 1983–84, 87 goals in 74 regular season games and 13 goals in 19 playoff games\nMost goals, 50 games from start of season: 61 in 1981–82 (October 7 to January 22, 80-game schedule) and 1983–84 (October 5 to January 25), 80-game schedule\nMost goals, one period: 4 (tied with ten other players) February 18, 1981\nMost assists: 1,963\nMost assists, including playoffs: 2,223\nMost assists, one season: 163 in 1985–86, 80-game schedule\nMost assists, one season, including playoffs: 174 in 1985–86, 163 assists in 80 regular season games and 11 assists in 10 playoff games\nMost assists, one game: 7  (tied with Billy \"The Kid\" Taylor) February 16, 1980; December 11, 1985; February 15, 1986\nMost assists, one road game: 7 (tied with Billy \"The Kid\" Taylor)  December 11, 1985\nMost points: 2,857 in 1,487 games (894 goals, 1,963 assists)\nMost points, including playoffs: 3,239 in 1,487 regular season and 208 playoff games.

Written by Chas Sandford, the song was released as the lead single from the album in October 1985, through Modern Records. The single became a big hit for Nicks, peaking at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for two weeks and peaking at number one on the Billboard Top Mainstream Rock Songs chart for two weeks in 1985.\n\n\n== Background and composition ==\nThe song was written by Chas Sandford, who co-wrote John Waite's 1984 hit \"Missing You\". Sandford also plays most of the instruments on \"Talk to Me\". The song was brought to Nicks' attention by producer Jimmy Iovine, \"who was always on the hunt for a hit song.\" Nicks said she didn't like the song at first because she had trouble with the vocals, but Iovine persisted and she eventually recorded it. Jim Keltner was in the studio next door doing some drum overdubs during the recording process. After Nicks explained her dilemma, Keltner gave her some words of encouragement and offered to stay with her and be her audience. Nicks sang the song twice during the session and then it was finished.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nCash Box called it \"a mid-tempo rocker which makes good uses of Nicks’ throaty lead and harmony vocals.\"  Billboard said that it \"packs a real wallop.\"\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe promotional music video shows Nicks performing the song direct to camera in a variety of different sets in what looks like a grand house. One of the sets is a long white room that looks like an art gallery and has three steps in the middle which Nicks, her backing singers Sharon Celani and Lori Perry, and two male dancers, perform choreographed dance steps together. Nicks' brother, Christopher, features in the video playing the saxophone.\n\n\n== Live performances ==\n\"Talk to Me\" made its live debut on the Rock a Little world tour in 1986. It was also included on the Canadian leg of The Other Side of the Mirror tour set in 1989.

The single peaked at number 68 in the UK.\nA 3-track 12\" single was issued in the UK and Germany (but with differing picture sleeves), featuring the album version of the title track and \"One More Big Time Rock and Roll Star\" and \"Imperial Hotel\" as the B-sides.\nA 12-inch promo was released in the U.S. featuring a full-color glossy picture sleeve and additional inner sleeve, and the disc featured the title track in mono and stereo.\n\n\n== Other versions ==\nNicks re-recorded the song in 1986 for inclusion on the Time-Life compilation It's Only Rock and Roll.\nThe rock band Lovedrug included a live recording of \"Talk to Me\" on the fan-chosen covers album from the I AM LOVEDRUG campaign.

The current \"Women Only\" record of 2:16:16 was set by Peres Jepchirchir on April 21, 2024 at the London Marathon in the elite women's race.\n\n\n== History ==\nMarathon races were first held in 1896, but the distance was not standardized by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF, now World Athletics) until 1921.\nThe actual distance for pre-1921 races frequently varied from the 1921 standard of 42.195 km (26 miles 385 yards). In qualifying races for the 1896 Summer Olympics, Greek runners Charilaos Vasilakos (3:18:00) and Ioannis Lavrentis (3:11:27) won the first two modern marathons. On April 10, 1896, Spiridon Louis of Greece won the first Olympic marathon in Athens, Greece, in a time of 2:58:50. However, the distance for the event was 40,000 meters. Three months later, British runner Len Hurst won the inaugural Paris to Conflans Marathon (also around 40 km) in a time of 2:31:30. In 1900, Hurst would better his time on the same course with a 2:26:28 performance.\nLater, Shizo Kanakuri of Japan was reported to have set a world record of 2:32:45 in a November 1911 domestic qualification race for the 1912 Summer Olympics, but this performance was also run over a distance of approximately 40 km.\nThe first marathon over the official distance was won by American Johnny Hayes at the 1908 Summer Olympics, with a time of 2:55:18.4.\nIt is possible that Stamata Revithi, who ran the 1896 Olympic course a day after Louis, is the first woman to run the modern marathon; she is said to have finished in 5+1⁄2 hours. World Athletics credits Violet Piercy's 1926 performance as the first woman to race the standard marathon distance; however, other sources report that the 1918 performance of Marie-Louise Ledru in the Tour de Paris set the initial mark for women. Other \"unofficial\" performances have also been reported to be world bests or world records over time: although her performance is not recognized by World Athletics, Adrienne Beames from Australia is frequently credited as the first woman to break the three-hour barrier in the marathon.\nIn the 1953 Boston Marathon, the top three male finishers were thought to have broken the standing world record, but Keizo Yamada's mark of 2:18:51 is considered to have been set on a short course of 25.54 miles (41.1 km). The Boston Athletic Association also does not report Yamada's performance as a world best for this reason.\nOn October 25, 1981, American Alberto Salazar and New Zealander Allison Roe set apparent world bests at the New York City Marathon (2:08:13 and 2:25:29), however, these marks were invalidated when the course was later found to have been 151 meters short. Although World Athletics' progression notes three performances set on the same course in 1978, 1979, and 1980 by Norwegian Grete Waitz, the Association of Road Racing Statisticians considers the New York City course suspect for those performances, too.\nOn April 18, 2011, the Boston Marathon produced what were at that time the two fastest marathon performances of all time. Winner Geoffrey Mutai of Kenya recorded a time of 2:03:02, followed by countryman Moses Mosop in 2:03:06. However, since the Boston course does not meet the criteria for record attempts, these times were not ratified by the IAAF.\nEight IAAF world records were set at the Polytechnic Marath\nModern liberalism (often simply referred to in the United States as liberalism) is the dominant version of liberalism in the United States. It combines ideas of civil liberty and equality with support for social justice and a mixed economy.\nModern liberalism is one of two major political ideologies of the United States, with the other being conservatism. According to American philosopher Ian Adams, all major American parties are \"liberal and always have been. Essentially they espouse classical liberalism, that is a form of democratized Whig constitutionalism plus the free market. The point of difference comes with the influence of social liberalism\". Economically, modern liberalism supports government regulation on private industry, opposes corporate monopolies, and supports labor rights. Its fiscal policy opposes any reduction in spending on the social safety net, while simultaneously promoting income-proportional tax reform policies to reduce deficits. It calls for active government involvement in other social and economic matters such as: reducing economic inequality, increasing diversity, expanding access to education and healthcare, regulating economic activity, and environmentalism. Modern liberalism is a large and mainstream ideology in the Democratic Party and nation. Modern liberalism was formed in the 20th century in response to the Great Depression. Major examples of modern liberal policy programs include the New Deal, the Fair Deal, the New Frontier, the Great Society, the Affordable Care Act and the Inflation Reduction Act.\nIn the first half of the 20th century, both major American parties shared influential conservative and liberal wings. The conservative northern Republicans and Southern Democrats formed the conservative coalition which dominated the Congress from 1937 until the Johnson administration. After World War Two, northern Democrats began to support civil rights and organized labor, while voters and politicians in the formerly \"Solid South\" opposed them from within the Democratic Party. Following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, conservative Democrats began an exodus from the party, and supported Republican candidate Richard Nixon in 1968. By the 1970s the Democratic Party became predominately liberal and the Republican Party adopted conservatism as the party's main ideology. As a group, \"liberals\" are referred to as left or center-left and \"conservatives\" as right or center-right. Starting in the 21st century, there has also been a sharp division between liberals who tend to live in denser, more heterogeneous urban areas and conservatives who tend to live in less dense, more homogeneous rural communities, with suburban areas largely split between the two. Since the 2000 election, blue and red have been the party colors of the Democrats and Republicans respectively, in contrast to the use of blue for conservatism and red for leftism in the rest of the Western world.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe modern liberal philosophy strongly endorses public spending on programs such as education, health care, and welfare. Important social issues during the 21st century include social justice, economic inequality (wealth and income), voting rights for minorities, affirmative action, reproductive and other women's rights, support for LGBT rights, and immigration reform. Modern liberalism took shape during the 20th century, with roots in Theodore Roosevelt's Square Deal and New Nationalism, Woodrow Wilson's New Freedom, Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, Harry S. Truman's Fair Deal, John F. Kennedy's New Frontier and Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society. Modern liberals oppose conservatives on most but not all issues. Although historically related to social liberalism and progressivism, the current relationship between liberal and progressive viewpoints is debated. Modern liberalism is typically associated with the Democratic Party while modern conservatism is typically associated with the Republican Party.\nIn 1941, Fr\nModern Romance is a British pop music band that found popularity in the early 1980s. Formed in 1980 by previous members of an earlier group, the Leyton Buzzards, the band achieved a string of UK chart hits before the original group broke up in 1985. Andy Kyriacou reformed the band in 1999 who continue to perform the group's music.\n\n\n== Band history ==\nGeoffrey Deane and David Jaymes formed Modern Romance in 1980, having previously been the mainstays of the punk parody band the Leyton Buzzards which they formed in 1977.\nThe band split up in 1980 though Deane and Jaymes continued working together, embracing the burgeoning electronic style of dance music that was becoming popular in London clubs at the time. They found a new manager and created a limited company called Business Art Productions, and signed to WEA. In 1980, their first release, eponymously titled \"Modern Romance\", was unsuccessful. After a second unsuccessful single, \"Tonight\", the band then opted to lessen the predominantly electronic sound in favour of a Latin-American dance style with emphasis on bass, percussion and brass. They recruited trumpet player John Du Prez into their new line-up. The band released a new single, \"Everybody Salsa\" in summer 1981, which reached the UK Top 20. However, prior to the release, they recruited a new drummer, Andy Kyriacou, who began promoting the single with the band, and set up their first personal appearance in a club.\nThey followed this later in the year with similarly themed \"Ay Ay Ay Ay Moosey\", which reached the UK Top 10. Despite these two hits, the band's debut album, Adventures in Clubland, was not a success. However, in the US they scored a number 2 hit on the Billboard Dance chart with \"Can You Move\", a mostly rap variation of \"Everybody Salsa\". After further UK Top 40 hits with \"Queen of the Rapping Scene\" and a cover of the 1955 hit \"Cherry Pink And Apple Blossom White\", Deane departed the band in 1982 to pursue solo projects.\nMichael J. Mullins took over the mantle of lead vocalist, and their next release saw the band reach their highest UK chart position with \"Best Years of Our Lives\" in late 1982. Further hits followed in 1983: \"High Life\" (UK No. 8), \"Don't Stop That Crazy Rhythm\" (UK No. 14), and the ballad \"Walking in the Rain\" (UK No. 7). Both \"Best Years of Our Lives\" and \"Walking in the Rain\" earned Silver discs. Despite being regularly featured in teen pin-up magazines, the band's commercial hot streak waned and further singles were less successful. The band released a compilation album for the Christmas 1983 market entitled Party Tonight. Though it only peaked at No. 45 in the UK, it became their most successful album and was certified gold for sales in excess of 100,000 copies within six weeks of release.\nJohn Du Prez then left the band, and after disagreements with their record company, WEA, the band signed with RCA in 1984. This brought about a change of image – from bright coloured suits and wedge hairstyles to long hair and leather jackets. The band released a new single, a cover of The Temptations' 1971 hit \"Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me)\", but the single was not a success. Modern Romance released a final album, Burn It!, in 1985. The album was received poorly and the band called it quits after releasing the stand-alone single \"Tarzan Boy\" – a cover of the Baltimora hit from earlier that year – and an anthology mix of their biggest selling songs titled \"Best Mix of Our Lives\" (also 1985).\n\n\n== Post career ==\nAfter leaving Modern Romance, former lead vocalist Geoff Deane reappeared in 1983 as 'Geoff Deane & The Valley Girls' to release the single \"Navy Lark\", then again for the solo \"What About Romance\", and he also wrote \"You Think You're A Man\" for Divine. Deane later became a scriptwriter and television producer, scripting for television programmes such as Birds of a Feather, Babes in the Wood, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, Chef!, Last Man Standing, and A Many-Splintered Thing. In \nA phonograph record (also known as a gramophone record, especially in British English) or a vinyl record (for later varieties only) is an analog sound storage medium in the form of a flat disc with an inscribed, modulated spiral groove. The groove usually starts near the outside edge and ends near the center of the disc. The stored sound information is made audible by playing the record on a phonograph (or \"gramophone\", \"turntable\", or \"record player\").\nRecords have been produced in different formats with playing times ranging from a few minutes to around 30 minutes per side. For about half a century, the discs were commonly made from shellac and these records typically ran at a rotational speed of 78 rpm, giving it the nickname \"78s\" (\"seventy-eights\"). After the 1940s, \"vinyl\" records made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) became standard replacing the old 78s and remain so to this day; they have since been produced in various sizes and speeds, most commonly 7-inch discs played at 45 rpm (typically for singles, also called 45s (\"forty-fives\")), and 12-inch discs played at 33⅓ rpm (known as an LP, \"long-playing records\", typically for full-length albums) – the latter being the most prevalent format today.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe phonograph record was the primary medium used for music reproduction throughout the 20th century. It had co-existed with the phonograph cylinder from the late 1880s and had effectively superseded it by around 1912. Records retained the largest market share even when new formats such as the compact cassette were mass-marketed. By the 1980s, digital media, in the form of the compact disc, had gained a larger market share, and the record left the mainstream in 1991. Since the 1990s, records continue to be manufactured and sold on a smaller scale, and during the 1990s and early 2000s were commonly used by disc jockeys (DJs), especially in dance music genres. They were also listened to by a growing number of audiophiles. The phonograph record has made a niche resurgence in the early 21st century, growing increasingly popular throughout the 2010s and 2020s.\n\nPhonograph records are generally described by their diameter in inches (12-inch, 10-inch, 7-inch), the rotational speed in revolutions per minute (rpm) at which they are played (8+1⁄3, 16+2⁄3, 33+1⁄3, 45, 78), and their time capacity, determined by their diameter and speed (LP [long play], 12-inch disc, 33+1⁄3 rpm; EP [extended play], 12-inch disc or 7-inch disc, 33+1⁄3 or 45 rpm; Single, 7-inch or 10-inch disc, 45 or 78 rpm); their reproductive quality, or level of fidelity (high-fidelity, orthophonic, full-range, etc.); and the number of audio channels (mono, stereo, quad, etc.).\nThe phrase broken record refers to a malfunction when the needle skips/jumps back to the previous groove and plays the same section over and over again indefinitely.\n\n\n=== Naming ===\nThe various names have included phonograph record (American English), gramophone record (British English), record, vinyl, LP (originally a trademark of Columbia Records), black disc, album, and more informally platter, wax, or liquorice pizza.\n\n\n== Early development ==\nManufacture of disc records began in the late 19th century, at first competing with earlier cylinder records.  Price, ease of use and storage made the disc record dominant by the 1910s. The standard format of disc records became known to later generations as \"78s\" after their playback speed in revolutions per minute, although that speed only became standardized in the late 1920s.  In the late 1940s new formats pressed in vinyl, the 45 rpm single and 33 rpm long playing \"LP\", were introduced, gradually overtaking the formerly standard \"78s\" over the next decade.  The late 1950s saw the introduction of stereophonic sound on commercial discs.\n\n\n=== Predecessors ===\n\nThe phonautograph was invented by 1857 by Frenchman Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville. It could not, however, play back recorded sound, as Scott intended for people to read back\n4AD is a British record label owned by Beggars Group. It was founded in London under the name Axis Records by Ivo Watts-Russell and Peter Kent in 1980 as an imprint of Beggars Banquet Records. The name was changed to 4AD after the release of the label's first four singles. Later that year, Watts-Russell and Kent purchased the label from Beggars Banquet to become an independent record label, and Kent sold his share to Watts-Russell a year later.\nThe label gained prominence in the 1980s for releasing albums from alternative rock, post-punk, gothic rock, and dream pop artists, such as Bauhaus, Cocteau Twins, Modern English, Dead Can Dance, Clan of Xymox, Pixies, Throwing Muses, and Watts-Russell's own musical project This Mortal Coil. In 1987, the label scored an international hit with the dance music single \"Pump Up the Volume\" by the one-off project M|A|R|R|S. 4AD continued to have success in the 1990s and 2000s, with releases from The Breeders, Lush, Belly, Red House Painters, Camera Obscura, TV on the Radio, St. Vincent, and Bon Iver. As of January 2022, the label's current roster includes acts such as Dry Cleaning, The National, Daughter, Deerhunter, Big Thief, Aldous Harding, U.S. Girls, Erika de Casier, and Future Islands.\nIn 1999, Watts-Russell sold 4AD back to the Beggars Group. The label's history was detailed by Martin Aston in the book Facing The Other Way, released in 2013.\n\n\n== History ==\nIvo Watts-Russell and Peter Kent, employees of the Beggars Banquet record store and label, founded Axis Records (named after the Jimi Hendrix album) in late 1979 as a property of Beggars Banquet, that was run by the two of them. After the first four Axis singles in early 1980, it became apparent that the name Axis was already being used by another music company and the name was changed to 4AD, an abbreviation of the word forward. Other names which they had considered included 1980AD, 4WD and 1984.\nAn initial idea for the label was that it would be a \"testing ground\" for Beggars Banquet; successful acts would graduate up to Beggars Banquet after a year at 4AD. The only band to follow this path would be Bauhaus, who were signed to Beggars Banquet in late 1980, before Watts-Russell and Kent purchased the label outright.\nThe two were the sole owners for about a year. Kent sold his share to Watts-Russell at the end of 1981, and started a new Beggars Banquet subsidiary, Situation Two Records. Watts-Russell would maintain ownership of the label, and act as its president, until the late 1990s.\nWatts-Russell invited the graphic designer Vaughan Oliver and the photographer Nigel Grierson to create sleeve art for the label, and as a result, 4AD acquired a visually distinctive identity. Its artists, such as Cocteau Twins and Dead Can Dance, developed cult followings in the mid-1980s, but 4AD continued to evolve, and, after signing Throwing Muses and Pixies, the label increasingly concentrated on underground American rock music. In 1983, 4AD had a minor hit in America with the Modern English single \"I Melt With You\". In 1987, 4AD had a UK number-one hit with the collaged \"Pump up the Volume\" by M|A|R|R|S (licensed to 4th & B'Way/Island Records in the US).\nIn the 1990s, 4AD established an office in Los Angeles and had success with bands such as The Breeders, Belly, Red House Painters, Unrest and His Name Is Alive, as well as solo material by Frank Black and Kristin Hersh.\nThe label's deal with Warner Bros. Records in the United States in 1992 would start the beginning of a new phase in 4AD history. New signings that year included American underground acts Kendra Smith, Tarnation, Air Miami and The Amps. The following year Watts-Russell started a sub-label, Guernica, which would release records by Unrest, That Dog, and Bettie Serveert.\nIn 1999, Watts-Russell sold his share in 4AD back to the Beggars Group (as it had by then become), but the label continued to release music and add new artists to its roster.

Nicks' producer and lover Jimmy Iovine was a close friend of Lennon, and Nicks felt helpless to comfort him. Soon after, Nicks flew home to Phoenix, Arizona, to be with her uncle Jonathan, who was dying of cancer. She remained with her uncle and his family until his death."

The label's name (and the name of the related recording studio) was inspired by the Hanseatic League, a medieval Northern European maritime trade network.\nInitially, the label focused on German artists and Schlager music, later finding commercial success with artists such as Frank Farian's Boney M., Amii Stewart, Aneka, Modern Talking, Milli Vanilli, and others.\nIn 1977, the label signed an early lineup of The Cure (known at that time as Easy Cure), but wasn't happy with the band's demos and refused to release \"Killing an Arab\", suggesting that the band record cover songs instead. The band refused, and Hansa dropped them."

Initially intended to record only Hansa Records projects, Hansa's studios gradually started booking non-Hansa clients, most notably Iggy Pop and David Bowie, who in 1977 recorded their respective albums Lust for Life and Low at the studio.

Johnson has recalled: \"it was fantastic, you know, having written something and having it staged with actors and musicians. That was back in 1973 before I had a poem published anywhere.

I just sat in my room and played Beatles songs and wrote my own,\" he claims. At this point, he was known as Rick Moore.\nHis family moved back to Richfield, Minnesota at the start of Freddy's Junior year in high school, his third high school in as many years. Right before the family's move, Freddy and his cousin, Danny Wick, had started a band called The Royal Cumquats. Moore  graduated from Richfield, Minnesota High School in 1968. Fearful that he would be drafted to serve in the Vietnam War, he enrolled at the University of Minnesota to study Music Theory and Composition under composer Dominick Argento.\nAfter performances with his band An English Sky, Moore started performing as Skogie, c. 1970."

It stuck and became part of the inspiration for Moore's third and most successful Minneapolis band, Skogie and the Flaming Pachucos. Later, the band name reverted to Skogie. Moore wore his Skogie PE shirt to every gig and soon, he was referred to as Skogie. The name \"Flaming Pachucos\" was a nod to Moore's favorite composer, Frank Zappa, and his deep appreciation of the Pachuco culture of East Los Angeles.\nAround this time, Moore was married from 1971 to 1980 to his first wife Lucy."

A domestic cat who longed to be an alley cat but was too scared. Not an underdog, but an undercut. An underKat.\" That's how Skogie became Freddy Moore and his band became The Kats, just like the \"cool cats\" of the 1950s.

Beaver knew that there must have been numerous other questions debated nightly among the public, but there was no book in the world with which to settle arguments about records.
