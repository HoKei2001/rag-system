The film stars Hailee Steinfeld, Woody Harrelson, Kyra Sedgwick, and Haley Lu Richardson.\nThe film premiered at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival on September 16, 2016, and was theatrically released on November 18, 2016, by STXfilms.\nIt received positive reviews, with Steinfeld's performance being critically acclaimed. The film grossed more than $19.4 million against a budget of $9 million.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nSeventeen-year-old Nadine Franklin has tempestuous relationships with her popular older brother Darian and her image-conscious mother Mona but was close to her late father Tom. He died of a heart attack when Nadine was thirteen, and her best friend Krista is the only person keeping her buoyed.\nMona travels to the Oregon Coast to meet a boyfriend, and in her absence, Nadine and Krista get extremely drunk. Darian throws a pool party at the house and, after throwing up, Nadine falls asleep while Krista talks to Darian. The next morning, Nadine finds Krista with Darian in bed, straining the girls' friendship. \nThe next day at school, Krista insists Nadine join her at a house party to which Darian has invited her. When they arrive, Darian introduces Krista to other students, leaving Nadine on her own. After failed attempts at mingling, Nadine sits outside with another partygoer, who remarks how inferior Nadine seems compared to her brother, and Nadine leaves the party.\nNadine turns to her classmate Erwin Kim, who has a crush on her. She is attracted to older student Nick Mossman and makes inept attempts to attract him. She invites Erwin to an amusement park, but she rejects his attempt to kiss her. At the end of the night, Nadine tells him he is a great guy and they become friends.\nAt school, Krista confronts Nadine for ignoring her, and Nadine says Darian does not care about Krista and will soon drop her. Krista retorts that Darian has asked her to be his girlfriend and to prom, which is months away. Insecure and desperate, Nadine says Krista must choose between her or Darian. When she refuses to do so, Nadine ends their friendship.\nFor support at school, Nadine turns to world-weary teacher Mr. Bruner, who says she is his favorite student to cheer her up. Nadine goes swimming in Erwin's pool and finds his house is luxurious and his family is wealthy. She learns Erwin is a talented animation filmmaker and accepts his invitation to their school's short-film festival.\nMona has been giving Nadine a ride to school since her falling out with Krista. One day, Nadine refuses to get out of the car when she sees Krista arriving at school at the same time, which leads to Mona bringing Nadine to work with her. There, they argue about her father, and Nadine steals Mona's car. She drives to a playground, writes a sexually explicit text to Nick, and accidentally sends it.\nNadine drives to school and flippantly tells Mr. Bruner she is going to kill herself, and he tries to reassure her. Nick replies to her text, asking her to hang out. Mona calls Darian while he is with Krista and some friends, telling him that Nadine is missing. Darian and Krista leave to find her. \nNick, having taken Nadine's explicit text seriously, attempts to have sex with her in his car. Rejecting him, Nadine runs away and calls Mr. Bruner, who takes her back to his house where they wait for Darian to arrive. Nadine meets Mr. Bruner's wife and child there. Darian tells Nadine he has suffered from the pressures of taking their father's place, saying he feels trapped and did not apply to distant colleges because their mother is so dependent on him. The only person who makes him happy is Krista, but he dislikes that it destroys Nadine for him to be with Krista. Darian asks Mr. Bruner to give Nadine a ride home. Back at their house, Nadine tells Darian about her own feelings of self-hatred and envy. They hug, ending their feud.\n\"Edge of Seventeen\" is a song by the American singer-songwriter Stevie Nicks from her debut solo studio album Bella Donna (1981), released as the third single from the album on February 4, 1982. The lyrics were written by Nicks to express the grief resulting from the death of her uncle Jonathan and the murder of John Lennon during the same week of December 1980. The song features a distinctive, chugging 16th-note guitar riff, drum beat and a simple chord structure typical of Nicks' songs. The song's title for the single release was \"Edge of Seventeen (Just Like the White Winged Dove)\". In the United States, \"Edge of Seventeen\" just missed out on the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 11. Despite this, it became one of Nicks' most enduring and recognizable songs and has been covered by several artists. In 2021, it was ranked No. 217 on Rolling Stone's list of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".\n\n\n== Background and inspiration ==\nAccording to Nicks, the title came from a conversation she had with Tom Petty's first wife, Jane, about the couple's first meeting. Jane said they met \"at the age of seventeen\", but Jane's strong Southern accent made it sound like \"edge of seventeen\" to Nicks. She liked the sound of the phrase so much that she told Jane she would write a song for it and give her credit for the inspiration.\nAlthough Nicks had originally planned to use the title for a song about Tom and Jane Petty, the death of her uncle Jonathan and the murder of John Lennon during the same week of December 1980 inspired a new song for which Nicks used the title. Nicks' producer and lover Jimmy Iovine was a close friend of Lennon, and Nicks felt helpless to comfort him. Soon after, Nicks flew home to Phoenix, Arizona, to be with her uncle Jonathan, who was dying of cancer. She remained with her uncle and his family until his death.\nNicks had never actually heard a dove's call before, as she revealed in 2020 when she had only just heard it recently. The opening lyrics were inspired by a menu she was reading at a Phoenix restaurant in 1980, which said, \"The white wing dove sings a song that sounds like she’s singing ooh, ooh, ooh. She makes her home here in the great Saguaro cactus that provides shelter and protection for her…\".\n\n\n== Composition and lyrics ==\nAs is typical of Nicks' songs, the lyrics are highly symbolic. Nicks has said that the white-winged dove represents the spirit leaving the body on death, and some of the verses capture her experience of the days leading up to her uncle Jonathan's death.\n\nThroughout the song, a distinctive 16th note guitar riff is played by Waddy Wachtel, progressing through C, D, and E-minor chords. During the bridge, the chords alternate twice between E-minor and C. Nicks's backing band recommended that they emulate The Police's \"Bring On the Night\" for the guitar riff, although Wachtel was unfamiliar with the song.\"I had never heard \"Bring On the Night,\" and at that session they told me they were going to do this song based on this feel. I had heard something about the Police, but I didn't know what they were talking about. Then about two years ago, I had the radio on, and on comes what sounds like \"Edge of Seventeen\" – and all of a sudden, there's Sting's voice! I thought, 'We ripped them off completely!' I called Stevie that night and said, 'Listen to me, don't ever do that again!'\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRecord World praised the song for its \"powerful lyrics, a percolating rhythm section and Stevie's throaty vocal.\" Author Zoe Howe has described the song as being about \"transforming and elevating the feelings of grief and soaring above them with strength\" and being \"a perfect combination of tough rock 'n' roll grit, raw emotion and full-beam, strut-about-in-platform-boots rock queen glamour.\"\nThe song is a favourite among Nicks' fanbase.\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\n\"Edge of Seventeen\" peaked at No. 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks in April 1982. The live version on the B-side \nEdge of Seventeen is a 1998 coming of age romantic comedy-drama film directed by David Moreton, written by Moreton and Todd Stephens, starring Chris Stafford, and co-starring Tina Holmes and Andersen Gabrych.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nSandusky, Ohio, 1984: Eric Hunter is a Eurythmics-obsessed, musically driven teenager coming to terms with his sexual identity. When Eric and his best friend, Maggie, accept summer jobs in food service at the local amusement park, they befriend their lesbian manager, Angie, and gay college student, Rod. Sparks fly between the two boys, even as Maggie waits patiently in the wings for Eric's affections. Eric and Rod eventually go on a date that ends at a motel, but then Rod promptly heads back to Ohio State. The encounter leaves Eric with mixed feelings, but he is now more sure of his sexuality.\nAfter beginning his senior year of high school, Eric starts to change up his appearance by letting Maggie dye the top half of his hair blonde, and wearing edgier and more effeminate clothes. This raises eyebrows with his loving parents, but Eric learns that his mom is going to get a part-time job at a local movie multiplex to help send him to study music in New York. While at a party with Maggie, several guys from their school call Eric gay slurs that cause him to leave. Later that night, Eric ventures out to the local gay disco \"The Universal\", a hopping joint run by none other than his old boss, Angie, who tells him not to worry about what everyone else thinks. He dances with a guy who takes him out to his car where the guy gives Eric a rim job, but then leaves shortly afterwards. Stung by a meaningless sexual experience, he calls Rod, who at first seems happy to hear from him, but then tells Eric that he probably shouldn't call him anymore. Eric then goes to Maggie's house where he finally tells her that he is gay. Maggie does not seem to be that surprised since she suspected Eric's relationship with Rod, but she comforts him nevertheless.\nEric starts visiting the bar frequently, where he feels accepted by Angie and her close circle of friends. While waiting to meet up with Maggie one night, Eric clicks with a local college student named Jonathan. When Maggie finally comes to the club, she is heckled by Angie's friends for being Eric's \"fag hag\", and leaves. Eric follows Maggie, but she is upset at him for previously leading her on. Eric goes back to the club to find Jonathan, only to discover that he is already gone. He goes to the Ohio State dorms in hopes of finding him, but decides to find Rod instead. They go back to Rod's room where they have sex. Eric is shown to be uncomfortable during it, and leaves after Rod falls asleep.\nWhen Eric goes home, he is ambushed by his mother, Bonnie, about his recent behavior and appearance, and says that people are getting the wrong idea about him. Eric leaves, and goes to see Angie. While at her house, Angie explains to Eric that it is difficult to accept yourself for who you really are, and that he should give himself some time. He reconciles with Maggie, but quickly realizes that it was a mistake after sleeping together. Crestfallen at his rejection and his willingness to toy with her affections, Maggie ends the friendship. After she leaves, Eric's mother confronts him about a pair of matches she found in his clothes that were from the bar. He quickly denies ever going to the Universal, and leaves. When Eric finally comes home, he finds his mother playing on the piano. He comes out to her; feeling a weight being lifted off his shoulders.\nEric later goes back to the bar just as Angie begins to sing. The film ends with Eric and Jonathan reunited as they watch Angie perform. It is loosely implied that after high school, he will go off to New York City for college and live the life he wants to live.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nChris Stafford as Eric Hunter\nTina Holmes as Maggie\nAndersen Gabrych as Rod\nStephanie McVay as Bonnie Hunter\nLea DeLaria as Angie\nTony Maietta as Gregg\nBarbie Marie as \nHaley Lu Richardson (born March 7, 1995) is an American actress.

Released on July 27, 1981, the album peaked at number one on the US Billboard 200 in September of that year. Bella Donna was awarded platinum status by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on October 7, 1981, less than three months after its release, and in 1990 was certified quadruple-platinum for four million copies shipped. Bella Donna spent nearly three years on the Billboard 200, from July 1981 to June 1984.\nThe album spawned four hit singles during 1981 and 1982: the Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers-penned duet \"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\" (number 3), the Don Henley duet \"Leather and Lace\" (number 6), along with \"Edge of Seventeen\" (number 11) and the country-tinged \"After the Glitter Fades\" (number 32).\nBella Donna would mark the beginning of Nicks' trend of calling upon her many musician friends and connections to fully realize her sparse demo recordings. Along with friends Tom Petty and Don Henley, Nicks brought in session musician Waddy Wachtel, Bruce Springsteen's E-Street Band pianist Roy Bittan, and Stax session man Donald \"Duck\" Dunn of Booker T. & the MGs. The album marked the first recording featuring Nicks' backing vocalists, Sharon Celani and Lori Perry, who still record and tour with Nicks today.\nThe album was also included in the \"Greatest of All Time Billboard 200 Albums\" chart.\n\n\n== History ==\nNicks began work on Bella Donna in 1979, in between sessions for Fleetwood Mac's Tusk album, released in October that year. Nicks recorded various demo versions of songs in early and mid-1980 but these recordings were not used on the album. Following the end of the Tusk tour on September 1, 1980, work with a full band commenced under producer Jimmy Iovine.\nNicks recalled that the album was recorded piecemeal since several of the session musicians, including Waddy Watchel and Russ Kunkel, were operating under a tight schedule. \"We didn't put on 50,000 guitars because we didn't have Waddy around long enough to do 50,000 guitar overdubs. We were lucky to get him to do one guitar part.\" The Bella Donna recording sessions also presented Nicks with an opportunity to work on arrangements without Lindsey Buckingham, who extensively assisted with arrangements on her Fleetwood Mac material. For Bella Donna, Nicks instead allowed the session musicians to develop their own ideas for the instrumentation based on the demos she created.\nRecording sessions continued until the spring of 1981 when the final songs for the album were completed: \"Edge of Seventeen\" and \"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\". The 10-song, 42-minute album Bella Donna was released in the summer of 1981. Nicks wrote \"Think About It\" for her friend and Fleetwood Mac bandmate Christine McVie during the Rumours recording sessions, but the song was never completed until Bella Donna. After the Glitter Fades was Nicks' oldest song on the record, having been written in 1972, while \"Think About It\", \"Leather and Lace\", and \"Highway Man\" were written in 1975.\nA number of finished songs did not make it on the album, including \"Blue Lamp\", which was released instead on Heavy Metal soundtrack later in 1981, and \"Sleeping Angel\", released on the Fast Times at Ridgemont High soundtrack in 1982. These two songs were included on Nicks' Enchanted boxed set in 1998, along with another unused Bella Donna session song, \"Gold and Braid\". Three more songs from these sessions, \"If You Were My Love\", \"Belle Fleur\" and \"The Dealer\", were finally released on Nicks' album 24 Karat Gold: Songs from the Vault (2014). In total, Nicks recorded 16 songs for the album, of which ten were selected for Bella Donna.\nOn her Enchanted boxed set release in 1998, remastered versions of some Bella Donna tracks ran noticeably longer in some instances, notably \"Leather and Lace\". Video footage of the album sessions can be found on the DVD portion of Nicks' retrospective release Crystal Visions – The \nHailee Steinfeld (born December 11, 1996) is an American actress, singer and songwriter.

She is known for writing and directing the 2016 coming-of-age dramedy The Edge of Seventeen and the 2023 adaptation of Judy Blume's classic middle-grade novel, Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nFremon Craig was born in Whittier, California and graduated from UC Irvine with an English degree. When she was 13, she watched a lot of MTV, which sparked her interest in music videos. She stated that music videos were \"like little short films\". Spoken word poetry was what Fremon Craig initially began writing.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2000s ===\n\nFremon Craig started out by writing sketch comedy and spoken word poetry in college, then landed an internship in the film division of Immortal Entertainment, where she read her first film script and began to pursue screenwriting. She developed several screenplays during the 2000s, including a modern high school retelling of  Cyrano de Bergerac and a comedic remake of the 2004 French drama Intimate Strangers for Paramount Pictures. One of her scripts, Ticket to Ride, caught the attention of Ghostbusters director Ivan Reitman. He bought the script under his The Montecito Picture Company as a directing vehicle for himself. According to Reitman, the script was rewritten at least 15 times. The film was released, under the new title Post Grad and was instead directed by Shrek director Vicky Jenson. Post Grad was released in 2009 to critical and commercial disappointment.\n\n\n=== 2010s ===\nIn 2011 Fremon Craig completed another script titled Besties and sent the script to James L. Brooks. Brooks bought the script and it was announced that Fremon Craig would direct the film and Brooks would serve as a producer and mentor for her first film. No updates were issued for the feature until August 2015, when Hailee Steinfeld was announced to star in the film. Casting continued until October of that same year, with filming commencing that same month. \nThe film was released by STX Entertainment in fall 2016 under its new title The Edge of Seventeen to critical praise and it was a modest financial hit. Fremon Craig kept a series of journals that helped inspire her while writing The Edge of Seventeen. She took some of these journal entries and formed them into the script. For research on the film and script, Fremon Craig went to high schools and hung out with teenagers to better understand what their lives were like. Fremon Craig also provided uncredited rewrites (and was briefly attached as co-screenwriter) for the 2018 Transformers spin-off film, Bumblebee, which also starred Steinfeld.\n\n\n=== 2020s ===\nFremon Craig was originally attached as the sole screenwriter for an animated film adaptation of Scooby-Doo for Warner Animation Group. The film, released as Scoob! in 2020, was instead rewritten by Adam Sztykiel, Jack Donaldson, Derek Elliott, Matt Lieberman, Eyal Podell, and Jonathon E. Stewart. Fremon Craig collaborated again with James L. Brooks in the film adaptation of the Judy Blume book Are You There God?

She also takes inspiration from Nora Ephron by taking moments of her own life and putting them into her writing\nJohn Wilden Hughes Jr. (February 18, 1950 – August 6, 2009) was an American film director, producer and screenwriter. He began his career in 1970 as an author of humorous essays and stories for the National Lampoon magazine. He went on in Hollywood to write, produce and direct some of the most successful live-action-comedy films of the 1980s and 1990s. He directed such films as Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, Weird Science, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Planes, Trains and Automobiles, She's Having a Baby, and Uncle Buck; and wrote the films National Lampoon's Vacation, Mr. Mom, Pretty in Pink, The Great Outdoors, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, Home Alone, Dutch, and Beethoven.\nMost of Hughes' works were set in Chicago at the fictional Shermer High School and were coming-of-age teen comedy films. Many of his most enduring characters from these years were written for Molly Ringwald. While out on a walk one morning in New York City in the summer of 2009, Hughes suffered a fatal heart attack. His legacy after his death was honored by many, including at the 82nd Academy Awards by many actors he had worked with such as Ringwald, Matthew Broderick, Anthony Michael Hall, Chevy Chase, and Macaulay Culkin among others. Actors whose careers Hughes helped launch include Michael Keaton, Hall, Bill Paxton, Broderick, Culkin, and members of the Brat Pack group.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHughes was born on February 18, 1950, in Lansing, Michigan, to Marion Crawford, who volunteered in charity work, and John Hughes Sr., who worked in sales. He was the only boy, and had three sisters. He spent the first twelve years of his life in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, where he was a fan of Detroit Red Wings right winger Gordie Howe. One of Howe's #9 jerseys, sent by Howe himself, was later prominently featured in Hughes's 1986 film Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Hughes described himself as \"kind of quiet\":\n\nI grew up in a neighborhood that was mostly girls and old people. There weren't any boys my age, so I spent a lot of time by myself, imagining things. And every time we would get established somewhere, we would move. Life just started to get good in seventh grade, and then we moved to Chicago. I ended up in a really big high school, and I didn't know anybody. But then The Beatles came along and changed my whole life. And then Bob Dylan's Bringing It All Back Home came out and really changed me. Thursday I was one person, and Friday I was another. My heroes were Dylan, John Lennon and Picasso, because they each moved their particular medium forward, and when they got to the point where they were comfortable, they always moved on.\n\nIn 1963, Hughes's family moved to Northbrook, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. There, his father found work selling roofing materials. Hughes attended Grove Middle School, later going on to Glenbrook North High School, which gave him inspiration for the films that eventually made his reputation. He met Nancy Ludwig, a cheerleader and his future wife, in high school. As a teenager, Hughes turned to movies as an escape. According to childhood friend Jackson Peterson, \"His mom and dad criticized him a lot (...) She [Marion] would be critical of what John would want to do\". Hughes was a fan of the Beatles, and allegedly knew a lot about movies and the Rat Pack.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 1970–1981: Rise to prominence ===\nAfter dropping out of the University of Arizona, Hughes began selling jokes to well-established performers such as Rodney Dangerfield and Joan Rivers. Hughes used his jokes to get an entry-level job at Needham, Harper & Steers as an advertising copywriter in Chicago in 1970 and later in 1974 at Leo Burnett Worldwide. During this period, he created what became the famous Edge \"Credit Card Shaving Test\" ad campaign.\nHughes's work on the Virginia Slims account frequently took him to the Philip Morris headquarters in New York City, which allowed him to visit the offices of National Lampoon magazine. Soon thereafter, \nNesta Marlee Cooper (born December 11, 1993) is a Canadian actress best known for her roles of Dani Barnes in Reality High and Shannon in The Edge of Seventeen.

He is of Korean descent. Prior to his breakout role on Growing Up Fisher, he competed on South Korea's MBC's Star Audition. Lim has portrayed recurring roles on various television series such as Fresh Off The Boat, Speechless and Splitting Up Together. In 2018, Netflix released their original animated feature Duck Duck Goose, in which Lim voiced Chao. In 2019, he was cast in the pilot The Edge of Seventeen and in the Netflix's feature Hubie Halloween.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLance Lim at IMDb\nIn genre studies, a coming-of-age story is a genre of literature, theatre, film, and video game that focuses on the growth of a protagonist from childhood to adulthood, or \"coming of age\". Coming-of-age stories tend to emphasize dialogue or internal monologue over action and are often set in the past. The subjects of coming-of-age stories are typically teenagers. The Bildungsroman is a specific subgenre of coming-of-age story.\nThe plot points of coming-of-age stories are usually emotional changes within the character(s) in question.\n\n\n== Bildungsroman ==\n\nIn literary criticism, coming-of-age novels and Bildungsroman are sometimes interchangeable, but the former is usually a wider genre. The Bildungsroman (from the German words Bildung, \"education\", alternatively \"forming\" and Roman, \"novel\") is further characterized by a number of formal, topical, and thematic features. It focuses on the psychological and moral growth of the protagonist from childhood to adulthood (coming of age), in which character change is important.\nThe genre evolved from folk tales of young children exploring the world to find their fortune. Although the Bildungsroman arose in Germany, it has had extensive influence first in Europe and later throughout the world. Thomas Carlyle had translated Goethe's Wilhelm Meister novels into English, and after their publication in 1824/1825, many British authors wrote novels inspired by it.\nMany variations of the Bildungsroman exist, such as the Künstlerroman (\"artist novel\"), which focuses on the self-growth of an artist.\n\n\n== Teen films ==\nIn film, coming-of-age is a genre of teen films. Coming-of-age films focus on the psychological and moral growth or transition of a protagonist from youth to adulthood. A variant in the 2020s is the \"delayed-coming-of-age film, a kind of story that acknowledges the deferred nature of 21st-century adulthood\", in which young adults may still be exploring short-term relationships, living situations, and jobs even into their late 20s and early 30s.\nPersonal growth and change is an important characteristic of the genre, which relies on dialogue and emotional responses, rather than action. The story is sometimes told in the form of a flashback. Historically, coming-of-age films usually centred on young boys, although coming-of-age films focusing on girls have become more common in the early 21st century, such as The Poker House (2008), Winter's Bone (2010), Hick (2011), Girlhood (2014), Mustang (2015), Inside Out (2015), The Diary of a Teenage Girl (2015), Mistress America (2015), The Edge of Seventeen (2016), Lady Bird (2017), Sweet 20 (2017), Aftersun (2022) and Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret. (2023).\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of coming-of-age stories\n\n\n== References ==\nSurvivor is the third studio album by American girl group Destiny's Child. It was released on April 25, 2001, by Columbia Records. As their breakthrough second studio album The Writing's on the Wall (1999) became a rising commercial success, Destiny's Child faced the controversial departure of original members LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson, who were replaced with Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams, in February 2000. Soon afterwards, they commenced production of their third studio album, tentatively titled Independent Women.\nMere five months after joining, Franklin departed from the group in July, and \"Independent Women Part I\" was subsequently released as a single from the accompanying soundtrack for the film Charlie's Angels (2000). The song became a global commercial success and the group's third US Billboard Hot 100 number-one single. Retitling the album Survivor in reference to the turmoil surrounding their line-up alterations, Destiny's Child enlisted producers such as Anthony Dent, Damon Elliott, Mark J. Feist, Rob Fusari and Keybeats alongside Beyoncé Knowles, who produced all and co-wrote nearly all of the album's tracks. Their final product was an R&B and pop record incorporating genres such as dance, funk and hip hop. Its lyrical themes explore dynamics between women, self-esteem, independence and romantic relationships.\nUpon its release, Survivor received generally positive reviews, mostly aimed at its production, while its balladry, length and lyrical content ignited criticism. Retrospective critical commentaries have credited the record for its impact on mainstream music of the 2000s and for serving as foundation for Knowles' eventual solo career. A global commercial success, the album debuted atop the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 663,000 units, becoming Destiny's Child's first and only number-one studio album on the chart. It has gone on to be certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). At the 44th Annual Grammy Awards (2002), the album was nominated for Best R&B Album. By the end of 2001, it had sold over three million copies worldwide, being among the best-selling girl group albums of all time.\nSurvivor produced four singles. Its title track peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 and reached the top ten in 18 additional countries. In 2002, it won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. \"Bootylicious\" became Destiny's Child's fourth US Billboard Hot 100 number-one single and attained international success. \"Emotion\" became a US Billboard Hot 100 top-ten hit in the wake of the September 11 attacks, while \"Nasty Girl\" was released only overseas and achieved moderate success. The album was further promoted with the co-headlining Total Request Live Tour (2001) and the Destiny's Child World Tour (2002). After the latter's conclusion, the group embarked on a two-year hiatus, during which each member released a solo studio album to varying levels of success.\n\n\n== Background and development ==\nIn July 1999, Destiny's Child released their second studio album The Writing's on the Wall. Their breakthrough record, it debuted at number six on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 133,000 units. In December, LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson tried to split with Destiny's Child's manager Mathew Knowles, claiming that he was keeping too much of the group's profits and that he favored his daughter Beyoncé Knowles and Kelly Rowland. When the accompanying music video for \"Say My Name\" premiered in February 2000, Roberson and Luckett found out that they were being replaced with Michelle Williams, a former backing vocalist for Monica, and Farrah Franklin, an aspiring singer-actress. On March 15, Roberson and Luckett filed a lawsuit against Mathew Knowles and their former bandmates for breach of partnership and fiduciary duties. Following the lawsuit, both sides were disparaging towards each other in the media.

Founded in March 2014 by film producer Robert Simonds, the studio produces film, television, and digital media projects.\nIn April 2020, STX announced that it would merge with the Indian studio Eros International plc. The merger was completed in July 2020, and STX became a division of ErosSTX. In December 2021, Jahm Najafi announced his intention to acquire STX from the merged company for $173 million–a sale completed in April 2022. Eros remains a minority, non-voting shareholder.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2012, Simonds and McGlashan began work on conceptualizing a media company based on the idea of producing medium-budget projects with a star attached, a method that had gone out of style with Hollywood studios. The conversation led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014, with the mission to finance, develop, produce, market, and distribute star-driven content around the world. Investors in the company included Hony Capital, Tencent, PCCW, TPG Growth, RTL Group and Liberty Global. Individual investors include Gigi Pritzker, Beau Wrigley, and Dominic Ng.\nIn September 2017, it was reported that STX was considering an initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (SEHK). It was reported that a listing on the SEHK could bring STX closer to Chinese investors and audiences. The Wall Street Journal stated that the company could be valued at $3.5 billion, after raising an additional $500 million following the IPO. In April 2018, the company filed for an IPO on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.\nSTX called off its IPO in October 2018, citing the China–U.S. trade war, and conditions having deteriorated in Hong Kong due to turbulence in the mainland Chinese equity market.  An overall co-funding agreement with Chinese company Huayi Brothers Media lapsed at the end of 2018, and in April 2019, co-founder Bill McGlashan was fired due to his being indicted in the college admissions bribery scandal.\nIn April 2020, STX announced that it would merge with the Indian film and television studio Eros International plc. Simonds stated that the merger would create \"the first independent media company with the expertise and creative cultures of Hollywood and Bollywood, while also leveraging the important inroads both companies have made into the Chinese market.\" The combined company would be publicly traded, inheriting Eros' listing on the New York Stock Exchange. The merger was closed on July 30, 2020; the combined company unveiled a new logo and branding as ErosSTX in September. The combined entity raised $125 million of new equity funding and received $350 million in credit led by JPMorgan.\nIn December 2021, amid financial shortcomings following the merger, Jahm Najafi's Najafi Companies announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire STX Entertainment from ErosSTX for $173 million. However, in late January 2022, Lionsgate also emerged as a potential suitor, looking to absorb either part or whole of STX, but the deal was later rejected, leaving only Najafi as a potential suitor. In April 2022, Najafi Companies completed its acquisition of STX Entertainment. Eros Media World will retain a 15% non-voting stake in the company. In July 2022, shortly after STX's motion picture chairman Adam Fogelson departed for the studio, Deadline reported that STX was in talks with Lionsgate over a potential film distribution deal. Shortly after, it was reported that STX Entertainment's U.K. offices, including the London office housing STXinternational's headquarters, were gradually shutting down. Following the departure of STXinternational head John Friedberg to join Black Bear Pictures' international division, it was announced the latter company was nearing a deal with STX to handle part of its slate internationally. In November 2022, It was reported that STX's distribution and marketing operations would be shuttered and that Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre would go to a streaming\nLea DeLaria (born May 23, 1958) is an American comedian, actress, and jazz singer.

The Bildungsroman (from the German words Bildung, \"education\", alternatively \"forming\" and Roman, \"novel\") is further characterized by a number of formal, topical, and thematic features. It focuses on the psychological and moral growth of the protagonist from childhood to adulthood (coming of age), in which character change is important.\nThe genre evolved from folk tales of young children exploring the world to find their fortune. Although the Bildungsroman arose in Germany, it has had extensive influence first in Europe and later throughout the world. Thomas Carlyle had translated Goethe's Wilhelm Meister novels into English, and after their publication in 1824/1825, many British authors wrote novels inspired by it.\nMany variations of the Bildungsroman exist, such as the Künstlerroman (\"artist novel\"), which focuses on the self-growth of an artist."
