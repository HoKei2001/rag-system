        "content": "Warner Records Inc. (known as Warner Bros. Records Inc. until 2019) is an American record label.  A subsidiary of the Warner Music Group, it is headquartered in Los Angeles, California. It was founded on March 19, 1958, as the recorded music division of the American film studio Warner Bros.\nArtists who have recorded for Warner Records include  Madonna, Prince, Linkin Park, Zach Bryan, Van Halen, Kylie Minogue, ZZ Top, Gorillaz, Bette Midler, Grateful Dead, Jane's Addiction, Duran Duran, Fleetwood Mac, Rod Stewart, Funkadelic, James Taylor,  Red Hot Chili Peppers, Mac Miller, R.E.M., Bob James, David Sanborn, and the Sex Pistols.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\nAt the end of the silent movie period, Warner Bros. Pictures decided to expand into publishing and recording so that it could access low-cost music content for its films. In 1928, the studio acquired several smaller music publishing firms which included M. Witmark & Sons, Harms Inc., and a partial interest in New World Music Corp., and merged them to form the Music Publishers Holding Company. This new group controlled valuable copyrights on standards by George and Ira Gershwin and Jerome Kern, and the new division was soon earning solid profits of up to US$2 million every year.\nIn 1930, Music Publishers Holding Company (MPHC) paid US$28 million to acquire Brunswick Records (which included Vocalion), whose roster included Duke Ellington, Red Nichols, Nick Lucas, Al Jolson, Earl Burtnett, Ethel Waters, Abe Lyman, Leroy Carr, Tampa Red and Memphis Minnie, and soon after the sale to Warner Bros., the label signed rising radio and recording stars Bing Crosby, Mills Brothers, and Boswell Sisters. Unfortunately for Warner Bros., the dual impact of the Great Depression and the introduction of broadcast radio greatly harmed the recording industry—sales crashed, dropping by around 90% from more than 100 million records in 1927 to fewer than 10 million by 1932 and major companies were forced to halve the price of records from 75 to 35 cents.\nIn December 1931, Warner Bros. offloaded Brunswick to the American Record Corporation (ARC) for a fraction of its former value, in a lease arrangement which did not include Brunswick's pressing plants. Technically, Warner maintained actual ownership of Brunswick, which with the sale of ARC to CBS in 1939 and their decision to discontinue Brunswick in favor of reviving the Columbia label, reverted to Warner Bros. Warner Bros. sold Brunswick a second time (along with Brunswick's back catalog up to 1931) in 1941, this time along with the old Brunswick pressing plants Warner owned, to Decca Records (which formed its American operations in 1934) in exchange for a financial interest in Decca. The heavy loss it incurred in the Brunswick deal kept the studio out of the record business for almost 20 years, and during this period it licensed its film music to other companies for release as soundtrack albums.\n\n\n=== 1958–1963: formation and early years ===\n  \nWarner Bros. returned to the record business on March 19, 1958, with the establishment of its own recording division, Warner Bros. Records. By this time, the established Hollywood studios were reeling from multiple challenges to their former dominance—the most notable being the introduction of television in the late 1940s. Legal changes also had a major impact on their business—lawsuits brought by major stars had effectively overthrown the old studio contract system by the late 1940s and, beginning in 1949, anti-trust suits brought by the U.S. government forced the five major studios to divest their cinema chains.\nIn 1956, Harry Warner and Albert Warner sold their interest in the studio and the board was joined by new members who favored a renewed expansion into the music business—Charles Allen of the investment bank Charles Allen & Company, Serge Semenenko of the First National Bank of Boston and investor David Baird. Semenenko in particular had a strong professional interest in the entertainment \nWarner Music Group Corp., commonly abbreviated as WMG, is an American multinational entertainment and record label conglomerate headquartered in New York City. It is one of the \"big three\" recording companies and the third-largest in the global music industry, after Universal Music Group (UMG) and Sony Music Entertainment (SME). Formerly part of Time Warner (later known as WarnerMedia, now Warner Bros. Discovery), WMG was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange from 2005 until 2011, when it announced its privatization and sale to Access Industries. It later had its second IPO on Nasdaq in 2020, once again becoming a public company. With a multibillion-dollar annual turnover, WMG employs more than 4,500 people and has operations in more than 50 countries throughout the world.\nThe company owns and operates some of the largest and most successful labels in the world, including Elektra Records, Reprise Records, Warner Records, Parlophone Records (previously owned by EMI), and Atlantic Records. WMG also owns Warner Chappell Music, one of the world's largest music publishers.\nSince August 2, 2018, WMG has expanded its business to digital media operations through its acquisition of Uproxx.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1950s and 1960s ===\nThe film studio Warner Bros. had no record label division at the time one of its contracted actors, Tab Hunter, scored a No. 1 hit song in 1957 for Dot Records, a division of rival Paramount Pictures. In order to prevent any repetition of its actors recording for rival companies, and to also capitalize on the music business, Warner Bros. Records was created in 1958; its original office was located above the film studio's machine shop on 3701 Warner Boulevard in Burbank, California. In 1963, Warner purchased Reprise Records, which had been founded by Frank Sinatra three years earlier so that he could have more creative control over his recordings. With the Reprise acquisition, Warner gained the services of Mo Ostin, who was mainly responsible for the success of Warner/Reprise.\nAfter Warner Bros. was sold to Seven Arts Productions in 1967 (forming Warner Bros.-Seven Arts), it purchased Atlantic Records, founded in 1947 and WMG's oldest label (until WMG completed its acquisition of Parlophone in 2013), as well as its subsidiary Atco Records. This acquisition brought Neil Young into the company fold, initially as a member of Buffalo Springfield. Young became one of Warner's longest-established artists, recording both as a solo artist and with groups under the Warner-owned Atlantic, Atco, and Reprise labels. Young also recorded five albums for Geffen Records during that label's period of Warner distribution. The Geffen catalogue, now owned by Universal Music Group, represents Young's only major recordings not under WMG ownership.\nAtlantic, its subsidiary Atco Records, and its affiliate Stax Records paved the way for Warner's rise to industry prominence. The purchase brought in Atlantic's lucrative back catalogue, which included classic recordings by Ray Charles, the Drifters, the Coasters, and many more. In the mid-1960s, Atlantic/Stax released a string of landmark soul music recordings by artists including Booker T & the MGs, Sam & Dave, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, Ben E. King, and Aretha Franklin. Ultimately, the sale led to Stax leaving Atlantic because Seven Arts Productions insisted on keeping the rights to Stax recordings. Atlantic moved decisively into rock and pop in the late 1960s and 1970s, signing major British and American acts including Led Zeppelin, Cream, Crosby Stills & Nash, Yes, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Genesis, Average White Band, Dr. John, King Crimson, Bette Midler, Roxy Music, and Foreigner.\nIn 1969, two years after being purchased by Seven Arts, the Warner Bros.-Seven Arts company was sold to the Kinney National Company. In mid-1972, Kinney Music of Canada, Ltd. was renamed WEA Music of Canada, Ltd. (French: WEA Musique du Canada, Ltée) as the Canadian branch of the WEA (Warner, El\nWarner Music Group (WMG) owns, has a joint share, or is associated with the record labels listed here.\n\n\n== Flagship labels ==\nAtlantic Records\nElektra Records\nParlophone Records\nWarner Records\n\n\n== Atlantic Music Group ==\n\n\n== 300 Elektra Entertainment ==\n\n300 Entertainment\nElektra Records\nAsylum Records (back catalog)\nEastWest Records America (back catalog)\nBlack Cement\nDCD2 Records\nDTA Records\nFueled by Ramen\nLow Country Sound\nRoadrunner Records\nPublic Consumption Recording Co.\n\n\n== Warner Records ==\n\n\n== Parlophone Label Group ==\n\nParlophone Records, including reissues from the back catalogs of:\nChrysalis Records (UK, part)\nEMI Columbia Records\nEMI Records (UK)\nHarvest Records (UK)\nRegal Recordings\nFFRR Records\nKling Klang Produkt\nMarv Music (joint-venture with film production company Marv Studios)\nPink Floyd Records (British and European distribution only)\nStateside Records (British distribution only)\nTop Rank Records\n\n\n== Rhino Entertainment ==\n\nAtco Records\nBearsville Records\nDel-Fi Records\nEleven: A Music Company\nJubilee Records\nRhino Records\nRoulette Records\nTK Records\nRhino handles the American distribution of reissues from the UK back catalogs of Chrysalis (part), EMI Columbia, EMI, Harvest, and Parlophone.\n\n\n== Alternative Distribution Alliance ==\n\n\n== Arts Music ==\nSesame Street Records\nFirst Night Records\nMattel Music\nSh-K-Boom Records\n\n\n== Warner Classics ==\n\nWarner Classics Records (incorporating EMI Classics and Angel Records)\nErato Records (incorporating Virgin Classics)\nTeldec Records\nElektra Nonesuch Records\nFinlandia Records\nLontano Records\nWarner Apex\nWarner Elatus\nWarner Fonit Records\nNVC Arts Records\n\n\n== Warner Music Nashville ==\nAtlantic Records Nashville\nWarner Records Nashville\nElektra Records Nashville\nMarcus Music\n\n\n== International labels ==\n\n\n=== Warner Music International ===\nWarner Music International (formerly WEA International) is the international copyright holder and distributor for North American artists on the Warner Music record labels.

It is owned by Warner Music Group, and operates through Warner Records, one of its flagship labels.\nArtists currently signed to Reprise Records include Green Day, Enya, Michael Bublé, Eric Clapton, Stevie Nicks, Neil Young, Deftones, Mastodon, Lindsey Buckingham, Josh Groban, Disturbed, Idina Menzel, My Chemical Romance, Gerard Way, Dwight Yoakam, Never Shout Never, and Billy Strings.\n\n\n== Company history ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings ===\n\nReprise Records was formed in 1960 by Frank Sinatra in order to allow more artistic freedom for his own recordings. Soon thereafter, he garnered the nickname \"The Chairman of the Board\". Because of dissatisfaction with Capitol Records, and after trying to buy Norman Granz's Verve Records, the first album Sinatra released on Reprise was Ring-a-Ding-Ding! As CEO of Reprise, Sinatra recruited several artists for the fledgling label, such as fellow Rat Pack members Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. The original roster from 1961 to 1963 included Bing Crosby, Jo Stafford, Rosemary Clooney, Duke Ellington, Nancy Sinatra, Esquivel and stand-up comedian Redd Foxx. The original Reprise LP label had four different logos, depending on the genre: a riverboat for Pop records (pictured), a cherub for Jazz records, an owl for Spoken Word/Comedy records, and a picture of Sinatra for his records.\n\nOne of the label's founding principles under Sinatra's leadership was that each artist would have full creative freedom, and at some point complete ownership of their work, including publishing rights. This is the reason why recordings of early Reprise artists (Dean Martin, Jimi Hendrix, the Kinks, etc.) are (in most cases) currently distributed through other labels. In Martin's case, his Reprise recordings were out of print for nearly 20 years before a deal was struck with Capitol Records. Reprise continued to reissue the Sinatra catalog until 2013 when it was sold to Capitol.\n\n\n=== Sale to Warner Bros. ===\nIn August 1963, as part of a film deal, Warner Bros. purchased Reprise (which had been losing money) from Frank Sinatra, who nonetheless retained a 1/3 interest in the label. Many of the older artists on the label were dropped by Warner Bros. Records. Reprise president Mo Ostin was retained as the head of the label and he went on to play a very significant role in the history of the Warner group of labels over the next four decades. Warner-Reprise executives began targeting younger acts, beginning by securing the American distribution rights to the Pye Records recordings by the Kinks in 1964. Reprise soon added teen-oriented pop acts like Dino, Desi & Billy to the roster. As well, Sinatra's own daughter Nancy (who began recording for the label in 1961) was retained by Ostin, becoming a major pop star from late 1965. The label moved almost exclusively to rock-oriented music in the late 1960s, although Frank Sinatra continued to record for the label until the 1980s.\nThrough direct signings or distribution deals, by the 1970s the Reprise roster grew to include Lee Hazlewood, Jill Jackson, Jimi Hendrix, the early Joni Mitchell recordings, Neil Young, the Electric Prunes, Donna Loren, Arlo Guthrie, Norman Greenbaum, Tom Lehrer, Kenny Rogers and The First Edition, Tiny Tim, Ry Cooder, Captain Beefheart, John Sebastian, Family, the early 1970s recordings by Frank Zappa and the Mothers, Gram Parsons, Emmylou Harris, Nico's Desertshore, the Fugs, Jethro Tull, Pentangle, T. Rex, the Meters, John Cale, Gordon Lightfoot, Michael Franks, Richard Pryor, Al Jarreau, Fleetwood Mac, Fanny, and the Beach Boys.\n\n\n=== Dormancy ===\n\nIn 1976, the Reprise label was deactivated by Warner Bros. and all of its roster (except Frank Sinatra and Neil Young) was moved to the main Warner Bros. label. Although older catalog albums continued to be manufactured with the Reprise logo, and albums by the Beach Boys on Brother Records were issued in the Reprise catalog numbering seque\nGiant Records was launched in 1990 as a joint venture between Warner Bros. Records and record executive Irving Azoff. Currently, this name is used as a Swedish label owned by Warner Music Sweden, a Swedish branch of Warner Music Group.\nIn 1990, Giant became a subsidiary label for Warner Music Group. Its first release, in early 1991, was the Gulf War all-star tribute song \"Voices That Care,\" assembled by producer David Foster. That spring, \"Hold You Tight\" by Tara Kemp was released and went on to become a Top 5 single. In the months that followed, Giant Records released the soundtrack album for the film New Jack City, selling 16 million copies worldwide. The label signed such acts as MC Hammer, Jade, Lord Finesse, and teen pop star Jeremy Jordan. Giant also signed established acts such as Steely Dan, Warren Zevon, Oingo Boingo, Chicago, Deep Purple, Morbid Angel, Brian Wilson, and Kenny Rogers. The label also operated a country music division in Nashville; the first act signed was Dennis Robbins.\nIn 1992, Irving Azoff expanded the Giant brand into film production. Giant Pictures only produced one film, The Inkwell, in 1994, before shutting down a year later.\nIn 1993, Giant became dissatisfied with Warner Music Group's practice of international affairs, so it made a deal with BMG to distribute its recordings outside the U.S. By the mid- to late 1990s, the company had replaced most of its staff and launched a subsidiary label called Revolution Records; Brian Wilson signed with the new label in 1997.\nThe company later reverted to its original name and distributed Paladin Records, which included singer-songwriter Steve Forbert. In 2001, Warner Music Group ended its joint venture with Giant, which was absorbed into Warner Bros. Records. Since then, BMG no longer repressed and distributed any previous releases of Giant. Distribution of current reissues are done by Warner Music's reissue division, Rhino, in conjunction with Warner Records, and many reissues still include Giant logo on packaging.\nIn February 2015, Warner Music Sweden announced that it would reactivate Giant's name; the first single released under the new Giant Records banner was Simon Erics' \"Waiting for the Sun.\"\nOn June 9, 2022, Azoff relaunched a rebranded and independent version of the label with no connections to Warner called Giant Music.  \n\n\n== Giant Records recording artists ==\nArtists on Giant Records were primarily distributed by Warner Bros.

Its early releases, in 1968, were distributed in the US by London Records. From the beginning, Sire introduced underground, progressive British bands to the American market. Early releases included the Climax Blues Band, Barclay James Harvest, Tomorrow, Matthews Southern Comfort and proto-punks The Deviants. \nWhen distribution by London ended after two years, US distribution was handled by various companies: Polydor Records in 1970 and 1971, during which time Sire's famous logo was introduced; by Famous Music from 1972 to 1974, during which time the progressive rock band Focus charted with their 1972 hit \"Hocus Pocus\"; and by ABC Records, which inherited Sire's distribution deal when it acquired Famous Music. Sire was distributed by Phonogram Inc. in Europe from 1974 to 1977. \nIn the 70s, Sire released a number of compilation albums, including the 3 volume \"History Of British Rock\" series, and acts such as The Flamin Groovies, Renaissance, The Turtles, Duane Eddy, the Small Faces, and Del Shannon. Sire had one of its biggest successes when Climax Blues Band reached number 3 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1977 with \"Couldn't Get It Right\". Also in 1977, Stein, who had previously worked with the Shangri-Las in the 1960s, convinced the group to reform and return to the studio. But the trio working together again proved to be short-lived and they asked to be let out of their contract; the new songs they had recorded were not released by the label.\n\n\n=== Acquisition by Warner ===\nIn the mid-1970s, Sire transformed itself into a successful independent record label and went on to sign artists from the burgeoning punk rock and new wave scenes, including the Ramones, the Dead Boys, the Undertones, and Talking Heads. Sire returned to major label distribution in 1977 with a new deal with Warner Bros. Records. The following year Warner Bros. and Sire entered negotiations whereby Warner Bros. would purchase Sire Records outright, making Sire one of Warner Bros. subsidiary labels.  Over the next several years, Sire saw success in the US and Canada with acts such as the Pretenders, Madonna (their biggest act), Soft Cell, the Cure, Depeche Mode, The Smiths, Martini Ranch and Echo & the Bunnymen. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the label had continued success with a roster that included Ministry, k.d. lang, Ice-T, Seal, and Tommy Page.\nIn 1994, Sire switched distribution from Warner Bros. Records to sister label Elektra Records, also part of parent company Warner Music Group (WMG). Stein had been appointed president of Elektra Records under Elektra's newly appointed CEO Sylvia Rhone, so Stein would also be overseeing distribution of Sire releases by Elektra as well as running Elektra day-to-day. Sire left Elektra distribution in 1997 as it became a stand-alone label. But in 2000, Sire and the US division of London Records were merged to become one label, London-Sire Records. This partnership, however, was dissolved in April 2003, at which point the company went back to being called Sire Records, and it returned to distribution with Warner Bros. Records once again.\nIn 1998, Sire signed a deal with the band The Tragically Hip to distribute their music outside of Canada.\nIn 2009, official music videos displayed on the Sire Records website were taken down because of a copyright claim by parent Warner Music Group, after royalty negotiations between WMG and YouTube (which Sire had been using to host the videos) broke down in December 2008. In September 2009, both parties came to terms, with Warner Music restoring its music onto YouTube.\nIn July 2017, Rani Hancock was named the new president of Sire Records.

Except for a new single by Cher, \"A Woman's Story\", and a Dion album, Born to Be with You, which was released only in the United Kingdom, all the releases on Warner-Spector were reissues of product from Philles Records, the label Phil Spector had co-founded in 1962.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of record labels\n\n\n== References ==\nGrand Upright Music, Ltd v. Warner Bros. Records Inc., 780 F. Supp. 182 (S.D.N.Y. 1991), was a copyright case heard by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Songwriter Gilbert O'Sullivan sued rapper Biz Markie after Markie sampled O'Sullivan's song \"Alone Again (Naturally)\". The court ruled that sampling without permission constitutes copyright infringement. The judgment changed the hip hop music industry, requiring that any future music sampling be approved by the original copyright owners.\n\n\n== Case ==\nRapper Biz Markie had sampled a portion of the song \"Alone Again (Naturally)\" by singer-songwriter Gilbert O'Sullivan in the track \"Alone Again\" from Markie's third album, I Need a Haircut. Markie and his production and recording companies were listed as co-defendants with Warner Bros. in the subsequent lawsuit.\nJudge Kevin Thomas Duffy granted an injunction against the defendant, Warner Bros. Records, despite Warner Bros.' claim that Grand Upright did not own a valid copyright in the sampled song.  Warner Bros. denied that Grand Upright owned the copyright to the song, though Grand Upright produced documentation that O'Sullivan had transferred title to them, and O'Sullivan himself testified to that regard.  It also appears that the defendants unsuccessfully urged the court to take note of how common unapproved sampling was in the industry, because the court noted that \"the defendants...would have this court believe that stealing is rampant in the music business and, for that reason, their conduct here should be excused.\"\nThe decision received some criticism for stating that \"the most persuasive evidence that the copyrights are valid and owned by the plaintiff\" was that Warner Bros. had previously attempted to obtain permission to use the song.  However, this would not legally establish that Grand Upright was in fact the owner, but only that Warner Bros. believed that the song was copyrighted by someone, which would make their infringement knowing and willful.  As Grand Upright had provided evidence that specifically established the copyright was theirs, the ruling did not hinge on this point, however.\nThe court wrote that \"it is clear that the defendants knew that they were violating the plaintiff's rights as well as the rights of others. Their only aim was to sell thousands upon thousands of records.  This callous disregard for the law and for the rights of others requires not only the preliminary injunction sought by the plaintiff but also sterner measures.\"  The judge referred the matter to a United States Attorney for criminal prosecution, though no criminal charges were filed.\nJudge Duffy has been accused of bias in admonishing the defense and referring the defense for criminal prosecution. Such criticism points out that Duffy's written opinion begins with one of the biblical ten commandments, \"Thou shalt not steal.\" According to The Copyright Infringement Project of UCLA Law and Columbia Law School, Judge Duffy's opinion in Grand Upright v. Warner demonstrates \"an iffy understanding on the part of this judge of the facts and issues before him in this case.\"\n\n\n== Impact on music ==\nThe court case had a major effect on hip hop music. Sample clearance fees prohibited the use of more than one or two samples for most recordings, with some mechanical rights holders demanding up to 100% of royalties. As each sample had to be cleared to avoid legal action, records such as those produced by the Bomb Squad for Public Enemy, which use dozens of samples, became prohibitively expensive to produce. According to Pitchfork, \"Overnight it became forbiddingly difficult and expensive to incorporate even a handful of samples into a new beat ... Producers scaled back their creations, often augmenting one choice groove with a bevy of instrumental embellishments.\"\nAs a result, interpolation (replaying the requested sample using new instrumentalists, using the newly recorded version and simply paying the songw\nWarner Sunset Records was an American record label established in 1996 by Warner Music Group to release soundtrack albums of Warner Bros. films.

Studios complex in Burbank, California, and a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). Founded in 1923 by four brothers, Harry, Albert, Sam, and Jack Warner, the company established itself as a leader in the American film industry before diversifying into animation, television, and video games, and is one of the \"Big Five\" major American film studios, as well as a member of the Motion Picture Association (MPA).\nThe company is known for its film studio division, the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, which includes Warner Bros. Pictures, New Line Cinema, Warner Bros. Pictures Animation, Castle Rock Entertainment, DC Studios, and the Warner Bros. Television Group. Bugs Bunny, a character created for the Looney Tunes series, is the company's official mascot.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\nThe company's name originated from the founding Warner brothers (born Wonsal, Woron, and Wonskolaser before Anglicization): Harry, Albert, Sam, and Jack Warner. Harry, Albert and Sam emigrated as young children with their Polish-Jewish mother to the United States from Krasnosielc, Poland (then part of Congress Poland within the Russian Empire), in October 1889, a year after their father emigrated to the U.S. and settled in Baltimore, Maryland. As in many other immigrant families, the elder Wonsal children gradually acquired anglicized versions of their Yiddish-sounding names: Szmuel Wonsal became Samuel Warner (nicknamed \"Sam\"), Hirsz Wonsal became Harry Warner, and Aaron Wonsal (although born with a given name common in the Americas) became Albert Warner. Jack, the youngest brother, was born in London, Ontario, during the family's two-year residency in Canada.\n\nThe three elder brothers began in the movie theater business, having acquired a movie projector with which they showed films in the mining towns of Pennsylvania and Ohio. In the beginning, Sam and Albert Warner invested $150 to present Life of an American Fireman and The Great Train Robbery. They opened their first theater, the Cascade, in New Castle, Pennsylvania, in 1903. When the original building was in danger of being demolished, the modern Warner Bros. called the current building owners and arranged to save it. The owners noted people across the country had asked them to protect it for its historical significance.\nIn 1904, the Warners founded the Pittsburgh-based Duquesne Amusement & Supply Company, to distribute films. In 1912, Harry Warner hired an auditor named Paul Ashley Chase. By the time of World War I, they had begun producing films; in the early 1920s they acquired their first studio facilities on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. Sam and Jack produced the pictures, while Harry and Albert, along with their auditor and now-controller Chase, handled finance and distribution in New York City. During World War I their first nationally syndicated film, My Four Years in Germany, based on a popular book by former ambassador James W. Gerard, was released. On April 4, 1923, with help from money loaned to Harry by his banker Motley Flint, they formally incorporated as Warner Bros. Pictures, Incorporated. (As late as the 1960s, Warner Bros. claimed 1905 as its founding date.)\n\nThe first important deal was the acquisition of the rights to Avery Hopwood's 1919 Broadway play, The Gold Diggers, from theatrical impresario David Belasco. However, Rin Tin Tin, a dog brought from France after World War I by an American soldier, established their reputation. Rin Tin Tin's third film was the feature Where the North Begins, which was so successful that Jack signed the dog to star in more films for $1,000 per week. Rin Tin Tin became the studio's top star. Jack nicknamed him \"The Mortgage Lifter\" and the success boosted Darryl F. Zanuck's career. Zanuck eventually became a top producer and between 1928 and 1933 served a\nMax Lousada is CEO of Recorded Music for Warner Music Group.

Before moving over to Warner Music UK in 2013, Lousada was successively head of A&R, managing director, president, then chairman of Atlantic Records UK.\nOriginally from Tooting Bec, South London, England, Lousada became involved in the music industry in the 1990s with the emerging dance music scene in Brighton. He later founded his own independent imprint, Ultimate Dilemma, and became the head of Rawkus Records' operations outside North America. In 2002, he was appointed head of A&R at Mushroom Records UK, which was acquired by Warner Music Group and became part of Atlantic Records UK. He became the CEO of Recorded Music at Warner Music Group in 2017.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMax Lousada grew up in Tooting Bec, South London, England, and went to Elliott School in Putney. His mother was a photographer, and his father was a social worker and political activist. As a child, Lousada would spend his Saturdays selling newspapers of the Socialist Workers Party near Elephant and Castle. He later enrolled at University of Brighton but left after six months.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nLousada became involved in the emerging dance music scene in Brighton, frequenting places like the Jazz Rooms or The Zap, and organizing club nights. He later started his own distribution and management company, called In A Silent Way, with four of his friends. Named after a Miles Davis album, In A Silent Way was a fashion and music collective which imported and exported records for DJs and independent outlets. Through a network of labels and shops, Lousada imported and sold a variety of products ranging from French hip-hop vinyl records to Adidas trainers.\nLousada then worked for several small independent record labels and shops before forming his own independent imprint, Ultimate Dilemma. He was also appointed by Rawkus Records founders Brian Brater and Jarret Myer to lead the New York-based label's operations outside of North America. At Rawkus, Lousada was able to work with artists such as Mos Def and garner airplay for \"Ms. Fat Booty\" on BBC Radio 1. While operating independently, Rawkus Records was at the time funded by News International and partnered with Mushroom Records UK.\nMushroom Records UK also began funding Lousada's own label, Ultimate Dilemma, and he moved his operations from the Old Truman Brewery, where Rawkus Records UK was the first record label tenant, to Mushroom Records UK's studios in Fulham. In 2001, he signed ambient dance act Zero 7 and played a role in the development of their debut album Simple Things, which was nominated for the Mercury Prize. In February 2002, Lousada was appointed head A&R at Mushroom Records UK and its imprints Infectious, Perfecto and Ultimate Dilemma.\n\n\n=== Atlantic Records and Warner Music UK ===\nAfter its acquisition by Warner Music Group in 2003, Mushroom Records UK was absorbed into East West Records, and Lousada assumed the role of head of A&R at East West, which Warner Music turned into the UK operations of its Atlantic Records. Lousada was appointed managing director at Atlantic Records UK in 2004 where he achieved success with acts such as The Darkness, James Blunt and Funeral For a Friend, before being promoted to president, and then to chairman in 2009.\nLousada was named chairman and CEO of Warner Music UK in September 2013. In 2016, he oversaw the development of The Firepit, Warner Music UK's new recording studio located inside its London headquarters. In June 2016, Atlantic Records UK signed singer Rita Ora after her departure from Roc Nation. Lousada also led the successful promotion of Ed Sheeran's third album, ÷, in late 2017.

The CEO and co-chairman of Warner Records (formerly Warner Bros. Records), he was previously the president of A&R at Interscope Geffen A&M and the senior vice president of A&R at Atlantic Records.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBay-Schuck was born in Los Angeles to actors Susan Bay and John Schuck. His parents divorced when he was a child, and in 1989 his mother married actor Leonard Nimoy. His mother is a cousin of film director and producer Michael Bay.\nBay-Schuck attended Columbia University, where he majored in political science. He planned to attend law school and pursue a career in entertainment law. In his senior year, he met a video promotion executive from Capitol Records and had a conversation with her about how record companies operate. The next day he applied for an internship at Interscope Records. He was hired, and although he interned in the video promotion department, he became interested in A&R. He graduated from Columbia in 2003.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Atlantic Records, Interscope ===\nBay-Schuck returned to Los Angeles following his college graduation. Knowing that jobs at record companies had become scarce as the music industry constricted in the post-Napster era, he registered at an employment agency that placed temps at labels. He was assigned a short-term job at Interscope, and was quickly hired as a full-time assistant to Martin Kierszenbaum, then the head of international marketing for the label.  Determined to work in A&R, he left Interscope a year later to take a job as an A&R assistant at Atlantic.  In 2006, he was promoted to a staff A&R position.  His first hits in an A&R capacity were with the songs \"Shawty\" by Plies featuring T-Pain, and \"Right Round\" by Flo Rida featuring Kesha. Bay-Schuck co-wrote \"Right Round,\" which went five times platinum in the US and sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.\nOver the course of his ten years at Atlantic, Bay-Schuck worked with Cee Lo Green, B.o.B., T.I., Trey Songz, Travie McCoy, and Trick Daddy, among others. Most notably, he discovered, signed and developed Bruno Mars, who has since sold more than 170 million singles and 26 million albums worldwide. Following his success with Mars, Bay-Schuck, who had originally focused on rap and R&B, worked with artists of all genres. He was appointed senior vice president of A&R for Atlantic in 2012.\nIn 2014, Bay-Schuck was named president of A&R at Interscope Geffen A&M (IGA). At IGA he worked with artists including Gwen Stefani, Imagine Dragons, Lady Gaga, Skylar Grey, Maroon 5, OneRepublic, and Selena Gomez.\n\n\n=== Warner Records ===\nIn October 2017, it was announced that Bay-Schuck had been appointed CEO and co-chairman of Warner Records. He assumed the position in October 2018. He said that increasing the focus on pop and hip hop artists were among his goals as Warner's CEO; since then, the label has had #1 hits with Saweetie featuring Doja Cat (\"Best Friend\"), Dua Lipa (\"Levitating\") and Bebe Rexha (\"Meant to Be\"); and signed artists including Zach Bryan, Teddy Swims, NLE Choppa, Benson Boone, Veeze, and Omar Apollo.\nBay-Schuck was an executive producer of the 2021 documentary Tom Petty, Somewhere You Feel Free: The Making of Wildflowers. The film won a Producers Guild Award in 2022.   He was included in the Billboard Power 100  in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023. He appeared on the Billboard Country Power Players list in 2024. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWarner Records\nAsylum Records is an American record label, founded in 1971 by David Geffen and partner Elliot Roberts. It was taken over by Warner Communications (now the Warner Music Group) in 1972, and later merged with Elektra Records to become Elektra/Asylum Records.\nAfter previous incarnations, it is geared primarily towards hip-hop, along with rock and alternative metal. It is owned and distributed by Warner Music Group.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation ===\n\nAsylum was founded in 1971 by David Geffen, and partner Elliot Roberts, both of whom had previously worked as agents at the William Morris Agency, and operated a folk/rock label. They had also previously founded their own management company. While unsuccessfully pitching a recording contract for their client Jackson Browne to Atlantic Records president Ahmet Ertegun, Geffen said, \"You'll make a lot of money.\" Ertegun replied, \"You know what, David, I have a lot of money. Why don't you start a record company and then you'll have a lot of money.\" A deal was then struck in which Ertegun would put up the initial funds, Atlantic Records would distribute Asylum Records, and the profits would be split 50/50.\nAlthough they knew they would sign Browne, the first act that Geffen asked to join the label was his close friend Laura Nyro, whose career he was managing at the time. Nyro initially agreed, but without Geffen's knowledge she changed her mind and re-signed with Columbia Records. Geffen said it was the biggest betrayal of his life up to that point and that he \"cried for days\".\nAsylum's early releases were distributed by Atlantic Records. The same year, Asylum signed Jo Jo Gunne, Linda Ronstadt, John David Souther, Judee Sill, David Blue, Joni Mitchell and Glenn Frey (whom Geffen encouraged to form the Eagles, with Don Henley, Bernie Leadon, and Randy Meisner). In 1972, then folk-based singer/songwriter Tom Waits signed with the label, releasing his debut, Closing Time, in 1973. His seventh and final album for the label, Heartattack and Vine, was released in 1980. Former Creedence Clearwater Revival frontman John Fogerty signed with the label in 1974. The biggest coup for Asylum was signing Bob Dylan, who had been with Columbia Records since the early 1960s but who, after a falling-out with the company, was shopping around for a new label. Dylan recorded two albums, Planet Waves and the live Before the Flood, for Asylum before returning to Columbia. Columbia reissued Dylan's two Asylum albums in 1981.\n\n\n=== Merger with Elektra Records ===\n \n\nAsylum was taken over by Warner Communications in 1973 and merged with Elektra Records to become Elektra/Asylum Records. David Geffen and Elliot Roberts each received $2 million in cash and $5 million in Warner Communications stock, thereby becoming two of the company's largest shareholders. Geffen served as president and chairman of Elektra/Asylum Records until 1975, when he crossed over to film and was named vice-chairman of Warner Bros. One of Asylum's most prominent signings after Geffen's departure was Warren Zevon, who released a series of successful and critically acclaimed LPs for the label; his self-titled 1976 label debut has been called the best California rock album of the decade.\nBy the early 1980s, although the copyright lines on albums still read \"Elektra/Asylum Records\" or \"Elektra/Asylum/Nonesuch Records\", Elektra was becoming the more prominent of the two labels with Asylum turning into a secondary imprint. By the middle of the decade, the company was unofficially calling itself Elektra Records, and in 1989 it was renamed Elektra Entertainment. By this time Asylum's remaining acts had been shifted to the Elektra roster, although catalog recordings and reissues continued to be sold with the Asylum label on them.\n\n\n=== Country format ===\nAsylum was reformatted into a country music label, still operated by Elektra, in 1992. Under the new format, Asylum scored successful recordings by such acts as Emmylou Harris, Brother Phelps, Thrashe\nParlophone Records Limited (also known as Parlophone Records and Parlophone) is a record label founded in Germany in 1896 by the Carl Lindström Company as Parlophon. The British branch of the label was founded on 8 August 1923 as the Parlophone Company Limited (the Parlophone Co. Ltd.), which developed a reputation in the 1920s as a jazz record label. On 5 October 1926, the Columbia Graphophone Company acquired Parlophone's business, name, logo, and release library, and merged with the Gramophone Company on 31 March 1931 to become Electric & Musical Industries Limited (EMI). George Martin joined Parlophone in 1950 as assistant to Oscar Preuss (who had set up the London branch of the company in 1923), the label manager, taking over as manager in 1955. Martin produced and released a mix of recordings, including by comedian Peter Sellers, pianist Mrs Mills, and teen idol Adam Faith.\nIn 1962, Martin signed the Beatles, a beat group from Liverpool who earlier that year had been rejected by Decca Records. During the 1960s, when Cilla Black, Billy J. Kramer, the Fourmost, and the Hollies also signed, Parlophone became one of the world's most famous labels. For several years, Parlophone claimed the best-selling UK single, \"She Loves You\", and the best-selling UK album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, both by the Beatles. The label placed seven singles at number 1 during 1964, when it claimed top spot on the UK Albums Chart for 40 weeks. Parlophone continued as a division of EMI until it was merged into the Gramophone Co. on 1 July 1965. On 1 July 1973, the Gramophone Co. was renamed EMI Records Limited.\nOn 28 September 2012, regulators approved Universal Music Group's (UMG) planned acquisition of EMI on condition that its EMI Records group would be divested from the combined group. EMI Records Ltd included Parlophone (except the Beatles' catalogue) and other labels to be divested and were for a short time operated in a single entity known as the Parlophone Label Group (PLG), while UMG pended their sale. Warner Music Group (WMG) acquired Parlophone and [PLG] on 7 February 2013, making Parlophone their third flagship label alongside Warner and Atlantic. PLG was renamed Parlophone Records Limited in May 2013. Parlophone is the oldest of WMG's \"flagship\" record labels.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nParlophone was founded \"Parlophon\" by Carl Lindström Company in 1896. The name Parlophon was used for gramophones before the company began making records of their own. The label's ₤ trademark is a stylised blackletter L (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            L\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {L}}}\n  \n) that stands for Lindström. (Its resemblance to the British pound sign £ and the Italian lira sign ₤ is coincidental: both derive from the letter L used as an abbreviation for the Ancient Roman unit of measurement libra.) On 8 August 1923, the British branch of \"Parlophone\" (with the \"e\" added) was established, led by A&R manager Oscar Preuss. In its early years, Parlophone established itself as a leading jazz label in Britain.\n\n\n=== EMI years and initial success ===\n\nIn 1927, the Columbia Graphophone Company acquired a controlling interest in the Carl Lindström Company, including Parlophone. Parlophone became a subsidiary of Electric & Musical Industries (EMI), after Columbia Graphophone merged with the Gramophone Company in 1931.\nIn 1950, Oscar Preuss hired producer George Martin as his assistant. When Preuss retired in 1955, Martin succeeded him as Parlophone's manager. Parlophone specialized in mainly classical music, cast recordings, and regional British music, but Martin also expanded the reach into novelty and comedy records. One notable example is The Best of Sellers, a collection of sketches and comic songs by Peter Sellers undertaken in the guise of a variety of comic characters. It reached number three in the UK Albums Chart in 1958. Others include the albums of the comedy music dou\nEast West Records (stylized as eastwest) is a record label formed in 1955, distributed and owned by Warner Music Group, headquartered in New York City.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAfter its creation in 1955 by Atlantic Records, the label had its first hit with the Kingsmen's \"Week End\".  \nIn 1990, Atlantic revamped the imprint as EastWest Records America, appointing Sylvia Rhone as President & CEO. Under Rhone's leadership, EastWest Records America shot to mega success with several multi-platinum artists such as En Vogue, Pantera, Adina Howard, Gerald Levert, AC/DC, The Rembrandts, Dream Theater, Missy Elliott and MC Lyte. UK artists on the EastWest label included The Beloved, Tanita Tikaram, Chris Rea, Billy Mackenzie (as Associates) and Simply Red. EastWest also distributed imprints, such as Interscope Records, Motor Jams Records, Mecca Don Records, and The Gold Mind Inc. \nIn 2005, WMG reactivated the East West label, which marketed and distributed rock music. East West operated under Warner's Alternative Distribution Alliance, the successor to Independent Label Group. \nEast West Records was revived in the UK in 2014 under the direction of Max Lousada, then Chairman & CEO, Warner Music UK.\n\n\n=== 2024 – present ===\nIn 2024, Eric Wong was named President, East West Records & Head of Global A&R, Warner Recorded Music, reporting directly to WMG's CEO, Robert Kyncl. \nWong leads East West Records, a storied name in WMG history, which now serves as a connector across the company's global ecosystem – identifying local talents with global potential and accelerating their pathway to global success.

Records), and based in New York City. Founded by Jac Holzman in 1964 as a budget classical label, Nonesuch has developed into a label that records critically acclaimed music from a wide range of genres. Robert Hurwitz was president of the company from 1984 to 2017.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\nNonesuch was founded in early 1964 by Jac Holzman to produce \"fine records at the same price as a trade paperback\", which would be half the price of a normal LP. To achieve this, he licensed European recordings of classical music as it would be too expensive to record new material. Originally the label concentrated heavily on chamber and baroque music, often with (then) unique repertory, and typically sold at less-than-premium prices. Upon its formation, Nonesuch operated as a subsidiary label of Elektra Records, which Holzman had launched in 1950. In 1970, Holzman sold Elektra and Nonesuch to Kinney National Company, which became Warner Communications and later part of Time Warner's Warner Music Group. In 2004, Warner Music Group became an independently owned, publicly traded company.\nThe 1968 catalogue already listed over 200 albums. During the first years, the focus was clearly set on early music, i.e. music that was composed before 1800. Some artists were frequently appearing:\n\nKarl Ristenpart with his Chamber Orchestra of the Saar with different works by Johann Sebastian Bach and other baroque composers.\nLeslie Jones with The Little Orchestra of London recorded many symphonies by Joseph Haydn, as well as other works from the same period.\nThe French violinist and conductor Roland Douatte, together with his Collegium Musicum de Paris, recorded several works by Johann Sebastian Bach, Georg Philipp Telemann, and Antonio Vivaldi.\nThe Danish organist Jørgen Ernst Hansen recorded works by Dietrich Buxtehude and Johann Pachelbel, and started the series “Master Works for Organ” which included works by baroque masters, played at different organs in Europe. The series subsequently counted eleven volumes (not all played by Hansen though).\nThere was some later music as well. Günter Wand conducted Ludwig van Beethoven's Missa solemnis, Carl Schuricht conducted Anton Bruckners 7th Symphony, and Pierre Boulez with Orchestre National de la R.T.F played The Rite of Spring.\n\n\n=== 1965-1979: Teresa Sterne ===\nTeresa Sterne led Nonesuch Records from 1965 until 1979; she was responsible not only for all of the artists & repertory decisions but also for overseeing the increasingly distinctive look of the record jackets. Sterne oversaw several firsts for the label, including early electronic releases. Nonesuch commissioned Morton Subotnick's 1967 album Silver Apples of the Moon (made on the Buchla 100), and in 1966 released a 2-LP set of Moog sounds with 16-page booklet called The Nonesuch Guide to Electronic Music by Beaver & Krause (which spent 26 weeks in Billboard's Top 100 chart).\nAmong the most notable achievements of Sterne's time at the label were the release of George Crumb's Ancient Voices of Children, inspired by the poems of Federico García Lorca, which sold more than 70,000 units; the recording of new works by Elliott Carter, including his first and second string quartets; and the commissioning and release of Charles Wuorinen's Time's Encomium, which became the first electronic work to win the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1970. Under Sterne, Nonesuch helped spark a ragtime revival in the United States with the release of a series of Scott Joplin piano rags performed by Joshua Rifkin. Sterne also launched the groundbreaking Explorer Series, building the foundation for the field of world music.\nSterne's abrupt termination in December 1979 prompted some two dozen Nonesuch artists to write a letter to the editor of the New York Times speaking out against the decision; several noteworthy composers, Elliott \nGeffen Records (formerly Geffen Records Inc. until 2004) is an American record label, founded in 1980 by David Geffen. Originally a music subsidiary of the now-defunct Geffen Pictures, it is owned by the Interscope Geffen A&M (IGA) faction of Universal Music Group (UMG).\nGeffen has been a part of IGA since 1999 and has been used by Universal Music as a syndicating division of Interscope Records, serving its purpose to operate as a premier label for many new releases since 2003 and its 2017 reboot. At the same time, it is projected to reissue many releases from recording labels (some of which have been directly absorbed into Geffen) such as Decca Records (exclusively the American pop/rock catalog), Kapp Records, DreamWorks Records, MCA Records, Uni Records, Chess Records, Almo Sounds (Interscope has managed reissues of the label in 2015), Dot Records, ABC Records (primarily its pop, rock, and R&B recordings) and DGC Records (the label had merged into Geffen in 2021 with reissues now being handled by the parent label).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation (1980–1990) ===\n\nGeffen Records began operations in 1980. It was created by music industry businessman David Geffen who, in the early 1970s, had co-founded Asylum Records with Elliot Roberts. Geffen stepped down from Asylum in 1975, when he crossed over to film and was named a vice president of Warner Bros. Pictures. He was fired from Warner c. 1978, but still remained locked in a five-year contract, which prevented him from working elsewhere. When that deal expired, he returned to work in 1980 and struck a deal with Warner Bros. Records (now simply Warner Records, due to the label's disassociation from Warner Bros. Pictures in 2004), to create Geffen Records. Warner Bros. Records provided 100 percent of the funding for the label's start-up and operations, while it distributed its releases in North America, with CBS's Epic Records handling distribution in the rest of the world until 1985 when Warner Music Group (parent company of Warner Records and formerly a division of Time Warner/Warner Bros. Discovery until 2004) took over distribution for the rest of the world. Profits were split 50% each between Geffen Records and its respective distributors. Despite being named for founder and original owner David Geffen, it has been acknowledged that Ed Rosenblatt, who became president of Geffen Records upon its inception in 1980, was the one who led Geffen Records during its heyday in the 1980s and 1990s.\nThe label's first artist signing was superstar Donna Summer, whose gold-selling album The Wanderer became the label's first release in 1980. At the time, Donna Summer was undergoing a dispersing contract with and subsequent lawsuit against Universal Music Group's Casablanca Records. The label then released Double Fantasy by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. Two weeks after it entered the charts, Lennon was murdered in New York City. Subsequently, the album went on to sell millions and gave Geffen its first number-one album and single; the rights to the album would later be taken over by EMI, which eventually would be absorbed by Geffen's then-future parent, Universal Music Group in 2012.\nAs the mid-1980s progressed, Geffen would go on to have extended success with such acts as Asia, Berlin, Enya, Kylie Minogue, Quarterflash, Wang Chung, and Sammy Hagar. The label also signed several established acts such as Elton John, Irene Cara, Cher, Debbie Harry, Don Henley, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Peter Gabriel, and Jennifer Holliday. Toward the end of the decade, the company also began making a name for itself as an emerging rock label, thanks to the success of Whitesnake (U.S. and Canada only), The Stone Roses, Guns N' Roses, Tesla, Sonic Youth and the comeback of 1970s-era rockers Aerosmith. This prompted Geffen to create a subsidiary label, DGC Records (formerly the David Geffen Company), in 1990; which focused on more progressive rock and would later embrace the emergence of alternative rock—Nirvana b\nAlamo Records (previously Cold Heat Records) is an American record label that was founded in 2016 by American music industry executive, Todd Moscowitz.

Records entered into a partnership with Tommy Boy and acquired half of the label, and it allowed the label to use independent distribution as it saw fit, with the option to distribute artists through the major-label channel through Warner Bros. Records or sister label Reprise Records.\n\nMonica Lynch, who was one of the first employees hired by Tom Silverman, became president of the label in 1985. As A&R for the label, she signed and managed Queen Latifah, De La Soul, and host of hip hop musicians. Even though the male–female power struggle in hip hop music has always been present, Lynch and her peers said that the early days of hip hop were magical times for women looking to make it in the record business. Julie Greenwald, Sylvia Robinson, DJ Jazzy Joyce, Mona Scott, and Claudine Joseph also made their mark on different areas of hip-hop. Greenwald and Robinson, like Lynch, became powerful music executives. For more than 25 years, DJ Jazzy Joyce has been one of the most visible and in-demand female turntablists. And Scott and Joseph have managed the careers of some of the biggest names in hip-hop. \"Hip-hop provided a tremendous amount of opportunities for women, which might seem antithetical because of the association that many people have with misogyny and hip-hop,\" says Lynch. \"There has been a lot of attention paid to misogynist lyrics in hip-hop over the years, and I'm not going to defend or damn it. I think it exists, but some of the people who helped put those records out were women.\"According to Jeff \"Chairman\" Mao, a key DJ in 1990s underground hip-hop and online hip-hop radio host, Monica Lynch managed the careers of Afrika Bambaataa & Soulsonic Force, Stetsasonic, Queen Latifah, De La Soul, Naughty by Nature among others.\nThe label had several joint ventures in the mid 1990s including Penalty Recordings, Stepsun, Beyond, and Ignition. The label also had deals with labels such as Timber Records and distribution deals with Outcaste Records and 75 Ark, while also giving independent distribution to sister imprints that already had label deals with WEA, including American Recordings' Ill Labels, Mute Records' NovaMute, and Cold Chillin Records' Livin' Large.\nIn 1997, Tommy Boy launched an imprint label called Upaya to pursue the growing interest in spirituality and spiritual/world music. The imprint Tommy Boy Gospel was launched in 1998 under the direction of Max Seigel and Marvie Wright. That same year, the imprints Tommy Boy Black Label, which specialized in underground hip hop music, and Tommy Boy Silver Label, which specialized in dance music, were founded.\nIn 2001, while still affiliated with Warner Music, Tommy Boy Records founder Tom Silverman formed Tommy Boy Films, a TV and film division with Kung Faux creator and Dubtitled Entertainment founder, Michael \"Mic\" Neumann.\n\n\n=== 2002–2021: Independence ===\nIn 2002, Tommy Boy Records became independent again after it ended its joint venture with Warner Bros. Records, which wanted greater unit sales, and the master tapes released until that time became property of Warner Music, while the Tommy Boy trademark remained with Tom Silverman. The then-\nWarner Classics is the classical music arm of Warner Music Group. The label began issuing new recordings under the Warner Classics banner in 1991. The company also includes the Erato Records and Teldec Records labels. Based in France, Warner Classics also distributes the Elektra Nonesuch, Finlandia, Lontano, NVC Arts, Warner Apex, Warner Elatus and Warner Fonit labels.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhat was then known as Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, which owned Warner Bros. Records and Atlantic Records, acquired Elektra Records in 1969 which included Elektra's Nonesuch Records classical music label. This led to the formation of WEA, the forerunner of Warner Music Group. Nonesuch is now part of Warner Records. WEA acquired Teldec Records in 1988. Warner Classics was formed in 1991. The renamed Warner Music Group acquired Erato Records in 1992. Warner Music Group acquired the classical video company NVC Arts in 1994.\nThe label developed a larger profile in 2013 when it absorbed EMI Classics (including Pye Records' classical music catalogue) with that label's output absorbed into the Warner Classics label and the co-owned Virgin Classics absorbed into Erato Records.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nElektra Records (or Elektra Entertainment) is an American record label owned by Warner Music Group, founded in 1950 by Jac Holzman and Paul Rickolt. It played an important role in the development of contemporary folk and rock music between the 1950s and 1970s. In 2004, it was consolidated into WMG's Atlantic Records Group. After five years of dormancy, the label was revived as an imprint of Atlantic in 2009. In October 2018, Elektra was detached from the Atlantic Records umbrella and reorganized into Elektra Music Group, once again operating as an independently managed frontline label of Warner Music. In June 2022, Elektra Music Group was merged with 300 Entertainment to create the umbrella label 300 Elektra Entertainment (3EE), though both Elektra and 300 continued to maintain their separate identities as labels.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1950–1971: Founding and early history ===\nElektra was formed in 1950, as the Elektra-Stratford Record Corporation, with a singles label called Stratford Records, by Jac Holzman and Paul Rickolt in Holzman's St. John's College dorm room. Each invested $300. The usual spelling of the Greek mythological Pleiad Electra was changed. Holzman famously explained, \"I gave her the 'K' that I lacked\". He found the 'C' in the original name \"too soft\", but liked the \"solid bite\" of the letter 'K', citing its use in the Kodak name.\nThe first Elektra LP, New Songs (EKLP 1 released March 1951), was a collection of Lieder and similar art songs, which sold few copies. During the 1950s and early 1960s, the label concentrated on folk music recordings, releasing a number of best-selling albums by Theodore Bikel, Ed McCurdy, Oscar Brand, and Judy Collins, and protest singers such as Phil Ochs and Tom Paxton. Holzman also recorded Josh White, who was without a record deal as a result of McCarthyite blacklisting.\n\nIn 1964, Elektra launched Nonesuch Records. This classical budget label was the best-selling budget classical label of the era. Other labels followed suit by starting their own budget series, but Nonesuch remained the most popular and Jac Holzman states in his book that profits from the budget classical label made it possible for Elektra to experiment with their pop releases by the mid-1960s.\nIn 1965, Elektra began a short-lived joint venture with Survey Music called Bounty Records, which was Elektra's first foray into pop music. The most notable signing for Bounty was the Paul Butterfield Band who was moved over to Elektra when Bounty folded.\nElektra's entrance into pop gained the label considerable prestige within the music scene by being one of the first labels to sign up leading acts from the new wave of American psychedelic rock of 1966–1967. The label's most important signings were the Chicago-based Paul Butterfield Blues Band (with Mike Bloomfield), the Los Angeles bands Love and The Doors, and the Detroit bands The Stooges and MC5. Included in Elektra's Los Angeles-based signings were Tim Buckley and Bread. In 1968, the label also signed pioneering rock guitar soloist Lonnie Mack to a three-album deal.\nAlso in 1967, Elektra launched its Nonesuch Explorer Series, one of the first collections of what is now referred to as world music. Excerpts from several Nonesuch Explorer recordings were later included on the two Voyager Golden Discs, which were sent into deep space in 1977 aboard the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 space probes.\n\n\n=== 1971–1989: Elektra/Asylum Records ===\nElektra, along with its Nonesuch Records subsidiary, was acquired by Kinney National Services in 1970, which changed its name to Warner Communications in 1972. Soon afterwards, Kinney consolidated their label holdings under the Warner-Elektra-Atlantic umbrella. Holzman remained in charge of Elektra until 1972, when it merged with Asylum Records to become Elektra/Asylum Records; Asylum's founder, David Geffen, headed the newly combined label. Holzman, in the meantime, was appointed senior vice president and chief technologist for Warner — us\nLenny Waronker (born October 3, 1941) is an American record producer and music industry executive. As the president of Warner Bros. Records, and later, as the co-founder and co-chair of DreamWorks Records, Waronker was noted for his commitment to artists and his belief that \"music, not money, was still number one.\"\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWaronker was born in 1941 in Los Angeles, California and grew up in Pacific Palisades, California.  His father, Simon Waronker, a classical violinist, performed with the 20th Century Fox Orchestra from 1936 through 1939, and served as the orchestra's contractor at the studio from 1939 to 1955.  When Waronker was 13, his father founded Liberty Records (he was the inspiration for one of the Chipmunks being named \"Simon\").  With a roster that included Julie London, Johnny Burnette, Eddie Cochran, The Chipmunks, Bobby Vee, Jan and Dean, Johnny Duffy, the Ventures and the Fleetwoods, Liberty became one of the most successful independent labels of the post-World War II period. Liberty's first release was an orchestral composition entitled \"The Girl Upstairs\" by Lionel Newman. Newman's nephew Randy Newman and Waronker – raised in the same neighborhood – were close friends.  They frequently visited the Liberty Records office, where they would watch recording sessions and study studio personnel.  Waronker had little interest in becoming a musician, and gravitated instead towards production.  \"I remember going to Randy's house and saying 'why don't we figure out the arrangement for some standard?'  And it was just amazing:  He'd take any odd standard song and he'd sit down and mess with it and come up with a pop arrangement,\" he said in a 1994 interview with Billboard.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Liberty Records, Metric ===\nAt his father's urging, Waronker –  by then educated in songwriting, the music industry, and publishing – attended USC, where he studied music and business.  As he had in high school, Waronker worked in the A&R department at Liberty during summer breaks. Notably, in addition to serving as a gofer,  Waronker worked with staff producer Snuff Garrett.  Garrett, who was legendary for his \"shrewd ability to identify a good song and know what singer could do it justice\" heavily influenced Waronker as he learned about production.\nWaronker was additionally exposed to songwriters including Burt Bacharach, Mort Shuman, Carole King, Gerry Goffin, Barry Mann, Cynthia Weil, and Doc Pomus.\nAfter his college graduation in 1961,  Waronker was employed by Liberty full-time, working in the label's promotion department. A year later,  he transferred to Liberty's publishing arm, Metric Music, where he worked for Mike Gould and, briefly, as an assistant to Tommy LiPuma.  At Metric, Waronker produced song demos; out of a fear that the producers would \"mess up the song or the arrangement\", Waronker learned how to make the demos sound like fully produced records with limited funds, and how to take advantage of \"moments within a song\".\nAt Metric, Waronker pitched songs to Dick Glasser at Warner Bros. and Jimmy Bowen at Reprise. Impressed by his song demos, Bowen and Glasser recommended Waronker to Reprise label president Mo Ostin.  Ostin subsequently hired him as a junior A&R representative for Reprise and for Warner Bros., which was then run by Joe Smith.  Charged with developing artists who were originally on the roster of Autumn Records, a defunct label Reprise had acquired, Waronker produced the Mojo Men's \"Sit Down, I Think I Love You,\" hiring Newman on piano and Van Dyke Parks as an arranger. He also produced Harpers Bizarre's \"The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy),\" which he hired Leon Russell to arrange.  Both songs were hits.\n\n\n=== Warner/Reprise, relationship with Mo Ostin, head of A&R ===\nAt the time, Warner/Reprise was characterized by a roster which included Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Petula Clark, Peter, Paul & Mary, and Sonny and Cher.  The perception of the label shifted as Ostin a",

Unfortunately for Warner Bros., the dual impact of the Great Depression and the introduction of broadcast radio greatly harmed the recording industry—sales crashed, dropping by around 90% from more than 100 million records in 1927 to fewer than 10 million by 1932 and major companies were forced to halve the price of records from 75 to 35 cents."

Warner Bros. sold Brunswick a second time (along with Brunswick's back catalog up to 1931) in 1941, this time along with the old Brunswick pressing plants Warner owned, to Decca Records (which formed its American operations in 1934) in exchange for a financial interest in Decca. The heavy loss it incurred in the Brunswick deal kept the studio out of the record business for almost 20 years, and during this period it licensed its film music to other companies for release as soundtrack albums."

Soon thereafter, he garnered the nickname \"The Chairman of the Board\". Because of dissatisfaction with Capitol Records, and after trying to buy Norman Granz's Verve Records, the first album Sinatra released on Reprise was Ring-a-Ding-Ding! As CEO of Reprise, Sinatra recruited several artists for the fledgling label, such as fellow Rat Pack members Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. The original roster from 1961 to 1963 included Bing Crosby, Jo Stafford, Rosemary Clooney, Duke Ellington, Nancy Sinatra, Esquivel and stand-up comedian Redd Foxx. The original Reprise LP label had four different logos, depending on the genre: a riverboat for Pop records (pictured), a cherub for Jazz records, an owl for Spoken Word/Comedy records, and a picture of Sinatra for his records."

In Martin's case, his Reprise recordings were out of print for nearly 20 years before a deal was struck with Capitol Records.

Reprise president Mo Ostin was retained as the head of the label and he went on to play a very significant role in the history of the Warner group of labels over the next four decades. Warner-Reprise executives began targeting younger acts, beginning by securing the American distribution rights to the Pye Records recordings by the Kinks in 1964. Reprise soon added teen-oriented pop acts like Dino, Desi & Billy to the roster. As well, Sinatra's own daughter Nancy (who began recording for the label in 1961) was retained by Ostin, becoming a major pop star from late 1965. The label moved almost exclusively to rock-oriented music in the late 1960s, although Frank Sinatra continued to record for the label until the 1980s."

As in many other immigrant families, the elder Wonsal children gradually acquired anglicized versions of their Yiddish-sounding names: Szmuel Wonsal became Samuel Warner (nicknamed \"Sam\"), Hirsz Wonsal became Harry Warner, and Aaron Wonsal (although born with a given name common in the Americas) became Albert Warner.

Originally the label concentrated heavily on chamber and baroque music, often with (then) unique repertory, and typically sold at less-than-premium prices. Upon its formation, Nonesuch operated as a subsidiary label of Elektra Records, which Holzman had launched in 1950. In 1970, Holzman sold Elektra and Nonesuch to Kinney National Company, which became Warner Communications and later part of Time Warner's Warner Music Group.

The most notable signing for Bounty was the Paul Butterfield Band who was moved over to Elektra when Bounty folded."

Rumours, the band's second album with Nicks, became one of the best-selling albums worldwide, being certified 20× platinum in the US. In 1981, while remaining a member of Fleetwood Mac, Nicks began her solo career, releasing the studio album Bella Donna, which topped the Billboard 200 and has reached multiplatinum status. She has released eight studio albums as a solo artist and seven with Fleetwood Mac, selling a certified total of 65 million copies in the U.S. alone.\nAfter the release of her first solo album, Rolling Stone named her the \"Reigning Queen of Rock and Roll\". Nicks was named one of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time and one of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time by Rolling Stone. Her Fleetwood Mac songs \"Landslide\", \"Rhiannon\", and \"Dreams\", with the last being the band's only number one hit in the U.S., together with her solo hit \"Edge of Seventeen\", have all been included in Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. She is the first woman to have been inducted twice into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: first as a member of Fleetwood Mac in 1998 and then as a solo artist in 2019.\nNicks has garnered eight Grammy Award nominations and two American Music Award nominations as a solo artist. She has won numerous awards with Fleetwood Mac, including a Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1978 for Rumours. The albums Fleetwood Mac, Rumours, and Bella Donna have been included in the \"Greatest of All Time Billboard 200 Albums\" chart by Billboard. Rumours was also rated the seventh-greatest album of all time in Rolling Stone's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", as well as the fourth-greatest album by female acts.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n\n=== 1948–1971: Early life and career beginnings ===\nStephanie Lynn \"Stevie\" Nicks was born at Good Samaritan Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona to Jess and Barbara Nicks. Nicks is of German, English, Welsh, and Irish ancestry.\nNicks's grandfather, Aaron Jess \"A.J.\" Nicks Sr., taught Nicks to sing duets with him by the time she was four years old. Nicks's mother was protective, keeping her at home \"more than most people\" and fostered in her daughter a love of fairy tales.\nAs a toddler, Stephanie could only pronounce her name as \"tee-dee\", which led to her nickname of \"Stevie\".\n\nI listened to lots of Top 40 R&B radio. I loved The Shirelles and Martha Reeves and the Vandellas; stuff like 'Remember (Walking in the Sand)' by The Shangri-Las… [My grandfather] bought me a truckload of records when I was in the fifth grade. There must have been 150 singles: country, rockabilly, some Everly Brothers, a song called 'Party Doll' that went, 'Come along and be my party doll/And I'll make love to you.'\nHer father's frequent relocation as a vice president of Greyhound had the family living in Phoenix, Albuquerque, El Paso, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. With the Goya guitar that she received for her 16th birthday, Nicks wrote her first song, titled \"I've Loved and I've Lost, and I'm Sad but Not Blue\". She spent her adolescence playing records constantly and lived in her \"own little musical world\".\nWhile attending Arcadia High School in Arcadia, California, she joined her first band, the Changing Times, a folk rock band focused on vocal harmonies.\nNicks met her future musical and romantic partner, Lindsey Buckingham, during her senior year at Menlo-Atherton High School in Atherton, California. When she saw Buckingham playing \"California Dreamin'\" at the Young Life club, she joined him in harmony.

Produced by Keith Olsen, the album was released in September 1973 by Polydor Records.\nThe album was a commercial failure on its original release, and despite the duo's subsequent success, it has yet to be commercially remastered or re-released digitally.\n\n\n== Background ==\nPrior to recording the album Buckingham Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks performed together in the Fritz Rabyne Memorial Band. The pair met while they were both attending Menlo-Atherton High School in Atherton, California, south of San Francisco. At the time, Nicks was a senior in high school and Buckingham, one year younger than she, was a junior. According to Nicks, they first met at a casual, after-school Young Life gathering in 1966. Nicks and Buckingham found themselves harmonizing to what some accounts claim was a Beach Boys song, although Nicks herself claims they sang \"California Dreamin',\" a hit single by the Mamas and the Papas, in an interview she gave with The Source in 1981. Nevertheless, Nicks and Buckingham did not collaborate again for another two years. In 1968 Buckingham invited Nicks to sing in Fritz, a band for which he was playing bass guitar and which included some of his high school friends. Nicks talks about joining Fritz in an interview with Us Magazine from 1988:\n\nI met Lindsey when I was a senior in high school and he was a junior, and we sang a song together at some after-school function. Two years later, in 1968, he called me and asked me if I wanted to be in a rock & roll band. I had been playing guitar and singing pretty much totally folk-oriented stuff. So I joined the band, and within a couple of weeks we were opening for really big shows: Jefferson Airplane, Janis Joplin. All of a sudden I was in rock & roll.\nAlthough Nicks and Buckingham never performed their own original music while in Fritz, the band provided them with the opportunity to gain experience on stage, performing in front of crowds while opening for wildly successful rock and roll acts. Grace Slick of Jefferson Airplane, Janis Joplin of Big Brother and the Holding Company and Jimi Hendrix, whom Fritz also opened for, would all prove influential on Nicks and her developing stage persona. The band manager, David Forrester, worked hard to secure a record deal for Fritz, despite their sound differing from the harder, psychedelic music of their more popular contemporaries. The pair continued to perform with Fritz for three years until the band finally dissolved in 1971. Having developed a romantic relationship in addition to their working partnership, Nicks and Buckingham decided soon afterwards to move from San Francisco to Los Angeles to pursue their dreams of being signed.\n\n\n== Recording and production ==\nWhile still performing with Fritz, Nicks had attended San Jose State University, studying Speech Communication. Buckingham joined her at college, also managing to balance school and music. In 1972, the two continued to write songs, recording demo tapes at night in Daly City on a half-inch four-track Ampex tape machine Buckingham kept at the coffee roasting plant belonging to his father. They decided to drop out of college and move to Los Angeles to pursue a record deal. Taking the Ampex tape machine with them, they continued recording songs. Nicks worked several jobs, as a hostess at Bob's Big Boy, a waitress at Clementine's and as a cleaning lady for her record producer, Keith Olsen, so as to support herself and Buckingham financially; they had decided that it would be best for him not to work and to instead focus on honing his guitar technique. It was not long before Nicks and Buckingham met engineer and producer Keith Olsen as well as the casual entrepreneurs Ted Feigin and Lee Lasseff. These two had owned White Whale Records and more recently started a production company called Anthem R\nTimespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks is a compilation album featuring songs from the solo career of American singer and songwriter Stevie Nicks. It was released on September 3, 1991. The album features many of her hit singles, along with three new songs: \"Sometimes It's a Bitch\" first single released from the album, co-written by Jon Bon Jovi), \"Love's a Hard Game to Play\" (co-written by Bret Michaels) and \"Desert Angel\" (which Nicks wrote for the men and women serving in the Gulf War). The CD's booklet contains notes written by Nicks herself about the making of each song.\nThe album debuted and peaked at number 30 on the US Billboard 200, Nicks' lowest charting album at the time, but it remained on the chart for nearly six months and, as of February 2011, the album had sold over 1.5 million copies in the United States. The album was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1997. The album also achieved a Gold certification by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipping 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom and was Nicks' third top 20 album there. The album spent four weeks at number one in New Zealand. \nThe Fleetwood Mac song \"Silver Springs\" (written by Nicks) was originally intended to be in the compilation, but Mick Fleetwood, the band's drummer, would not allow Nicks to release the song because of his plans to release it on a forthcoming Fleetwood Mac box set. This led to a dispute, resulting in Nicks leaving Fleetwood Mac for several years.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n=== Weekly charts ===\n\n\n== Certifications and sales ==\n\n\n== References ==\nEnchanted (or The Enchanted Works of Stevie Nicks) is a three-disc box set of material by American singer-songwriter and Fleetwood Mac vocalist Stevie Nicks, which encompasses her solo career from Bella Donna (1981) to Street Angel (1994) and beyond.\nThe box set contains rare B-sides, unreleased live recordings, demos, songs from soundtracks, a track from the album Buckingham Nicks (1973), outtakes from the Bella Donna and Rock a Little sessions, and a new piano recording of the Nicks-penned Fleetwood Mac song, \"Rhiannon\".

In addition to his tenure with Fleetwood Mac, Buckingham has released seven solo studio albums and three live albums. As a member of Fleetwood Mac, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. Buckingham was ranked 100th in Rolling Stone's 2011 list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". Buckingham is known for his fingerpicking guitar style.\nBuckingham joined Fleetwood Mac in 1975, replacing guitarist Bob Welch, and convinced the group to recruit his musical (and, at the time, romantic) partner Stevie Nicks as well. Buckingham and Nicks became prominent members of Fleetwood Mac during its most commercially successful period, highlighted by the multi-platinum studio album Rumours (1977), which sold over 40 million copies worldwide. Though highly successful, the group experienced almost constant creative and personal conflict, and Buckingham left the band in 1987 to focus on his solo career. Hit songs Buckingham wrote and sang with Fleetwood Mac include \"Go Your Own Way\", \"Never Going Back Again\", \"Tusk\", and \"Big Love\".\nA one-off reunion at the 1993 inauguration ball for President Bill Clinton initiated some rapprochement between the former band members, with Buckingham performing some vocals on one track of their 1995 studio album Time, and rejoining the band full-time in 1997 for the live tour and album The Dance. In 2018, Buckingham was fired from Fleetwood Mac and replaced by Mike Campbell and Neil Finn.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nLindsey Adams Buckingham was born on October 3, 1949, in Palo Alto, California, to Rutheda (née Elliott) and Morris Buckingham. He had two older brothers, Jeffrey and Gregory. Growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area community of Atherton, he attended Menlo-Atherton High School where Buckingham and his brothers were encouraged to swim competitively. Though Buckingham dropped out of athletics to pursue music, his brother Gregory went on to win a silver medal at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. Though he did not graduate, Lindsey attended San José State University, like his brother Greg and father Morris.\nBuckingham's first forays into guitar playing took place on a toy Mickey Mouse guitar, playing along to his brother Jeff's extensive collection of 45s. Noticing his talent, Buckingham's parents bought their son a $35 Harmony guitar.\nBuckingham never took guitar lessons and does not read music. By age 13, he became interested in folk music and, influenced by banjo methods, practiced the energetic style of the Kingston Trio.\n\n\n== Music career ==\nFrom 1966 to 1971, Buckingham performed psychedelic and folk rock with the high school rock band originally named the Fritz Rabyne Memorial Band as a bassist and vocalist. The band regrouped in 1967 due to band member changes and shortened their name to Fritz. Buckingham invited friend Stevie Nicks to join Fritz as a backing vocalist. Their romantic relationship began after both left Fritz five years later.\n\n\n=== 1973–1974: Buckingham Nicks ===\nBuckingham and his then-girlfriend Stevie Nicks recorded seven demos in 1972 on a half-inch 4-track Ampex recorder kept at his father's coffee-roasting plant in Daly City, then drove to Los Angeles to pursue a recording contract. In 1973, Polydor Records signed the pair. Their studio album, produced by Keith Olsen and second engineer Richard Dashut, Buckingham Nicks, was released in September 1973; however, soon after its release Polydor dropped the duo because of poor sales. To help make ends meet, Buckingham toured with Don Everly's backing band, singing Phil Everly's parts.\n\n\n=== 1975–1980: Fleetwood Mac and mainstream success ===\n\nWhile investigating Sound City recording studio in California, Mick Fleetwood heard the song \"Frozen Love\" from the Buckingham Nicks studio album.

The episode was written by James Wong and directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon. \nIn this episode, Fiona (Jessica Lange) tries to out the next Supreme with a visit by Stevie Nicks and Madison (Emma Roberts) tries to eliminate her competition for the Supremacy. This episode marks Nicks' acting debut. She agreed to do the show based on her love of Glee, another show from the same creative team. Angela Bassett, Danny Huston and Patti LuPone guest star as Marie Laveau, the Axeman, and Joan Ramsey, respectively. This episode is rated TV-MA (LV).\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\nMisty Day is overwhelmed when presented to Stevie Nicks, who gives away her trademark shawl to Misty as a lucky charm for the Seven Wonders trial. \nMarie Laveau reveals to Fiona the source of her immortality: \"to sell the soul to Papa Legba and obey his commands no matter what once a year\", which in Marie's case is to get him an innocent life starting with her own baby centuries ago.\nMadison tries to sabotage Zoe and the other witches in the race for the Supremacy.\nCordelia breaks down, feeling useless and responsible for the impending war and begins destroying the greenhouse. Shortly after, the Delphi Trust, losing half of their finances in less than 10 minutes, suspects witchcraft influence and starts planning the extermination of the Coven. Fiona summons Papa Legba, offering her soul in exchange for eternal youth and willing to do any request for it, but the spirit turns down the deal as he claims she has \"no soul to give\". After this, she becomes determined to kill all of the Coven in order to murder the new Supreme.\nMarie and Fiona decide to get rid of Nan, considering her too dangerous after she finds the stolen newborn for Papa Legba and starts claiming she would be a better and kinder Supreme. They offer her as a sacrifice to Papa Legba, drowning her in the bathtub. He accepts the substitute for the newborn and warns Laveau and Fiona of being \"trouble\" together.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRotten Tomatoes reports a 77% approval rating, based on 13 reviews. The critical consensus reads, \"The titular rock star provides grounding for \"The Magical Delights of Stevie Nicks\", an enjoyably odd episode that becomes bolder as it progresses, even if the characters and storylines grow more difficult to track.\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A− rating, saying, \"\"The Magical Delights of Stevie Nicks\" is by far the best episode of this season of American Horror Story. Freed from the constraints of its endless circling and with an actual villain to face off with, the show's characters start actually doing stuff, and the series' momentum grows exponentially.\" However, she added: \"It's also a completely ridiculous episode of television.\" Matt Fowler from IGN gave the episode a 7.3/10 rating, saying, \"While offering up a handful of surprising moments, \"The Magical Delights of Stevie Nicks\" was still Coven's weakest entry. The sick and depraved danger fell by the wayside, replaced with soap-y Supreme competitiveness.\"\nThe episode received a 1.8 18–49 ratings share and was watched by 3.49 million viewers in its original American broadcast, a decrease from the previous episode.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\"The Magical Delights of Stevie Nicks\" at IMDb\n\"The Magical Delights of Stevie Nicks\" at TV Guide.com\n24 Karat Gold: Songs from the Vault is the eighth solo studio album by the American singer-songwriter and Fleetwood Mac vocalist Stevie Nicks, released on September 30, 2014, through Reprise Records.\n\n\n== Background ==\nRecorded in Nashville and Los Angeles, the album includes new versions of demos that Nicks primarily recorded between 1969 and 1987, though two songs date back to 1994 and 1995. There is one cover on the album, \"Carousel\", a song originally written and performed by Vanessa Carlton on her album Rabbits on the Run (2011). Nicks put it on the album because it was her mother's favorite song in her last days and Carlton was present during her death. Nicks was inspired to record the album after her assistant showed her bootlegs on YouTube of the demos Nicks had recorded over the years. Included on the album is \"Blue Water\", a song that features Lady A on vocals.\nThe album sold 33,000 copies in its first week of release and debuted at #7 on the Billboard 200, giving Nicks her sixth top ten album on that chart.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Album ===\nThe album was released as standard and deluxe editions.

Additionally, several promotional singles were made available for download from the album prior to its release. \"The Dealer\", was released on August 5, 2014, followed by \"Lady\" on August 25, \"Starshine\", on September 16, and the title track on September 23, 2014.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\n24 Karat Gold: Songs from the Vault received mostly positive reviews from music critics upon its release. At Metacritic, the album has received a Metascore of 73 out of 100 based on 11 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic rated the album four and a half stars out of five and calls it \"the best-sounding record she's made since 1983's The Wild Heart.\" Writing for New York Daily News, Jim Farber gave the album three stars out of five and states: \"We get pure Stevie — needier than some might find comfortable, but also unexpectedly wise. It's too much for the casual listener but catnip for the devoted.\"\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nThe album debuted on the Billboard 200 at #7 with sales of 33,000  giving Nicks her sixth top 10 album. The album also debuted on the UK Albums chart at #14 with sales of 5,508, giving Nicks her fifth UK Top 20 album.\nNicks made various TV appearances to promote the album, including the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon where she performed \"Lady\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMain Performers\n\nStevie Nicks – vocals, keyboards\nVanessa Carlton – backing vocals on \"Carousel\"\nSharon Celani – backing vocals\nLady A (Hillary Scott, Charles Kelley, Dave Haywood) – backing vocals on \"Blue Water\"\nJessica Nicks – backing vocals on \"Carousel\"\nLori Nicks – backing vocals\nDavid A.

It is her first solo studio album since Trouble in Shangri-La (2001) and also coincides with the 30th anniversary of the release of her debut solo album Bella Donna.\nOn May 11, 2011, Billboard announced that the album had sold 52,418 copies in its first week of release and debuted at No. 6 on the Billboard 200, giving Nicks her fifth top ten album on that chart. The album spent 16 weeks within the Billboard 200 and has sold 199,000 copies in the United States as of May 2014 according to Nielsen SoundScan. In Your Dreams debuted and peaked at No. 14 on the UK Albums Chart, giving Nicks her fifth Top 20 album there. The accompanying 2011/12 tour though only fairly short, grossed $8.7 million in North America alone.\n\n\n== Background and composition ==\nIn late February 2010, David A. Stewart (musician and record producer, best known for his work with Eurythmics) revealed, using his Twitter account, that he was working with Nicks on at least four new songs, including one called \"Everybody Loves You\". A 38-second snippet of the song was posted on Stewart's Twitter account. He confirmed that he and Nicks were working on an album, and said that it is being done \"in a very new way\".\nOn March 16, 2010, Stewart reported on his Twitter that he and Nicks were now recording songs together. On BBC Radio 2 on May 3, 2010, he stated in an interview with DJ Simon Mayo that the new album will be recorded throughout June with a release later that year, however this proved premature.\nOn July 5, 2010, Stewart tweeted several pictures and messages about him and Nicks working in the studio. In one of the tweets, Stewart stated that he, Nicks, Waddy Wachtel, Mike Campbell, Michael Bradford, Mike Rowe and Steve Ferrone were all working on the album, and that Mick Fleetwood has also contributed drums to at least one track. Waddy Wachtel has been Nicks' lead guitarist for most of her solo career, featuring prominently on all of her albums to date. Stewart also stated in that tweet that seven tracks have been completed thus far and it was their final day of these sessions in the studio together. Nicks was scheduled to play five live dates in the United States in August, and then returned to the studio to complete writing and recording on the album.\nThe cover of the album was released on March 7, 2011, via Nicks' official website. The cover photograph was taken by Kristin Burns and features Nicks and a horse in a forest scene. The track listing was made available soon after.\n\n\n== Singles ==\nThe first single, \"Secret Love\", was released on January 13, 2011. The single was made available for immediate digital download by pre-ordering the album from stevienicks.warnerreprise.com.

Stewart, was also released.\n\"Soldier's Angel\" was released to some radio outlets on May 27, 2011. Although the song has not been confirmed to be a single, it has received promotional airplay from several radio stations and by purchasing the song through the Lifetime Network as a download supports \"The Yellow Ribbon Fund\" for the U.S. Military.\nOn June 16, 2011, it was announced that \"For What It's Worth\" would be released as the second single for In Your Dreams, according to a press release issued by Live Nation, which also announced Nicks' concert tour. The single was released to radio on July 11, 2011. The music video for the single was released on August 24, 2011. \"For What It's Worth\" debuted on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart at No. 25 on September 22, 2011.\nA video for \"Moonlight (A Vampire's Dream)\" was released on October 13, 2011.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nUpon release, the album received mostly pos\n\"Talk to Me\" is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Stevie Nicks for her third solo studio album Rock a Little (1985). Written by Chas Sandford, the song was released as the lead single from the album in October 1985, through Modern Records. The single became a big hit for Nicks, peaking at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for two weeks and peaking at number one on the Billboard Top Mainstream Rock Songs chart for two weeks in 1985.\n\n\n== Background and composition ==\nThe song was written by Chas Sandford, who co-wrote John Waite's 1984 hit \"Missing You\". Sandford also plays most of the instruments on \"Talk to Me\". The song was brought to Nicks' attention by producer Jimmy Iovine, \"who was always on the hunt for a hit song.\" Nicks said she didn't like the song at first because she had trouble with the vocals, but Iovine persisted and she eventually recorded it. Jim Keltner was in the studio next door doing some drum overdubs during the recording process. After Nicks explained her dilemma, Keltner gave her some words of encouragement and offered to stay with her and be her audience. Nicks sang the song twice during the session and then it was finished.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nCash Box called it \"a mid-tempo rocker which makes good uses of Nicks’ throaty lead and harmony vocals.\"  Billboard said that it \"packs a real wallop.\"\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe promotional music video shows Nicks performing the song direct to camera in a variety of different sets in what looks like a grand house. One of the sets is a long white room that looks like an art gallery and has three steps in the middle which Nicks, her backing singers Sharon Celani and Lori Perry, and two male dancers, perform choreographed dance steps together. Nicks' brother, Christopher, features in the video playing the saxophone.\n\n\n== Live performances ==\n\"Talk to Me\" made its live debut on the Rock a Little world tour in 1986. It was also included on the Canadian leg of The Other Side of the Mirror tour set in 1989. Nicks also performed on the 1991 \"Whole Lotta Trouble Tour\" to promote her greatest hits album Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks.\nThe last time it was played live was on the Street Angel Tour in 1994.\n\n\n== Single release formats ==\n\"Talk to Me\" was released as a 7-inch vinyl in many territories in the picture sleeve featured above, with \"One More Big Time Rock and Roll Star\" as its non-album B-side. Promo 7-inch singles with picture sleeve were also released in some countries, including the U.S., and featured the title track on both sides of the disc.\nPicture sleeves varied country by country in its European 7\" release, with Spain and Germany using sleeves which featured the artist name and title but no photograph, and the UK used a picture sleeve which featured the black-and-white photograph of Nicks which was used for the back cover of the Rock a Little LP sleeve. The single peaked at number 68 in the UK.\nA 3-track 12\" single was issued in the UK and Germany (but with differing picture sleeves), featuring the album version of the title track and \"One More Big Time Rock and Roll Star\" and \"Imperial Hotel\" as the B-sides.\nA 12-inch promo was released in the U.S. featuring a full-color glossy picture sleeve and additional inner sleeve, and the disc featured the title track in mono and stereo.\n\n\n== Other versions ==\nNicks re-recorded the song in 1986 for inclusion on the Time-Life compilation It's Only Rock and Roll.\nThe rock band Lovedrug included a live recording of \"Talk to Me\" on the fan-chosen covers album from the I AM LOVEDRUG campaign.

A 6-LP vinyl release was produced as well, released on June 28, 2019. The album was released through Rhino Entertainment, and was intended to coincide with Nicks's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n=== Stand Back ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\"Stand Back\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Stevie Nicks from her second solo studio album The Wild Heart (1983). The song was released as the lead single from the album in May 1983 and reached number five on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the Top Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in August of that year. \"Stand Back\" has been a staple in Nicks' live shows since its pre-album debut at the 1983 US Festival, and it has also been included in the Fleetwood Mac tour set lists since 1987.\nIn the United Kingdom, the single was Nicks' first 12-inch release, featuring a different glossy picture sleeve and the inclusion of a third track, \"Wild Heart\". A 12-inch promotional single was also released to United States radio stations in 1983, featuring a full-colour sleeve, but playing the standard album version (in mono and stereo) on both sides.\n\n\n== Background and composition ==\nNicks has often told the story of how she wrote \"Stand Back\". She wrote it on the day of her marriage to Kim Anderson on January 29, 1983. The newlyweds were driving up to San Ysidro Ranch in Santa Barbara when Prince's song \"Little Red Corvette\" came on the radio. Nicks started humming along to the melody, especially inspired by the lush synthesizers on the song. The couple retrieved a tape recorder and Nicks recorded the demo in the honeymoon suite that night. Later, when Nicks went into the studio to record the song, she called Prince and told him the story of how she wrote the song to his melody. On the night of February 8, 1983, Prince came to the studio and played synthesizers on it, although his contribution is uncredited on the album. He and Nicks did agree however to split the publishing royalties on the song 50-50. Then, she says, \"he just got up and left as if the whole thing happened in a dream.\"\nSynth player Dave Bluefield, who also programmed the song's rhythm on a DMX drum machine, said that he played the main chords on the song using an Oberheim OB-Xa synthesizer and Prince did the \"8th note up beats\" in the upper octaves during the choruses (first heard at the 0:54 mark - supposedly played with just two fingers). It's possible that Prince played other synth parts that didn't make the final mix.\nPrince, however, remarked a different story in regards to the song's drum programming and creation: \"When I got there, her and Jimmy Iovine couldn't figure out how to work the drum machine...because people were using live drums at that point...so I went down there and programmed it for them and pretty much played most of the song there in about twenty or thirty minutes\".\nThere were two mixes made of the song: the generally more well-known album version (4:48) and the edited single version (4:18). Differences between the two are somewhat subtle, but the single version tends to have more of a \"collapsed\" or \"mono\" sound to it and the electronic drum programs are mixed rather dry and flattened, especially in the song's intro bars; whereas the drum tracks on the album version are accentuated by a generous amount of reverb effect and harder compression. Acoustic drums were given a more backseat role on \"Stand Back\". There is a further \"polished\" version of the track, with crisper percussion and louder foreground synth, featured on Nicks' 1991 compilation album Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks, remixed by Chris Lord-Alge with a run time of 4:59.\n“Stand Back” is performed in the key of B minor with a tempo of 116 beats per minute in common time. The song follows a chord progression of A/G – G – D/A – A – D/A – G/B – Bm – A/B – D/A – G/A – A, and Nicks’ vocals span from A3 to B4.\n\n\n== B-side ==\n\"Garbo\", the B-side to \"Stand Back\", is a song referencing Greta Garbo. Another song, partially inspired by Garbo, called \"Greta\", appears on the 1994 album Street Angel.\nThe lyrics from the third verse of \"Vogue\", by Madonna, coincidentally mention the same first three people — Garbo, Marlene Dietrich and Marilyn Monroe (with the second and third names flippe\n\"Leather and Lace\" is a song performed by American singers Stevie Nicks and Don Henley. It was released on October 6, 1981, as the second single from Nicks' solo debut studio album Bella Donna (1981).\nNicks and Henley were romantically involved from 1977 until 1978. Nicks originally wrote the song for Waylon Jennings and Jessi Colter's duet album Leather and Lace, but the song was not included. Jennings still intended to use the song for his solo work, while Nicks became attached to the idea of the song as a duet. Nicks' version, a duet with Eagles singer Don Henley, peaked at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks in January 1982.  Jimmy Iovine was the producer.  \nThe song compares the male singer's rougher life, represented by leather, to the female singer's softer life, represented by lace, and how opposites can attract. Record World called it a \"magical ballad.\"\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Jeffery Austin and Gwen Stefani remake ==\n\nJeffery Austin and Gwen Stefani performed a cover of the song on December 14, 2015, for the season nine finale of The Voice.

Green recruited drummer Mick Fleetwood, guitarist and singer Jeremy Spencer and bassist Bob Brunning, with John McVie replacing Brunning a few weeks after the band's first public appearance at the 1967 National Jazz & Blues Festival in Windsor. The band became a five-piece in 1968 with the addition of guitarist and singer Danny Kirwan.\nPrimarily a British blues band in their early years, Fleetwood Mac achieved a UK number-one single in 1968 with the instrumental \"Albatross\", and had other UK top ten hits with \"Man of the World\", \"Oh Well\" (both 1969), and \"The Green Manalishi (With the Two Prong Crown)\" (1970). Green left the band in May 1970, with McVie's wife Christine McVie (who had previously contributed to the band as a session musician) joining as an official member on vocals and keyboards two months later. Spencer and Kirwan also left in 1971 and 1972 respectively, with Bob Welch replacing Spencer, and Bob Weston and Dave Walker replacing Kirwan. By the end of 1974, Weston and Walker had been dismissed and Welch had left, leaving the band without a guitarist or male vocalist. While Fleetwood was scouting studios in Los Angeles, he heard the American folk-rock duo Buckingham Nicks, consisting of guitarist and singer Lindsey Buckingham and singer Stevie Nicks. In December 1974, he asked Buckingham to join Fleetwood Mac. Buckingham agreed on the condition that Nicks could also join. The addition of Buckingham and Nicks gave the band a more pop rock sound, and their 1975 album Fleetwood Mac topped the Billboard 200 chart in the United States. Their next album, Rumours (1977), produced four U.S. Top 10 singles and remained at number one on the Billboard 200 for 31 weeks. It also reached the top spot in countries around the world and won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1978. Rumours has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums in history. Although each member of the band went through a breakup (John and Christine McVie, Buckingham and Nicks, and Fleetwood and his wife Jenny Boyd) while recording the album, they continued to write and record together.\nThe line-up remained stable through three more studio albums, but by the late 1980s began to disintegrate. After Buckingham left in 1987, he was replaced by Billy Burnette and Rick Vito, although Vito left in 1990 along with Nicks. A 1993 one-off performance for the first inauguration of President Bill Clinton reunited the classic 1974–1987 line-up for the first time in six years. A full-scale reunion took place four years later, and Fleetwood Mac released their fourth U.S. No. 1 album, The Dance (1997), a live album marking the 20th anniversary of Rumours and the band's 30th anniversary. Christine McVie left in 1998 after the completion of The Dance tour. Fleetwood Mac released their final studio album, Say You Will, in 2003. Christine McVie rejoined in 2014 for their On With the Show Tour. In 2018, Buckingham was fired and replaced by Mike Campbell, formerly of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and Neil Finn of Split Enz and Crowded House. After Christine McVie's death in 2022, Nicks said in 2024 that the band would not continue without her.\nFleetwood Mac have sold more than 120 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling bands. In 1979, they were honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1998, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In 2018, Fleetwood Mac received the MusiCares Person of the Year award from the Recording Academy in recognition of their artistic achievement in the music industry and dedication to philanthropy.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1967–1970: Formation and early years ===\n\nFleetwood Mac were formed in July 1967 in London, England, by Peter Green after he left the British blues band \n\"I Can't Wait\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Stevie Nicks from her third solo studio album Rock a Little (1985). Written by Nicks, Rick Nowels, and Eric Pressly, the song was released as the album's lead single in Australia, the United Kingdom and Ireland, and as the second single in the United States and Germany.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\"I Can't Wait\" was recorded in 1985 at The Village studio in West Los Angeles and was written by Nicks, Rick Nowels, and Eric Pressly. The song was produced by Nowles and Jimmy Iovine, who had worked with Nicks since her 1981 Bella Donna album but later left the Rock a Little project.\nNicks explained the song in depth in the liner notes of her 1991 compilation album Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks: \n\n\"To understand this song, you sort of have to let yourself go a little crazy. Love is blind, it never works out, but you just have to have it. I think this was about the most exciting song that I had ever heard. My friend, Rick, whom I had known since I was 18 and he was 13, brought over this track with this incredible percussion thing, and gave it to me asking me if I would listen to it and consider writing a song for it. I listened to the song once, and pretended not to be that knocked out, but the second Rick left, I ran in my little recording studio and wrote 'I Can't Wait.' It took all night, and I think it is all about how electric I felt about this music. And that night, that SATURDAY night, Rick and I went into a BIG studio and recorded it. I sang it only once, and have never sung it since in the studio. Some vocals are magic and simply not able to beat. So I let go of it, as new to me as it was; but you know, now when I hear it on the radio, this incredible feeling comes over me, like something really incredible is about to happen.\"\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\n\"I Can't Wait\" first charted in Australia, debuting on the Kent Music Report chart on 13 January 1986,  peaking at No. 20 in February. The single first entered the UK Singles Chart on 25 January 1986, peaking at No. 54 in early February; Nicks' first single to chart in the UK since \"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\" in 1981. \"I Can't Wait\" spent a week on the Irish Singles Chart peaking at No. 29 on 23 January 1986. In New Zealand, the single entered the chart on 16 February 1986, peaking at No. 39 the following week. In the United States, the single peaked inside the top 20, peaking at No. 16 for two weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 and is one of only four of Nicks' singles to enter the Dance Club Songs chart, peaking inside the top 30. In Germany, \"I Can't Wait\" entered the chart in early May 1986, peaking at No. 58 two weeks later.\nThe single's American chart run coincided with that of a Nu Shooz song also titled \"I Can't Wait\".\nThe song was re-issued as a single in the UK and Europe in October 1991, to promote the Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks compilation album. The single peaked marginally higher in the UK on this release, at No. 47 in November 1991.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video for \"I Can't Wait\" was directed by Marty Callner. The music video features Nicks, her brother Christopher, Sharon Celani, and Lori Perry-Nicks (Nicks’ longtime back-up singers), choreographer Brad Jeffries and a cheeky Mick Fleetwood on a stage and on a set of stairs.\nNicks also performs parts by herself in a small room which could be a interpreted as a prison cell. Nicks is primarily dressed in black and sings the song in front of a microphone and sometimes a tambourine, which goes back to Nicks' trademark image of her performances of \"Rhiannon\" with Fleetwood Mac.\n\nNicks says that she did drugs on the set of all her videos of the era, however, regarding the video for \"I Can't Wait\" she said in I Want My MTV: \n\"I look at that video, I look at my eyes, and I say to myself, 'Could you have laid off the pot, the coke and the tequila for three days, so you could have looked a little better? It just makes me want to go back into that vide\nThe Wild Heart is the second solo studio album by American singer and songwriter Stevie Nicks. Recording began in late 1982, shortly after the end of Fleetwood Mac's Mirage Tour. After the death of her best friend, Robin Anderson, and with new appreciation for her life and career, Nicks recorded the album in only a few months and was released on June 10, 1983, a year after Fleetwood Mac's Mirage album. It peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200 (for seven consecutive weeks) and achieved platinum status on September 12, 1983. The album has shipped 2 million copies in the US alone.\nThe album is notable for its array of prominent guest musicians. Tom Petty made a return to write \"I Will Run to You\", on which his bandmates from The Heartbreakers performed. Nicks' Fleetwood Mac bandmate, Mick Fleetwood, made an appearance on the track \"Sable on Blonde\". Toto's Steve Lukather contributed some of the guitar work on what would become the album's biggest hit single, \"Stand Back\", which also features an uncredited contribution from Prince, who played the synthesizer track. Nicks also worked with friend Sandy Stewart, who wrote the music for three tracks on the album and performed on several (Stewart would go on to write the 1987 Fleetwood Mac hit \"Seven Wonders\"). The album's final track, \"Beauty and the Beast\", features a full string section performing a score arranged and conducted by Paul Buckmaster. Nicks had recorded various other tracks prior to the album's release, including \"Violet and Blue\" which was featured on the movie soundtrack for Against All Odds, and later on Nicks' 3-disc retrospective box set Enchanted in 1998.\nThe Wild Heart was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1993, ten years after its release, denoting shipments in excess of two million copies in the United States. It spent a whole year on the Billboard 200 from June 1983 to June 1984. It has also been certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments in excess of 60,000 in the United Kingdom. Three singles were released from the album: \"Stand Back\", which charted at number five; \"If Anyone Falls\", which charted at number 14; and \"Nightbird\", which charted at number 33. \"Stand Back\" and \"If Anyone Falls\" featured accompanying music videos that went into heavy rotation on MTV. \"Nightbird\", a track that Nicks has said was her favorite on the album, was performed live on Solid Gold and Saturday Night Live.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\nThe Wild Heart: Deluxe Edition (Rhino, 2016)\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nStevie Nicks – lead and backing vocals\nSandy Stewart – synthesizers (1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9), keyboards (3), acoustic piano solo (5), lead vocals (5), additional backing vocals (5)\nRoy Bittan – synthesizers (2), acoustic piano (4, 8, 9, 10)\nBenmont Tench – organ (3, 4, 5), keyboards (7)\nDavid Foster – acoustic piano (5)\nDavid Bluefield – Oberheim OB-Xa programming (6), Oberheim DMX drum machine (6)\nPrince – synthesizers (6, uncredited)\nDavid Monday – guitars (1, 3)\nDean Parks – guitars (1)\nWaddy Wachtel – guitars (2-6, 9)\nSteve Lukather – guitars (6)\nDavid Williams – guitars (6)\nMike Campbell – guitars (7)\nTom Petty – guitars (7), lead and backing vocals (7)\nDon Felder – guitars (8)\nRoger Tausz – bass (1)\nBob Glaub – bass (2, 4, 8)\nRuss Powell - bass (3, 6)\nKenny Edwards – bass (5, 9)\nHowie Epstein – bass (7)\nJohn Beal – bass (10)\nBrad Smith – drums (1, 3), percussion (3)\nRuss Kunkel – drums (2, 4, 8), drum overdubs (6)\nMarvin Caruso – drums (5, 6)\nChet McCracken – drum overdubs (5)\nStan Lynch – drums (7)\nMick Fleetwood – drums (9)\nBobbye Hall – percussion (2, 4, 6, 8)\nIan Wallace – percussion (6)\nPhil Kenzie – saxophone (8)\nSharon Celani – backing vocals\nLori Perry-Nicks – backing vocals\nCarolyn Brooks – backing vocals (2, 10)\nString section on \"Beauty and the Beast\"\n\nPaul Buckmaster – string arrangements and conductor\nKenneth Whitfield – string arrangements\nJon Abramowitz, Seymour Barab, Jesse Levy and Fr\nFleetwood Mac are a British-American rock band originally formed in London. Formed in July 1967, the group originally consisted of lead guitarist and singer Peter Green, slide guitarist and singer Jeremy Spencer, bassist Bob Brunning and drummer Mick Fleetwood. After several personnel changes, the band's classic lineup, in place from December 1974 to September 1987, consisted of Fleetwood, bassist John McVie, keyboardist and singer Christine McVie, singer Stevie Nicks, and guitarist and singer Lindsey Buckingham. The band then underwent several more changes in personnel, with the final lineup, beginning in November 2018, consisting of Fleetwood, John and Christine McVie, Nicks, lead guitarist Mike Campbell and rhythm guitarist and singer Neil Finn. Christine McVie died in 2022, after which Nicks stated that the band would not continue without her.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1967–1973 ===\nAfter leaving John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, guitarist and vocalist Peter Green and drummer Mick Fleetwood formed Fleetwood Mac in July 1967 with slide guitarist Jeremy Spencer and bassist Bob Brunning. In September, Brunning was replaced by John McVie, Green and Fleetwood's original choice for the role. Danny Kirwan was added as a third guitarist following the release of Mr. Wonderful in August 1968. Green suddenly left the band in 1970 due to problems with drug abuse and mental health issues, playing his last show with the band on 20 May. McVie's wife Christine – who had collaborated with the band multiple times – joined on keyboards and vocals shortly after Green's departure, officially becoming a member in August.\nDuring a United States tour in February 1971, Spencer departed Fleetwood Mac after leaving the band's Los Angeles hotel and not returning; it was later revealed that he had joined the Children of God organisation. Green temporarily returned to take Spencer's place on the tour, with Bob Welch joining after its conclusion. Kirwan was fired by Fleetwood in August 1972, after he got into a drunken argument with Welch backstage, injured himself, broke his guitar and refused to perform. He was replaced by Bob Weston the following month, when vocalist Dave Walker also joined the band. Walker had left by June the following year, shortly after the release of Penguin. Weston stayed to perform on its follow-up Mystery to Me later in the year, but was fired in October after having an affair with Fleetwood's wife Jenny Boyd Fleetwood.\n\n\n=== 1974 onwards ===\nAfter spending much of the year involved in a legal dispute with former manager Clifford Davis, the four-piece Fleetwood Mac returned in late 1974 with Heroes Are Hard to Find. By the end of the year, Welch had left the band, with his replacement Lindsey Buckingham joining on New Year's Eve 1974 with his girlfriend, vocalist Stevie Nicks. This lineup of the band remained constant for over twelve years and multiple successful releases, before Buckingham left in August 1987. He was replaced by two guitarists: Billy Burnette and Rick Vito. Nicks and Christine McVie both retired from the touring lineup of the band after the last show of the Behind the Mask Tour on 7 December 1990, although McVie contributed to recordings for the band's next studio album Time in 1995. Vito also left the band in October 1991.\nThe 1974–1987 lineup of Fleetwood Mac reunited for a performance at Bill Clinton's inauguration on 20 January 1993. Nicks and Burnette left the band shortly thereafter, with Bekka Bramlett and Dave Mason, respectively, replacing the departed members later in the year. Both performed on 1995's Time, which also featured a returning Burnette on guitar. Shortly after the album was released in October, Fleetwood Mac disbanded. Within a year, however, the band had returned with a lineup including Nicks, Buckingham, the McVies and Fleetwood. They returned to touring in 1997, releasing the live album The Dance in August, before Christine McVie left again in 1998 and all but retired from music. She ult\nChristine Anne McVie ( née Perfect; 12 July 1943 – 30 November 2022) was an English musician and singer-songwriter. She was the keyboardist and one of the vocalists and songwriters of Fleetwood Mac. \nMcVie was a member of several bands, notably Chicken Shack, in the mid-1960s British blues scene. She initially began working with Fleetwood Mac as a session player in 1968, before officially joining the band two years later. Her first compositions with Fleetwood Mac appeared on their fifth album, Future Games. She remained with the band through many changes of line-up, writing songs and performing lead vocals before partially retiring in 1998. McVie was described as \"the prime mover behind some of Fleetwood Mac's biggest hits\" and eight songs she wrote or co-wrote, including \"Don't Stop\", \"Everywhere\" and \"Little Lies\", appeared on Fleetwood Mac's 1988 Greatest Hits album. She appeared as a session musician on the band's last studio album, Say You Will. McVie also released three solo studio albums and recorded a duet album with Lindsey Buckingham. McVie was noted for her light mezzo-soprano voice.\nAs a member of Fleetwood Mac, McVie was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and in 1998 received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In the same year, after almost 30 years with Fleetwood Mac, she left the band and lived in semi-retirement, releasing a solo album in 2004. She appeared on stage with Fleetwood Mac at the O2 Arena in London in September 2013 and rejoined the band in 2014 prior to their On with the Show tour.\nMcVie received a Gold Badge of Merit Award from BASCA, now The Ivors Academy, in 2006. She received the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors in 2014 and was honoured with the Trailblazer Award at the UK Americana Awards in 2021. She was also the recipient of two Grammy Awards.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nChristine Anne Perfect was born on 12 July 1943 in the village of Greenodd, in the Furness area of Lancashire. She grew up in the Bearwood area of Smethwick near Birmingham. Her father, Cyril Percy Absell Perfect, was a concert violinist and music lecturer at St Peter's College of Education, Saltley, Birmingham, and taught violin at St Philip's Grammar School, Birmingham. Perfect's mother, Beatrice Edith Maud (née Reece), was a medium, psychic, and faith healer. Perfect's grandfather was an organist at Westminster Abbey.\nPerfect was introduced to the piano when she was four, but did not study music seriously until the age of 11, when she was reintroduced to it by a local musician who was a friend of her brother John. She continued classical training to the age of 15, but shifted her musical focus to rock and roll when her brother acquired a Fats Domino songbook. Other early influences included the Everly Brothers.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early music ===\nPerfect studied sculpture at Moseley School of Art in Birmingham for five years with the aim of becoming an art teacher, and while at art school, she met  budding musicians in Britain's blues scene. Her introduction to performing music came when she met guitarist Stan Webb and bass player Andy Silvester, who were in a band called Sounds of Blue. Knowing that Perfect had musical talent, they invited her to join them. She also sang with Spencer Davis. By the time Perfect graduated from art college, Sounds of Blue had split up. She did not have enough money to launch herself into the art world and moved to London, where she worked briefly as a department-store window dresser.\n\n\n=== Chicken Shack ===\nIn 1967, Perfect heard that Silvester and Webb were forming a blues band, to be called Chicken Shack, and were looking for a pianist. She contacted them and was invited to join the band as pianist, keyboard player and backing vocalist. Chicken Shack's debut release was \"It's Okay with Me Baby\", which was written by and featured Perfect. She stayed with the band for two studio albums, and her ge\n\"Crystal\" is a song by the British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac from their 1975 eponymous album. Written by Stevie Nicks, the song originally appeared on her and Lindsey Buckingham’s studio album, Buckingham Nicks (1973). Two years later, after joining Fleetwood Mac, it was re-recorded and released for a second time. In 1998, Nicks re-recorded the song with herself on lead vocals for the Practical Magic soundtrack.\n\n\n== Background ==\n“Crystal” first appeared on Buckingham Nicks, an album recorded by Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks in 1973 prior to their time in Fleetwood Mac. In her book Stevie Nicks: Visions, Dreams & Rumours, Zoë Howe stated that the Nicks wrote \"Crystal\" with her father and grandfather in mind. Despite being written by Nicks, the song was instead sung by Buckingham partially because producer Keith Olsen believed that his vocal timbre suited the song better. This version also featured an oboe at the end of each chorus.\nFollowing the additions of Buckingham and Nicks in Fleetwood Mac, the band opted to record another version for their 1975 eponymous release, again with Buckingham on lead vocals. For this recording, Christine McVie recorded the keyboard solo on a multimoog synthesizer. \"It wasn't even mine, though. There was some mad little professor guy running around twiddling all the knobs for me while I played it. I think he slept with the damn thing\". The band previewed the song during their Fleetwood Mac Tour prior to the album’s release.\nIn 1998, Nicks recorded another version of the song for the Practical Magic soundtrack, this time with herself on lead vocals. Bob Aguirre, who played drums in a band with Nicks during the early 1970s, said that he was “floored by the way she sang it” and gave Nicks a phone call to compliment her vocal performance.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nFleetwood Mac version\nLindsey Buckingham – lead vocals, guitar\nMick Fleetwood – drums\nChristine McVie – keyboards\nJohn McVie – bass guitar\nStevie Nicks – backing vocals\n\n\n== References ==\nThe Other Side of the Mirror is the fourth solo studio album by American singer and songwriter Stevie Nicks. Released on May 30, 1989, through the Modern Records label, the album was recorded in California, New York, and Buckinghamshire in England, and is loosely based around the theme of Lewis Carroll's novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865).\nThe album was a commercial success. It reached No. 10 on the US Billboard 200, propelled by the hit single \"Rooms on Fire\" (US No. 16), and achieved Platinum status for selling in excess of one million copies. The album reached No. 3 in the United Kingdom and was certified Gold there for sales in excess of 100,000. The Other Side of the Mirror is Nicks' highest charting album to date in various European countries including Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the huge success of Fleetwood Mac's album Tango in the Night (1987) in the United Kingdom, The Other Side of the Mirror became Nicks' highest-charting solo album there, reaching No. 3 and spawning her first UK Top 40 hit with \"Rooms on Fire\" (reaching No. 16), which Nicks performed on the BBC show Top of the Pops. The album was certified gold in the United Kingdom for sales in excess of 100,000 copies. Her first, and so far only, solo tour of the United Kingdom and Europe (including Sweden, France and the Netherlands), followed the album. There was also a US tour, though Nicks has famously since commented that she has no recollection of the tours due to her increasing dependency on the prescribed tranquilizer Klonopin at that time.\nIn the United States, \"Two Kinds of Love\" was released as a single, featuring vocals by Bruce Hornsby and an instrumental interlude by Kenny G, which became Nicks' first single to fail to chart, missing both the Billboard and Cash Box charts. However, \"Long Way to Go\" gained substantial airplay, making Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart, and it also made the Top 75 on the UK Singles Chart, as did \"Whole Lotta Trouble\". Promotional music videos were shot for \"Rooms on Fire\" and \"Whole Lotta Trouble\". The former was released with two slightly different edits, while the \"Whole Lotta Trouble\" video was shot during the American leg of Nicks' tour at the Summit Arena in Houston, Texas.\nAn earlier, instrumental version of the song \"Juliet\" (titled \"Book of Miracles\") was released by Fleetwood Mac in 1987 as the B-side to \"Seven Wonders\", while “Ooh My Love” was demoed for Tango in the Night but was ultimately shelved. The song \"Cry Wolf\" was originally recorded by American singer Laura Branigan for her fifth studio album Touch (1987).\nModern Records also released a special long-form interview video on the making of the album, titled \"Reflections from the Other Side of the Mirror\", which contained newly filmed material shot by Herbert Worthington III. However, it was limited to a worldwide release of 10,000 albums and only 500 VHS releases.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nDuncan Holland, reviewer of British music newspaper Music Week, praised the album. He wrote: \"This is a remarkably strong record from the single, \"Rooms on Fire\", to the 11 other tracks on show. Some rather overworked \"Alice in Wonderland\" imagery aside, this is excellent stuff, floating, melodic, twisting and turning.\" Pete Clark of Hi-Fi News & Record Review also found some warm words. He considered that this work is destined \"for those evenings when you just have to leave your brain at the door, there are worse things that can ooze into your ears.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMusicians\n\nStevie Nicks – vocals, percussion (1, 6), tambourine (2, 4, 5, 7, 10)\nRupert Hine – keyboards, percussion (1, 3, 4, 6), drum programming (3, 9, 11, 12), synth bass (9), bass (12)\nRick Nowels – guitars (1, 2, 4), acoustic guitar (1)\nJamie West-Oram – guitars (1-4, 6, 8, 9, 11)\nWaddy Wachtel – acoustic guitar (3, 7, 9, 12), guitars (6, 7, 10)\nMike Campbell – guitars (5, 6, 7), slide acoustic guitar \n\"Edge of Seventeen\" is a song by the American singer-songwriter Stevie Nicks from her debut solo studio album Bella Donna (1981), released as the third single from the album on February 4, 1982. The lyrics were written by Nicks to express the grief resulting from the death of her uncle Jonathan and the murder of John Lennon during the same week of December 1980. The song features a distinctive, chugging 16th-note guitar riff, drum beat and a simple chord structure typical of Nicks' songs. The song's title for the single release was \"Edge of Seventeen (Just Like the White Winged Dove)\". In the United States, \"Edge of Seventeen\" just missed out on the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 11. Despite this, it became one of Nicks' most enduring and recognizable songs and has been covered by several artists. In 2021, it was ranked No. 217 on Rolling Stone's list of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".\n\n\n== Background and inspiration ==\nAccording to Nicks, the title came from a conversation she had with Tom Petty's first wife, Jane, about the couple's first meeting. Jane said they met \"at the age of seventeen\", but Jane's strong Southern accent made it sound like \"edge of seventeen\" to Nicks. She liked the sound of the phrase so much that she told Jane she would write a song for it and give her credit for the inspiration.\nAlthough Nicks had originally planned to use the title for a song about Tom and Jane Petty, the death of her uncle Jonathan and the murder of John Lennon during the same week of December 1980 inspired a new song for which Nicks used the title. Nicks' producer and lover Jimmy Iovine was a close friend of Lennon, and Nicks felt helpless to comfort him. Soon after, Nicks flew home to Phoenix, Arizona, to be with her uncle Jonathan, who was dying of cancer. She remained with her uncle and his family until his death.\nNicks had never actually heard a dove's call before, as she revealed in 2020 when she had only just heard it recently. The opening lyrics were inspired by a menu she was reading at a Phoenix restaurant in 1980, which said, \"The white wing dove sings a song that sounds like she’s singing ooh, ooh, ooh. She makes her home here in the great Saguaro cactus that provides shelter and protection for her…\".\n\n\n== Composition and lyrics ==\nAs is typical of Nicks' songs, the lyrics are highly symbolic. Nicks has said that the white-winged dove represents the spirit leaving the body on death, and some of the verses capture her experience of the days leading up to her uncle Jonathan's death.\n\nThroughout the song, a distinctive 16th note guitar riff is played by Waddy Wachtel, progressing through C, D, and E-minor chords. During the bridge, the chords alternate twice between E-minor and C. Nicks's backing band recommended that they emulate The Police's \"Bring On the Night\" for the guitar riff, although Wachtel was unfamiliar with the song.\"I had never heard \"Bring On the Night,\" and at that session they told me they were going to do this song based on this feel. I had heard something about the Police, but I didn't know what they were talking about. Then about two years ago, I had the radio on, and on comes what sounds like \"Edge of Seventeen\" – and all of a sudden, there's Sting's voice! I thought, 'We ripped them off completely!' I called Stevie that night and said, 'Listen to me, don't ever do that again!'\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRecord World praised the song for its \"powerful lyrics, a percolating rhythm section and Stevie's throaty vocal.\" Author Zoe Howe has described the song as being about \"transforming and elevating the feelings of grief and soaring above them with strength\" and being \"a perfect combination of tough rock 'n' roll grit, raw emotion and full-beam, strut-about-in-platform-boots rock queen glamour.\"\nThe song is a favourite among Nicks' fanbase.\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\n\"Edge of Seventeen\" peaked at No. 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks in April 1982. The live version on the B-side \n\"Gypsy\" is a song by British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac. The song was written by Stevie Nicks around 1979; the earliest demo recordings were made in early 1980 with Tom Moncrieff for possible inclusion on her debut solo album Bella Donna. When Nicks' close friend Robin Anderson died of leukemia, the song took on a new significance and Nicks dedicated the song to her in future performances. \"Gypsy\" was the second single release and second biggest hit from the Mirage album, following \"Hold Me\", reaching a peak of No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks.\nIn 2017, Nicks recorded an acoustic version to serve as the theme song for the Netflix drama series Gypsy.\n\n\n== Inspiration ==\nLyrically, \"Gypsy\" recounts the narrator’s early adulthood—with references to going to a clothing store in San Francisco—and reminisces about a bygone, carefree lifestyle. There are two points of inspiration behind \"Gypsy\", as stated by Stevie Nicks, the first of which is a nostalgia for her life before Fleetwood Mac. Before joining the group, Nicks lived with Lindsey Buckingham, who would also join Fleetwood Mac. Nicks and Buckingham were musical and romantic partners; however, only their musical partnership has survived. Nicks met Buckingham at a high school party, where he was singing \"California Dreaming\" by the Mamas and the Papas. Nicks joined in with perfect harmony, then they introduced themselves. They did not see each other again until college where they started a relationship and a musical duo called Buckingham Nicks. They barely got by with the income from Nicks' work as a waitress and cleaning lady.\nThey could not afford a bed frame, so they slept on a mattress directly on the floor. Nicks says the mattress was decorated in lace, with a vase and a flower at its side. Whenever she feels her famous life getting to her, she goes \"back to her roots,\" and takes her mattress off the frame and puts it \"back to the floor\" and decorates it with \"some lace, and paper flowers.\" On 31 March 2009, Nicks gave an interview to Entertainment Weekly discussing the inspiration for the song:\n\nIn the old days, before Fleetwood Mac, Lindsey [Buckingham] and I had no money, so we had a king-size mattress, but we just had it on the floor. I had old vintage coverlets on it, and even though we had no money it was still really pretty... Just that and a lamp on the floor, and that was it—there was a certain calmness about it. To this day, when I'm feeling cluttered, I will take my mattress off of my beautiful bed, wherever that may be, and put it outside my bedroom, with a table and a little lamp.\nOn 25 March 2009, during a show in Montreal, Quebec on Fleetwood Mac's Unleashed Tour, Nicks gave a short history of the inspiration behind \"Gypsy\". She explained it was written sometime in 1978–1979, when the band had become \"very famous, very fast\". It was a song that brought her back to an earlier time, to an apartment in San Francisco where she had taken the mattress off her bed and put it on the floor. To contextualize, Nicks voiced the lyrics: \"So I'm back, to the velvet underground. Back to the floor, that I love. To a room with some lace and paper flowers. Back to the gypsy that I was.\" Those are the words: 'So I'm back to the velvet underground'—which is a clothing store in downtown San Francisco, where Janis Joplin got her clothes, and Grace Slick from Jefferson Airplane. It was this little hole in the wall, amazing, beautiful stuff—'back to the floor that I love, to a room with some lace and paper flowers, back to the gypsy that I was.'\"\nThe second point of inspiration for the song is the message as a tribute to someone's passing. On 5 October 1982, Robin Snyder Anderson, Nicks' best friend, died of leukemia.\n\n\n== Stevie Nicks and Robin Snyder Anderson ==\nNicks met and befriended Robin Snyder at Arcadia High School in Los Angeles when they were either 14 or 15. Snyder, who had theatrical interests, became Nicks' speech therapist. Videos of the two prep\n\"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\" is a song recorded by Stevie Nicks and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and released as the first single from Nicks' debut solo album Bella Donna (1981). The track is the album's only song that was neither written nor co-written by Nicks. Written by Tom Petty and Mike Campbell as a Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers song, Jimmy Iovine, who was also working for Stevie Nicks at the time, arranged for her to sing on it. Petty sings with Nicks in the chorus and bridge, while his entire band provides instrumentation with the exception of Ron Blair, who was replaced by bassist Donald \"Duck\" Dunn for the recording.\nA performance of the song in the studio was used as the promotional video. The video was the 25th video to be played on MTV's launch date on August 1, 1981. Petty and Nicks also sang together on the songs \"Insider\" (from Petty's album Hard Promises (1981)) and \"I Will Run to You\" (from Nicks's album The Wild Heart (1983)), and frequently performed impromptu live versions of these and 1960s classic \"Needles and Pins\" in many shows through the 1980s.\nAs of 2017, \"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\" remains a mainstay of Stevie Nicks's solo performances, and on July 9, 2017, Nicks performed the song together with Petty and the Heartbreakers at the British Summer Time festival at Hyde Park in London, in what turned out to be their final performance of the song together before Petty's death in October 2017.\nThe song peaked at No. 3 on the American Billboard Hot 100 for six consecutive weeks, (Nicks's biggest solo hit and the Heartbreakers' biggest hit as well). However, in the United Kingdom, the song only managed to peak at No. 50 on the UK Singles Chart. \n\n\n== Content ==\nIn a November 2003 interview with Songfacts, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers guitarist and primary songwriter Mike Campbell explained the song's origins:\n\n\"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\" was a song that I had written the music and Tom had written the words. The Heartbreakers had recorded a version of it with Jimmy Iovine, and Jimmy being the entrepreneur that he was, he was working with Stevie, and I guess he asked Tom if she could try it, and it just developed from there.\nWe cut the track as a Heartbreakers record and when she decided to do it we used that track and she came in and sang over it. It became a duet. It's basically all the Heartbreakers on that record.\nThe lyrics are about a woman who feels weighed down by relationships and wants to part despite a strong sentimental attachment to her lover. The melody is described by AllMusic as \"dark and sinister\". Apart from the intro before the first verse and a solo following the second verse (where there is some fairly heavy riffing), however, the guitar sound is laid-back in typical Heartbreakers style. The song was originally recorded for Petty's album Hard Promises, but the producers felt the song came from a female point of view and it was left unreleased until it was agreed to be put on the Bella Donna album instead. A demo version of the song, recorded without Nicks, was eventually released on Petty's boxed set Playback (1995).\nBillboard called it a \"punchy uptempo piece of rock.\"  Record World said that \"Nicks' uncompromising vocal pairs perfectly with Petty.\"\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nBand\n\nStevie Nicks – lead vocals\nLori Perry – backing vocals\nSharon Celani – backing vocals\nTom Petty – co-lead vocals, guitar\nMichael Campbell – lead guitar\nBenmont Tench – organ\nStan Lynch – drums\nAdditional musicians \n\nDonald \"Duck\" Dunn – bass guitar\nPhil Jones – percussion\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Cover versions ==\nThe song was parodied by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic as \"Stop Draggin' My Car Around\" on his debut album \"Weird Al\" Yankovic (1983).\nJimmy Fallon and Stevie Nicks performed the song in a humorous recreation of the 1981 music video on The Tonight Show on April 9, 2014.\n\n\n== References ==",

She wrote it on the day of her marriage to Kim Anderson on January 29, 1983. The newlyweds were driving up to San Ysidro Ranch in Santa Barbara when Prince's song \"Little Red Corvette\" came on the radio. Nicks started humming along to the melody, especially inspired by the lush synthesizers on the song. The couple retrieved a tape recorder and Nicks recorded the demo in the honeymoon suite that night. Later, when Nicks went into the studio to record the song, she called Prince and told him the story of how she wrote the song to his melody. On the night of February 8, 1983, Prince came to the studio and played synthesizers on it, although his contribution is uncredited on the album. He and Nicks did agree however to split the publishing royalties on the song 50-50. Then, she says, \"he just got up and left as if the whole thing happened in a dream.\""

It's possible that Prince played other synth parts that didn't make the final mix.\nPrince, however, remarked a different story in regards to the song's drum programming and creation: \"When I got there, her and Jimmy Iovine couldn't figure out how to work the drum machine...because people were using live drums at that point...so I went down there and programmed it for them and pretty much played most of the song there in about twenty or thirty minutes\"."

Acoustic drums were given a more backseat role on \"Stand Back\". There is a further \"polished\" version of the track, with crisper percussion and louder foreground synth, featured on Nicks' 1991 compilation album Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks, remixed by Chris Lord-Alge with a run time of 4:59."

The track is the album's only song that was neither written nor co-written by Nicks. Written by Tom Petty and Mike Campbell as a Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers song, Jimmy Iovine, who was also working for Stevie Nicks at the time, arranged for her to sing on it. Petty sings with Nicks in the chorus and bridge, while his entire band provides instrumentation with the exception of Ron Blair, who was replaced by bassist Donald \"Duck\" Dunn for the recording."

It is one of the \"big three\" recording companies and the third-largest in the global music industry, after Universal Music Group (UMG) and Sony Music Entertainment (SME). Formerly part of Time Warner (later known as WarnerMedia, now Warner Bros. Discovery), WMG was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange from 2005 until 2011, when it announced its privatization and sale to Access Industries. It later had its second IPO on Nasdaq in 2020, once again becoming a public company. With a multibillion-dollar annual turnover, WMG employs more than 4,500 people and has operations in more than 50 countries throughout the world.\nThe company owns and operates some of the largest and most successful labels in the world, including Elektra Records, Reprise Records, Warner Records, Parlophone Records (previously owned by EMI), and Atlantic Records. WMG also owns Warner Chappell Music, one of the world's largest music publishers.\nSince August 2, 2018, WMG has expanded its business to digital media operations through its acquisition of Uproxx.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1950s and 1960s ===\nThe film studio Warner Bros. had no record label division at the time one of its contracted actors, Tab Hunter, scored a No. 1 hit song in 1957 for Dot Records, a division of rival Paramount Pictures. In order to prevent any repetition of its actors recording for rival companies, and to also capitalize on the music business, Warner Bros. Records was created in 1958; its original office was located above the film studio's machine shop on 3701 Warner Boulevard in Burbank, California. In 1963, Warner purchased Reprise Records, which had been founded by Frank Sinatra three years earlier so that he could have more creative control over his recordings. With the Reprise acquisition, Warner gained the services of Mo Ostin, who was mainly responsible for the success of Warner/Reprise.\nAfter Warner Bros. was sold to Seven Arts Productions in 1967 (forming Warner Bros.-Seven Arts), it purchased Atlantic Records, founded in 1947 and WMG's oldest label (until WMG completed its acquisition of Parlophone in 2013), as well as its subsidiary Atco Records. This acquisition brought Neil Young into the company fold, initially as a member of Buffalo Springfield. Young became one of Warner's longest-established artists, recording both as a solo artist and with groups under the Warner-owned Atlantic, Atco, and Reprise labels. Young also recorded five albums for Geffen Records during that label's period of Warner distribution. The Geffen catalogue, now owned by Universal Music Group, represents Young's only major recordings not under WMG ownership.\nAtlantic, its subsidiary Atco Records, and its affiliate Stax Records paved the way for Warner's rise to industry prominence. The purchase brought in Atlantic's lucrative back catalogue, which included classic recordings by Ray Charles, the Drifters, the Coasters, and many more. In the mid-1960s, Atlantic/Stax released a string of landmark soul music recordings by artists including Booker T & the MGs, Sam & Dave, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, Ben E. King, and Aretha Franklin. Ultimately, the sale led to Stax leaving Atlantic because Seven Arts Productions insisted on keeping the rights to Stax recordings. Atlantic moved decisively into rock and pop in the late 1960s and 1970s, signing major British and American acts including Led Zeppelin, Cream, Crosby Stills & Nash, Yes, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Genesis, Average White Band, Dr. John, King Crimson, Bette Midler, Roxy Music, and Foreigner.\nIn 1969, two years after being purchased by Seven Arts, the Warner Bros.-Seven Arts company was sold to the Kinney National Company. In mid-1972, Kinney Music of Canada, Ltd. was renamed WEA Music of Canada, Ltd.

In 1929, Warner Bros. acquired M. Witmark & Sons, Remick Music Corporation and Harms, Inc. Tamerlane Music was acquired in 1969.\nWarner Chappell Music was formed in San Antonio, Texas, in 1987, when Warner Music Group Chairman Chuck Kaye led the company to purchase Chappell & Co. from PolyGram (now Universal Music Group) (UMG). In 1988, Warner-Chappell acquired Birch Tree Group (formerly Summy Birchard), publisher of Happy Birthday to You, and the Frances Clark piano method books. In 1990, Warner Chappell acquired Mighty Three Music, the publishing company of Thom Bell and Gamble and Huff. The same year, Warner Chappell acquired the Canadian music publisher Gordon V. Thompson Music.\nIn 1994, Warner Bros. Publications expanded its print music operations by acquiring CPP/Belwin. CPP/Belwin had been the former print music arm of Columbia Pictures.\nIn 2005, Warner Chappell Music sold most of its printed music division, Warner Bros. Publications, to Alfred Publishing, and in 2006 launched the Pan European Digital Licensing (P.E.D.L.) initiative. In 2007, when Radiohead released In Rainbows through its website on a pay-what-you-wish model, Warner Chappell Music created a streamlined, one-of-a-kind licensing process for the songs on the album that allowed rights users around the world to secure use of the music from a single location.\nIn 2006, David H. Johnson was elevated to interim CEO and then in 2007 to Chairman & CEO of the company.\nIn November 2006, Disney Music Publishing and Warner Chappell agreed to a licensing agreement for Europe and South America major markets.\nIn 2007, the company acquired Non-Stop Music. Additionally, in 2010 it acquired 615 Music, a Nashville-based production music company, and subsequently united all the production music companies under the name Warner Chappell Production Music in 2012. In 2011, it acquired Southside Independent Music Publishing, whose songwriters included Bruno Mars, Brody Brown, and J.R. Rotem. In July 2012, Warner/Chappell purchased the music rights of the film studio Miramax Films.\nIt was ranked in 2010 by Music & Copyright as the world's third-largest music publisher. Among the songs in the company's library are \"Winter Wonderland\" and formerly \"Happy Birthday to You\" until the copyright of the song was invalidated in 2015 and put in the public domain the next year.\nIn January 2011, Cameron Strang, founder of New West Records and Southside Independent Music Publishing, was named CEO of Warner Chappell Music.  He was succeeded by former company president Jon Platt in 2016.\nWarner Chappell acquired Frank Gari's studio in 2015, adding to its production music library some of the most well-known television news music themes including those for local stations owned by ABC, CBS, and NBC.\nOn June 30, 2017, Warner Chappell Music filed a lawsuit against EMI Music Publishing, accusing the latter company of underpaying Warner Music for the royalties of the 20th Century Fox catalogue, which Warner acquired in 1982, as well as the rights to Curtis Mayfield and Kool and the Gang. This controversy arises from EMI's acquisition of Robbins and Feist in the early 1990s.\nOn January 9, 2019, Guy Moot was named CEO of Warner Chappell Music.  He and Carianne Marshall, the company's COO, were appointed co-chairs.\nOn January 15, 2019, Warner Chappell Music filed a monetization claim against a fanfilm created by Star Wars YouTube channel Star Wars Theory, but rescinded the claim two days later after intervention by Lucasfilm Ltd. on behalf of outraged fans.

(known as Warner Bros. Records Inc. until 2019) is an American record label.  A subsidiary of the Warner Music Group, it is headquartered in Los Angeles, California. It was founded on March 19, 1958, as the recorded music division of the American film studio Warner Bros.\nArtists who have recorded for Warner Records include  Madonna, Prince, Linkin Park, Zach Bryan, Van Halen, Kylie Minogue, ZZ Top, Gorillaz, Bette Midler, Grateful Dead, Jane's Addiction, Duran Duran, Fleetwood Mac, Rod Stewart, Funkadelic, James Taylor,  Red Hot Chili Peppers, Mac Miller, R.E.M., Bob James, David Sanborn, and the Sex Pistols.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\nAt the end of the silent movie period, Warner Bros. Pictures decided to expand into publishing and recording so that it could access low-cost music content for its films. In 1928, the studio acquired several smaller music publishing firms which included M. Witmark & Sons, Harms Inc., and a partial interest in New World Music Corp., and merged them to form the Music Publishers Holding Company. This new group controlled valuable copyrights on standards by George and Ira Gershwin and Jerome Kern, and the new division was soon earning solid profits of up to US$2 million every year.\nIn 1930, Music Publishers Holding Company (MPHC) paid US$28 million to acquire Brunswick Records (which included Vocalion), whose roster included Duke Ellington, Red Nichols, Nick Lucas, Al Jolson, Earl Burtnett, Ethel Waters, Abe Lyman, Leroy Carr, Tampa Red and Memphis Minnie, and soon after the sale to Warner Bros., the label signed rising radio and recording stars Bing Crosby, Mills Brothers, and Boswell Sisters. Unfortunately for Warner Bros., the dual impact of the Great Depression and the introduction of broadcast radio greatly harmed the recording industry—sales crashed, dropping by around 90% from more than 100 million records in 1927 to fewer than 10 million by 1932 and major companies were forced to halve the price of records from 75 to 35 cents.\nIn December 1931, Warner Bros. offloaded Brunswick to the American Record Corporation (ARC) for a fraction of its former value, in a lease arrangement which did not include Brunswick's pressing plants. Technically, Warner maintained actual ownership of Brunswick, which with the sale of ARC to CBS in 1939 and their decision to discontinue Brunswick in favor of reviving the Columbia label, reverted to Warner Bros. Warner Bros. sold Brunswick a second time (along with Brunswick's back catalog up to 1931) in 1941, this time along with the old Brunswick pressing plants Warner owned, to Decca Records (which formed its American operations in 1934) in exchange for a financial interest in Decca. The heavy loss it incurred in the Brunswick deal kept the studio out of the record business for almost 20 years, and during this period it licensed its film music to other companies for release as soundtrack albums.\n\n\n=== 1958–1963: formation and early years ===\n  \nWarner Bros. returned to the record business on March 19, 1958, with the establishment of its own recording division, Warner Bros. Records. By this time, the established Hollywood studios were reeling from multiple challenges to their former dominance—the most notable being the introduction of television in the late 1940s. Legal changes also had a major impact on their business—lawsuits brought by major stars had effectively overthrown the old studio contract system by the late 1940s and, beginning in 1949, anti-trust suits brought by the U.S. government forced the five major studios to divest their cinema chains.\nIn 1956, Harry Warner and Albert Warner sold their interest in the studio and the board was joined by new members who favored a renewed expansion into the music business—Charles Allen of the investment bank Charles Allen & Company, Serge Semenenko of the First National Bank of Boston and investor David Baird. Semenenko in particular had a strong professional interest in the entertainment \nWarner Bros. Discovery is an American multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate based in New York City.

It was headquartered at the 30 Hudson Yards complex in New York City.\nIt was established as Time Warner in 1990, following a merger between Time Inc. and Warner Communications. The company had film, television and cable operations. Its assets included WarnerMedia Studios & Networks (which consisted of the entertainment assets of Turner Broadcasting, HBO, and Cinemax as well as Warner Bros., which itself consisted of the film, animation, television studios, the company's home entertainment division and Studio Distribution Services, its joint venture with Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, DC Comics, New Line Cinema, and, together with CBS Entertainment Group, a 50% interest in The CW); WarnerMedia News & Sports (consisted of the news and sports assets of Turner Broadcasting, including CNN, Turner Sports, and AT&T SportsNet); WarnerMedia Sales & Distribution (consisted of digital media company Otter Media); and WarnerMedia Direct (consisted of the HBO Max streaming service).\nDespite spinning off Time Inc. in 2014, the company retained the Time Warner name until 2018, when the company was renamed WarnerMedia after it was acquired by AT&T. On October 22, 2016, AT&T officially announced that they intended on acquiring Time Warner for $85.4 billion (or $108.7 billion when including assumed Time Warner debt), valuing the company at $107.50 per share. The proposed merger was confirmed on June 12, 2018, after AT&T won an antitrust lawsuit that the U.S. Justice Department filed in 2017 to attempt to block the acquisition, and was completed two days later, when the company became a subsidiary of AT&T. The company's final name was adopted a day later. Under AT&T, the company moved to launch a streaming service built around the company's content, known as HBO Max. WarnerMedia refolded Turner's entertainment-based networks under a singular umbrella unit on August 10, 2020, through a consolidation of the WarnerMedia Entertainment and Warner Bros. Entertainment assets into a new unit, WarnerMedia Studios & Networks Group. On May 17, 2021, nearly three years after the acquisition, AT&T decided to leave the entertainment business by announcing that it had proposed to sell its ownership of WarnerMedia in a merger with Discovery, Inc. to form a new publicly traded company, Warner Bros. Discovery. The deal closed on April 8, 2022.\nThe company's previous assets included Time Inc., TW Telecom, AOL, Time Warner Cable, AOL Time Warner Book Group, and Warner Music Group; these operations were either sold to others or spun off as independent companies.

Records split and WEA was formed. It was first established in Canada and followed by Australia. The Australian operation began in July 1970, by Paul Turner with five staff members. The official launch was held at the Menzies Hotel in Sydney on 1 October 1970. The company was then based in Riley Street, Darlinghurst, and had three major labels: Warner Bros. Records, Elektra Records, and Atlantic Records\nA year later Warner Bros. Records worldwide (including Australia) changed its name to Kinney Music. The monopoly laws in America at the time did not allow the three labels to trade as one, so the umbrella name of Kinney Music was chosen. For the first two years, the Australian Record Company (ARC), now known as Sony Music, handled the Australian distribution.\nTurner's income for the first year was 1 million dollars. That was achieved in seven months, with the first years sales being just under $2 million. By 1 October 1972, U.S. monopoly laws had changed and WEA, using the first initial of each of the three main labels for its name, was born. From that time, WEA Australia had its own sales and distribution arm.\nWEA became a major player in the Australian recording industry, through international successes of artists such as Fleetwood Mac, Phil Collins, Eric Clapton, Led Zeppelin and The Doors.\nThe company was renamed Warner Music Australia in 1990 and split into two divisions – WEA and East-West Records. With more focus being placed on domestic signings, phenomenal success was achieved with acts such as INXS, Cold Chisel, 1927 and Jenny Morris.\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, Warner Music also invested in Brisbane bands, Regurgitator and Pretty Violet Stain. Regurgitator became Warner Music's first direct signing and remained with the company until 2004. In 2005, Sire Records invested in Brisbane band The Veronicas, who went straight to number two with their debut single \"4 Ever\" and their album \"The Secret Life of the Veronicas\".  Later that year, Warner Music Australia bought out Festival-Mushroom Records for $12 million and closed the label, while retaining the use of the Mushroom label for a couple of acts such as Eskimo Joe and Gabriella Cilmi.\nAs of 2010, the company has continued with artists such as Kerser, Lisa Mitchell, Kylie Minogue, the New Zealand band, Evermore, as well as the newly signed Brisbane act, Dead Letter Circus.

The company went public on September 21, 2021, at a valuation of €46 billion.\nAs of April 2024, UMG's catalogue includes over 3 million recordings and 4 million compositions.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe company's origins go back to the formation of the American branch of Decca Records in September 1934, and its name and company logo originate from Carl Laemmle's Universal Pictures. Although the movie studio and the music business share a common history, today the former is part of Comcast and the latter an independent commercial entity. During World War II, many record companies donated their metal masters to recycling for the war effort. However, Universal was an exception and donated more than 200,000 of their historic master recordings to the Library of Congress. The Decca Record Co. Ltd. of England spun American Decca off in 1939. MCA Inc. merged with American Decca in 1962.\nIn November 1990, Japanese multinational conglomerate Matsushita Electric agreed to acquire MCA for $6.59 billion. In 1995, Seagram acquired 80 percent of MCA from Matsushita. On December 9, 1996, the company was renamed Universal Studios, Inc., and its music division was renamed Universal Music Group; MCA Records continued as a label within the Universal Music Group. In May 1998, Seagram purchased PolyGram and merged it with Universal Music Group in early 1999. Seagram's entertainment assets were then sold to French media conglomerate Vivendi in 2000, along with UMG.\n\n\n=== 2004: Consolidating into a Vivendi subsidiary ===\nIn May 2004, Universal Music Group was cast under separate management from Universal Studios, when Vivendi sold 80% of the latter to General Electric, who subsequently merged it with NBC to form NBCUniversal. This came two months after the separation of Warner Music Group from Time Warner. In February 2006, Vivendi purchased the remaining 20 percent of UMG from Matsushita Electric. On September 6, 2006, Vivendi announced its €1.63 billion ($2.4 billion) purchase of BMG Music Publishing; after receiving European Union regulatory approval, the acquisition was completed on June 25, 2007.\n\n\n=== 2007–2012: UMG acquisitions and EMI purchase ===\nIn June 2007, UMG acquired Sanctuary, which eventually became UMG's entertainment merchandising and brand management division, Bravado. In 2008, Universal Music Group agreed to make its catalog available to Spotify, then a new streaming service, for use outside the U.S. on a limited basis.\nDoug Morris stepped down from his position as CEO on January 1, 2011.

It oversees several labels assigned to its Atlantic Records unit. In total, the label group has nearly three hundred artists on its roster.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2004, Time Warner sold Warner Music to a group of private investors. As a cost-cutting maneuver, the new owners of Warner Music Group merged Atlantic Records with its sister, Elektra Records, to form The Atlantic Records Group. Upon the merger, Elektra became largely dormant, with most of its retained roster absorbed by Atlantic.  In the years to follow, Atlantic Records Group would add a host of other labels to its umbrella, including: Roadrunner Records, Fueled by Ramen, Custard Records and Maybach Music Group. Elektra was reactivated as a brand of Atlantic Records Group in 2009. The same year Atlantic's dance and hip hop imprint Big Beat Records, which scored notable success for most of the 1990s (but had been in hibernation since 1998) was also relaunched.\nOn June 18, 2018,  Warner Music Group announced the formation of Elektra Music Group to be launched as a stand-alone, independently managed primary label at WMG on October 1.  Splitting off from Atlantic Records Group, EMG will take with it five labels that previously operated under the Atlantic group (including Elektra Records), three label staff, and a handful of major artists. Elektra's independence renews the WEA (Warner-Elektra-Atlantic) triad that had for decades mark the original company organization. Elektra co-presidents, however, will answer to Atlantic Records Group Chairman/CEO Craig Kallman and Chairman/COO Julie Greenwald.\nIn 2020, Atlantic Records announced the relaunching of its original subsidiary label Atco Records, under the authority of its A&R President Pete Ganbarg. This reactivation of Atco Records marks the first time in over 25 years that the label has actively operated under the Atlantic Records umbrella.\n\n\n== Labels ==\nAvang Music\nAsylum Records\nAtco Records\nAtlantic Records\nBig Beat Records\nCustard Records\nFNC Entertainment\nHitmaker Records\nLaSalle Records\nMaybach Music Group\nOwsla\nUpFront Records\nX5 Music Group\nTaylor Gang Records\nGeneration Now\n10K Projects\n\n\n== Atlantic Records UK ==\n\nAtlantic Records UK is a British record label used as copyright-holder for UK releases on the Atlantic label.

Records, Maverick Records, Sire Records, Atlantic Records, Elektra Records and other Warner Music Group labels and to release them on video.\nIn 2006, Warner Music Vision merged with the Rights Company to form Warner Music Entertainment.\n\n\n== Labels ==\n\n\n=== WarnerVision Entertainment ===\nThe label also had a sublabel, WarnerVision Entertainment (formerly A*Vision Entertainment from 1990 until 1995), to release special interest products.\nThe A*Vision Entertainment label was set up in 1990 by Atlantic Records, and the first release was the documentary Banned in the U.S.A., a 2 Live Crew documentary video. It was expanded in 1991 when it partnered with Penthouse to distribute videocassettes under the Penthouse Video label. In 1992, A*Vision gradually expanded by signing a deal with VIEW Video, which A*Vision could co-distribute with the VIEW Video label.\nTwo other labels: KidVision, primarily focusing on children's videos, and NightVision, to release videos strictly at an adult audience, were set up by A*Vision as well, in January 1993. Also in 1993, Rhino Home Video, a division of Rhino Records, was signing a deal with A*Vision Entertainment, after its deal with Uni concludes. Also that year, BodyVision was launched as an label of A*Vision Entertainment, designed to release health and fitness videos, and the first videos picked up by A*Vision were Kathy Smith workout videos, which were developed after Media Home Entertainment closed its doors.\nA*Vision Entertainment also launched a label dedicated to motion pictures, which is called Atlantic Group Films. The first film released under the label was the direct-to-video erotic thriller Indecent Behavior, which ranked No. 36 in the Billboard charts in its first week. In 1994, Saban Entertainment signed a deal with A*Vision Entertainment to release titles under the Saban Home Entertainment and Libra Home Entertainment labels. Also that year, the company had acquired The Maier Group, who had produced the hit video series Buns of Steel.\nLater on, on January 21, 1995, it was shifted from Atlantic Records to Warner Bros. Records, which was rebranded to WarnerVision Entertainment on March 1, 1995, with the accompanying film unit was renamed from Atlantic Group Films to WarnerVision Films to reflect the change. Shortly afterwards, Dualstar Video, the video imprint of the Olsen twins' Dualstar Entertainment Group was subsequently moved from BMG Kidz to WarnerVision through a new distribution pact.\nOn December 23, 1995, Time Warner is planning on to spinoff its WarnerVision line to president Stuart Hersch, who is planning on to change its name back to A*Vision Entertainment, which WEA could continue to distribute. The spinoff was then nullified in 1996, with distribution shifting to Warner Home Video. While the Dualstar Video deal continued on under Warner Home Video, the Saban Entertainment deal didn't, with the company switching distributors to 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in October of that year.\n\n\n=== Warner Reprise Video ===\n\nThe company also has another notable sublabel, Warner Reprise Video (formerly Warner Music Video from 1984 until 1986), which was in operation, focusing on music video releases.\nThe company was initially set up in 1984 as Warner Music Video by WEA as a label to distribute the Warner Bros. Records catalog. It initially kicked off with a 20-minute compilation of Madonna's most recent hits. In 1986, Warner Music Video was then renamed to Warner Reprise Video, in order to add more music titles.\n\n\n=== Elektra Entertainment ===\nThe company also had another sublabel, that of Elektra Entertainment, which is operated by Elektra Records, that was established in 1986 to release the music video catalog of its Elektra Records label.\n\n\n=== WEA Music Video ===\nThe company operated WEA Video (lat\nSony Music Entertainment India Pvt.

Records and record executive Irving Azoff. Currently, this name is used as a Swedish label owned by Warner Music Sweden, a Swedish branch of Warner Music Group.\nIn 1990, Giant became a subsidiary label for Warner Music Group. Its first release, in early 1991, was the Gulf War all-star tribute song \"Voices That Care,\" assembled by producer David Foster. That spring, \"Hold You Tight\" by Tara Kemp was released and went on to become a Top 5 single. In the months that followed, Giant Records released the soundtrack album for the film New Jack City, selling 16 million copies worldwide. The label signed such acts as MC Hammer, Jade, Lord Finesse, and teen pop star Jeremy Jordan. Giant also signed established acts such as Steely Dan, Warren Zevon, Oingo Boingo, Chicago, Deep Purple, Morbid Angel, Brian Wilson, and Kenny Rogers. The label also operated a country music division in Nashville; the first act signed was Dennis Robbins.\nIn 1992, Irving Azoff expanded the Giant brand into film production. Giant Pictures only produced one film, The Inkwell, in 1994, before shutting down a year later.\nIn 1993, Giant became dissatisfied with Warner Music Group's practice of international affairs, so it made a deal with BMG to distribute its recordings outside the U.S. By the mid- to late 1990s, the company had replaced most of its staff and launched a subsidiary label called Revolution Records; Brian Wilson signed with the new label in 1997.\nThe company later reverted to its original name and distributed Paladin Records, which included singer-songwriter Steve Forbert. In 2001, Warner Music Group ended its joint venture with Giant, which was absorbed into Warner Bros. Records. Since then, BMG no longer repressed and distributed any previous releases of Giant. Distribution of current reissues are done by Warner Music's reissue division, Rhino, in conjunction with Warner Records, and many reissues still include Giant logo on packaging.\nIn February 2015, Warner Music Sweden announced that it would reactivate Giant's name; the first single released under the new Giant Records banner was Simon Erics' \"Waiting for the Sun.\"\nOn June 9, 2022, Azoff relaunched a rebranded and independent version of the label with no connections to Warner called Giant Music.  \n\n\n== Giant Records recording artists ==\nArtists on Giant Records were primarily distributed by Warner Bros.

Entertainment Inc. (commonly known as Warner Bros., or abbreviated as WB, or WBEI) is an American film and entertainment studio headquartered at the Warner Bros. Studios complex in Burbank, California, and a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). Founded in 1923 by four brothers, Harry, Albert, Sam, and Jack Warner, the company established itself as a leader in the American film industry before diversifying into animation, television, and video games, and is one of the \"Big Five\" major American film studios, as well as a member of the Motion Picture Association (MPA).\nThe company is known for its film studio division, the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, which includes Warner Bros. Pictures, New Line Cinema, Warner Bros. Pictures Animation, Castle Rock Entertainment, DC Studios, and the Warner Bros. Television Group. Bugs Bunny, a character created for the Looney Tunes series, is the company's official mascot.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\nThe company's name originated from the founding Warner brothers (born Wonsal, Woron, and Wonskolaser before Anglicization): Harry, Albert, Sam, and Jack Warner. Harry, Albert and Sam emigrated as young children with their Polish-Jewish mother to the United States from Krasnosielc, Poland (then part of Congress Poland within the Russian Empire), in October 1889, a year after their father emigrated to the U.S. and settled in Baltimore, Maryland. As in many other immigrant families, the elder Wonsal children gradually acquired anglicized versions of their Yiddish-sounding names: Szmuel Wonsal became Samuel Warner (nicknamed \"Sam\"), Hirsz Wonsal became Harry Warner, and Aaron Wonsal (although born with a given name common in the Americas) became Albert Warner. Jack, the youngest brother, was born in London, Ontario, during the family's two-year residency in Canada.\n\nThe three elder brothers began in the movie theater business, having acquired a movie projector with which they showed films in the mining towns of Pennsylvania and Ohio. In the beginning, Sam and Albert Warner invested $150 to present Life of an American Fireman and The Great Train Robbery. They opened their first theater, the Cascade, in New Castle, Pennsylvania, in 1903. When the original building was in danger of being demolished, the modern Warner Bros. called the current building owners and arranged to save it. The owners noted people across the country had asked them to protect it for its historical significance.\nIn 1904, the Warners founded the Pittsburgh-based Duquesne Amusement & Supply Company, to distribute films. In 1912, Harry Warner hired an auditor named Paul Ashley Chase. By the time of World War I, they had begun producing films; in the early 1920s they acquired their first studio facilities on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. Sam and Jack produced the pictures, while Harry and Albert, along with their auditor and now-controller Chase, handled finance and distribution in New York City. During World War I their first nationally syndicated film, My Four Years in Germany, based on a popular book by former ambassador James W. Gerard, was released. On April 4, 1923, with help from money loaned to Harry by his banker Motley Flint, they formally incorporated as Warner Bros. Pictures, Incorporated. (As late as the 1960s, Warner Bros. claimed 1905 as its founding date.)\n\nThe first important deal was the acquisition of the rights to Avery Hopwood's 1919 Broadway play, The Gold Diggers, from theatrical impresario David Belasco. However, Rin Tin Tin, a dog brought from France after World War I by an American soldier, established their reputation. Rin Tin Tin's third film was the feature Where the North Begins, which was so successful that Jack signed the dog to star in more films for $1,000 per week. Rin Tin Tin became the studio's top star. Jack nicknamed him \"The Mortgage Lifter\" and the success boosted Darryl F. Zanuck's career. Zanuck eventually became a top producer and between 1928 and 1933 served a\nEMI Group Limited (formerly EMI Group plc until 2007; originally an initialism for Electric and Musical Industries, also referred to as EMI Records or simply EMI) was a British transnational conglomerate founded in March 1931 in London. At the time of its acquisition by Universal Music in 2012, it was the fourth largest business group and record label conglomerate in the music industry, and was one of the \"Big Four\" record companies (now the \"Big Three\"). Its labels included EMI Records, Parlophone, Virgin Records, and Capitol Records, which are now referenced under Universal Music due to their acquisition with the exception of Parlophone, as it is now owned by Warner Music.\nEMI was listed on the London Stock Exchange, and was also once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index, but faced financial problems and US$4 billion in debt, leading to its acquisition by Citigroup in February 2011. Citigroup's ownership was temporary, as EMI announced in November 2011 that it would sell its music arm to Vivendi's Universal Music Group for $1.9 billion and its publishing business to a Sony/ATV consortium for around $2.2 billion. Other members of the Sony consortium include the estate of Michael Jackson, the Blackstone Group, and the Abu Dhabi–owned Mubadala Development Company. EMI's locations in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada were all disassembled to repay debt, but the primary head office located outside those countries is still functional.\nEMI Music Publishing is now owned by Sony Music Publishing, the music publishing division of Sony Music which bought another 70% stake in EMI Music Publishing.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nElectric and Musical Industries Ltd was formed in March 1931 by the merger of the Columbia Graphophone Company and the Gramophone Company, with its \"His Master's Voice\" record label, firms that have a history extending back to the origins of recorded sound. The new vertically integrated company produced sound recordings as well as recording and playback equipment.\nThe company's gramophone manufacturing led to 40 years of success with larger-scale electronics and electrical engineering.\nIn October 1979, EMI merged with Thorn Electrical Industries to create Thorn EMI.\nOn 16 August 1996, Thorn EMI shareholders voted in favour of demerging Thorn from EMI again: the company became EMI Group plc, and the electronics and rentals divisions were divested as Thorn plc.\nThe company broke up in 2012.\n\n\n== Electronics research and development ==\n\n\n=== Television ===\nIn 1934, an EMI research team led by Sir Isaac Shoenberg developed the electronic Marconi-EMI system for television broadcasting, which quickly replaced Baird's electro-mechanical system following its introduction in 1936. After the Second World War, EMI resumed its involvement in making broadcasting equipment, notably providing the BBC's second television transmitter at Sutton Coldfield. It also manufactured broadcast television cameras for British television production companies as well as for the BBC. The commercial television ITV companies also used them alongside cameras made by Pye and Marconi. Their best-remembered piece of broadcast television equipment was the EMI 2001 colour television camera, which became the mainstay of much of the British television industry from the end of the 1960s until the early 1990s. Exports of this piece of equipment were low, however, and EMI left this area of product manufacture.\n\n\n=== Blumlein and radar ===\nEMI engineer Alan Blumlein received a patent for the invention of stereophonic sound in 1931. He was killed in 1942 whilst conducting flight trials on an experimental H2S radar set.\nDuring and after World War II, the EMI Laboratories in Hayes, Hillingdon developed radar equipment (including the receiver section of the British Army's GL-II anti-aircraft fire-control radar), microwave devices such as the reflex klystron oscillator (having played a crucial role in the development of early production types following on from ",

This acquisition brought Neil Young into the company fold, initially as a member of Buffalo Springfield. Young became one of Warner's longest-established artists, recording both as a solo artist and with groups under the Warner-owned Atlantic, Atco, and Reprise labels. Young also recorded five albums for Geffen Records during that label's period of Warner distribution. The Geffen catalogue, now owned by Universal Music Group, represents Young's only major recordings not under WMG ownership."

The purchase brought in Atlantic's lucrative back catalogue, which included classic recordings by Ray Charles, the Drifters, the Coasters, and many more.

King, and Aretha Franklin. Ultimately, the sale led to Stax leaving Atlantic because Seven Arts Productions insisted on keeping the rights to Stax recordings. Atlantic moved decisively into rock and pop in the late 1960s and 1970s, signing major British and American acts including Led Zeppelin, Cream, Crosby Stills & Nash, Yes, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Genesis, Average White Band, Dr. John, King Crimson, Bette Midler, Roxy Music, and Foreigner."

The company was then based in Riley Street, Darlinghurst, and had three major labels: Warner Bros. Records, Elektra Records, and Atlantic Records\nA year later Warner Bros. Records worldwide (including Australia) changed its name to Kinney Music. The monopoly laws in America at the time did not allow the three labels to trade as one, so the umbrella name of Kinney Music was chosen. For the first two years, the Australian Record Company (ARC), now known as Sony Music, handled the Australian distribution."

It also manufactured broadcast television cameras for British television production companies as well as for the BBC. The commercial television ITV companies also used them alongside cameras made by Pye and Marconi. Their best-remembered piece of broadcast television equipment was the EMI 2001 colour television camera, which became the mainstay of much of the British television industry from the end of the 1960s until the early 1990s.

The original band existed from 1970 to 1974 but their recordings were not released until 1976 or later. It featured Richman and bassist Ernie Brooks with drummer David Robinson (later of The Cars) and keyboardist Jerry Harrison (later of Talking Heads). The sound of the band owed a great deal to the influence of the Velvet Underground and the Stooges, and is now sometimes classified as \"proto-punk\". It pointed the way towards much of the punk rock, new wave, alternative and indie rock music of later decades. Their only album, the eponymous The Modern Lovers, contained idiosyncratic songs about dating awkwardness, growing up in Massachusetts, love of life, and the USA.\nLater, between 1976 and 1988, Richman used the name Modern Lovers for a variety of backing bands, always billed as \"Jonathan Richman and The Modern Lovers\". These bands were quieter and featured more low-key, often near-childlike songs as Richman drew on folk-rock and other genres. Of Richman's original bandmates, only Robinson was part of any of the other Modern Lovers incarnations.\n\n\n== The original Modern Lovers, 1970–1974 ==\nRichman grew up in Natick, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, and began playing guitar and writing songs in his mid-teens, first performing solo in public in 1967. He became enamored of the Velvet Underground while he was still in high school, and after graduating in 1969, he moved to New York City where he became personally acquainted with the band and on one occasion opened the bill for them. Richman spent a couple of weeks sleeping on Velvets’ manager Steve Sesnick's sofa before moving into the Hotel Albert, a residence known for its poor conditions.\nAfter nine months in New York, and a trip to Europe and Israel, Richman moved back to his native Boston. With his childhood friend, guitarist John Felice, he organized a band modeled after the Velvets. They quickly recruited drummer David Robinson and bass player Rolfe Anderson, and christened themselves \"The Modern Lovers\". They played their first date, supporting Andy Paley’s band the Sidewinders, in September 1970, barely a month after Richman's return. By this time their setlist already included such noted Richman songs as \"Roadrunner\", \"She Cracked\" and \"Hospital\". Richman's unique character was immediately apparent; he wore short hair and often performed wearing a jacket and tie, and frequently improvised new lyrics and monologues.\nIn early 1971 Anderson and Felice departed; they were replaced by Harvard students bassist Ernie Brooks, and keyboardist Jerry Harrison, completing the classic lineup of the Modern Lovers. This new configuration became very popular in the Boston area, and by the fall of 1971, enthusiastic word-of-mouth led to the Modern Lovers' first exposure to a major label when Stuart Love of Warner Bros. Records contacted them and organized the band's first multi-track session at Intermedia Studio in Boston. The demo produced from this session, and the group's live performances, generated more attention from the industry, including rave reviews from critic Lillian Roxon, and soon A&M Records was interested in the band as well.\nIn April 1972, the Modern Lovers traveled to Los Angeles where they held two demo sessions: the first was produced by the Velvet Underground's John Cale for Warner Bros. while the second was produced by Allan Mason for A&M. These sessions were later used on the band's debut album. While in California the band also performed live, and one gig at the Long Branch Saloon in Berkeley was later issued as a live album. Producer Kim Fowley courted the band, traveling to Boston to produce some poor-quality demos in June 1972. Felice rejoined the group for a few months after his graduation, and the band moved together to live in Cohasset, Massachusetts.\nThe Modern Lovers continued to be a popular live attraction, and on New Year's Eve 1972 supported the New York Do\n\"Edge of Seventeen\" is a song by the American singer-songwriter Stevie Nicks from her debut solo studio album Bella Donna (1981), released as the third single from the album on February 4, 1982. The lyrics were written by Nicks to express the grief resulting from the death of her uncle Jonathan and the murder of John Lennon during the same week of December 1980. The song features a distinctive, chugging 16th-note guitar riff, drum beat and a simple chord structure typical of Nicks' songs. The song's title for the single release was \"Edge of Seventeen (Just Like the White Winged Dove)\". In the United States, \"Edge of Seventeen\" just missed out on the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 11. Despite this, it became one of Nicks' most enduring and recognizable songs and has been covered by several artists. In 2021, it was ranked No. 217 on Rolling Stone's list of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".\n\n\n== Background and inspiration ==\nAccording to Nicks, the title came from a conversation she had with Tom Petty's first wife, Jane, about the couple's first meeting. Jane said they met \"at the age of seventeen\", but Jane's strong Southern accent made it sound like \"edge of seventeen\" to Nicks. She liked the sound of the phrase so much that she told Jane she would write a song for it and give her credit for the inspiration.\nAlthough Nicks had originally planned to use the title for a song about Tom and Jane Petty, the death of her uncle Jonathan and the murder of John Lennon during the same week of December 1980 inspired a new song for which Nicks used the title. Nicks' producer and lover Jimmy Iovine was a close friend of Lennon, and Nicks felt helpless to comfort him. Soon after, Nicks flew home to Phoenix, Arizona, to be with her uncle Jonathan, who was dying of cancer. She remained with her uncle and his family until his death.\nNicks had never actually heard a dove's call before, as she revealed in 2020 when she had only just heard it recently. The opening lyrics were inspired by a menu she was reading at a Phoenix restaurant in 1980, which said, \"The white wing dove sings a song that sounds like she’s singing ooh, ooh, ooh. She makes her home here in the great Saguaro cactus that provides shelter and protection for her…\".\n\n\n== Composition and lyrics ==\nAs is typical of Nicks' songs, the lyrics are highly symbolic. Nicks has said that the white-winged dove represents the spirit leaving the body on death, and some of the verses capture her experience of the days leading up to her uncle Jonathan's death.\n\nThroughout the song, a distinctive 16th note guitar riff is played by Waddy Wachtel, progressing through C, D, and E-minor chords. During the bridge, the chords alternate twice between E-minor and C. Nicks's backing band recommended that they emulate The Police's \"Bring On the Night\" for the guitar riff, although Wachtel was unfamiliar with the song.\"I had never heard \"Bring On the Night,\" and at that session they told me they were going to do this song based on this feel. I had heard something about the Police, but I didn't know what they were talking about. Then about two years ago, I had the radio on, and on comes what sounds like \"Edge of Seventeen\" – and all of a sudden, there's Sting's voice! I thought, 'We ripped them off completely!' I called Stevie that night and said, 'Listen to me, don't ever do that again!'\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRecord World praised the song for its \"powerful lyrics, a percolating rhythm section and Stevie's throaty vocal.\" Author Zoe Howe has described the song as being about \"transforming and elevating the feelings of grief and soaring above them with strength\" and being \"a perfect combination of tough rock 'n' roll grit, raw emotion and full-beam, strut-about-in-platform-boots rock queen glamour.\"\nThe song is a favourite among Nicks' fanbase.\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\n\"Edge of Seventeen\" peaked at No. 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks in April 1982. The live version on the B-side \n\"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\" is a song recorded by Stevie Nicks and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and released as the first single from Nicks' debut solo album Bella Donna (1981). The track is the album's only song that was neither written nor co-written by Nicks. Written by Tom Petty and Mike Campbell as a Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers song, Jimmy Iovine, who was also working for Stevie Nicks at the time, arranged for her to sing on it. Petty sings with Nicks in the chorus and bridge, while his entire band provides instrumentation with the exception of Ron Blair, who was replaced by bassist Donald \"Duck\" Dunn for the recording.\nA performance of the song in the studio was used as the promotional video. The video was the 25th video to be played on MTV's launch date on August 1, 1981. Petty and Nicks also sang together on the songs \"Insider\" (from Petty's album Hard Promises (1981)) and \"I Will Run to You\" (from Nicks's album The Wild Heart (1983)), and frequently performed impromptu live versions of these and 1960s classic \"Needles and Pins\" in many shows through the 1980s.\nAs of 2017, \"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\" remains a mainstay of Stevie Nicks's solo performances, and on July 9, 2017, Nicks performed the song together with Petty and the Heartbreakers at the British Summer Time festival at Hyde Park in London, in what turned out to be their final performance of the song together before Petty's death in October 2017.\nThe song peaked at No. 3 on the American Billboard Hot 100 for six consecutive weeks, (Nicks's biggest solo hit and the Heartbreakers' biggest hit as well). However, in the United Kingdom, the song only managed to peak at No. 50 on the UK Singles Chart. \n\n\n== Content ==\nIn a November 2003 interview with Songfacts, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers guitarist and primary songwriter Mike Campbell explained the song's origins:\n\n\"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\" was a song that I had written the music and Tom had written the words. The Heartbreakers had recorded a version of it with Jimmy Iovine, and Jimmy being the entrepreneur that he was, he was working with Stevie, and I guess he asked Tom if she could try it, and it just developed from there.\nWe cut the track as a Heartbreakers record and when she decided to do it we used that track and she came in and sang over it. It became a duet. It's basically all the Heartbreakers on that record.\nThe lyrics are about a woman who feels weighed down by relationships and wants to part despite a strong sentimental attachment to her lover. The melody is described by AllMusic as \"dark and sinister\". Apart from the intro before the first verse and a solo following the second verse (where there is some fairly heavy riffing), however, the guitar sound is laid-back in typical Heartbreakers style. The song was originally recorded for Petty's album Hard Promises, but the producers felt the song came from a female point of view and it was left unreleased until it was agreed to be put on the Bella Donna album instead. A demo version of the song, recorded without Nicks, was eventually released on Petty's boxed set Playback (1995).\nBillboard called it a \"punchy uptempo piece of rock.\"  Record World said that \"Nicks' uncompromising vocal pairs perfectly with Petty.\"\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nBand\n\nStevie Nicks – lead vocals\nLori Perry – backing vocals\nSharon Celani – backing vocals\nTom Petty – co-lead vocals, guitar\nMichael Campbell – lead guitar\nBenmont Tench – organ\nStan Lynch – drums\nAdditional musicians \n\nDonald \"Duck\" Dunn – bass guitar\nPhil Jones – percussion\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Cover versions ==\nThe song was parodied by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic as \"Stop Draggin' My Car Around\" on his debut album \"Weird Al\" Yankovic (1983).\nJimmy Fallon and Stevie Nicks performed the song in a humorous recreation of the 1981 music video on The Tonight Show on April 9, 2014.\n\n\n== References ==\nThe 1980 Summer Olympics (Russian: Летние Олимпийские игры 1980, romanized: Letnije Olimpijskije igry 1980), officially known as the Games of the XXII Olympiad (Russian: Игры XXII Олимпиады, romanized: Igry XXII Olimpiady) and officially branded as Moscow 1980 (Russian: Москва 1980), were an international multi-sport event held from 19 July to 3 August 1980 in Moscow, Soviet Union, in present-day Russia. The games were the first to be staged in an Eastern Bloc country, as well as the first Olympic Games and only Summer Olympics to be held in a Slavic language-speaking country. They were also the only Summer Olympic Games to be held in a self-proclaimed communist country until the 2008 Summer Olympics held in China. These were the final Olympic Games under the IOC Presidency of Michael Morris, 3rd Baron Killanin before he was succeeded by Juan Antonio Samaranch, a Spaniard, shortly afterward.\nEighty nations were represented at the Moscow Games, the smallest number since 1956. Led by the United States, 66 countries boycotted the games entirely, because of the Soviet–Afghan War. Several alternative events were held outside of the Soviet Union. Some athletes from some of the boycotting countries (not included in the list of 66 countries that boycotted the games entirely) participated in the games under the Olympic Flag. The Soviet Union later boycotted the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The Soviet Union won the most gold and overall medals, with the USSR and East Germany winning 127 out of 203 available golds.\n\n\n== Host city selection ==\n\nThe only two cities to bid for the 1980 Summer Olympics were Moscow and Los Angeles. The choice between them was made at the 75th IOC Session in Vienna, Austria on 23 October 1974. Los Angeles would eventually host the 1984 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n== Participation and boycott ==\n\nEighty nations were represented at the Moscow Olympics, the smallest number since 1956. Of the eighty participating nations, seven National Olympic Committees made their first appearance at these Games: Angola, Botswana, Cyprus, Jordan, Laos, Mozambique and Seychelles. It was also the first time Vietnam participated after the end of the Vietnam War and the Reunification of Vietnam. None of these nations won a medal.\n29 countries boycotted the previous 1976 Summer Olympics in protest against the IOC for not expelling New Zealand, which had sanctioned a rugby tour of apartheid South Africa. The 1980 Summer Olympics were disrupted by another, even larger, boycott led by the United States in protest of the 1979 Soviet–Afghan War. The Soviet invasion spurred President Jimmy Carter to issue an ultimatum on 20 January 1980, which stated that the U.S. would boycott the Moscow Olympics if Soviet troops did not withdraw from Afghanistan within one month. 66 countries and regions invited did not participate in the 1980 Olympics. Many of these followed the United States' boycott initiative, while others cited economic reasons for not participating. Iran, under Ayatollah Khomeini hostile to both superpowers, boycotted when the Islamic Conference condemned the invasion. Neither the People's Republic of China nor Taiwan (Republic of China) participated in the games, the former as a consequence of the Sino-Soviet split.\nMany of the boycotting nations participated instead in the Liberty Bell Classic, also known as the \"Olympic Boycott Games\", in Philadelphia. Those that competed had won 71 percent of all medals and gold medals at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. This was in part due to state-run doping programs that had been developed in the Eastern Bloc countries. As a form of protest against the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, fifteen countries marched in the Opening Ceremony with the Olympic Flag instead of their national flags, and the Olympic Flag and Olympic Hymn were used at medal ceremonies when athletes from these countries won medals. Competitors from New Zealand, Portugal, and Spain competed under the flags of their \nThe Other Side of the Mirror is the fourth solo studio album by American singer and songwriter Stevie Nicks. Released on May 30, 1989, through the Modern Records label, the album was recorded in California, New York, and Buckinghamshire in England, and is loosely based around the theme of Lewis Carroll's novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865).\nThe album was a commercial success. It reached No. 10 on the US Billboard 200, propelled by the hit single \"Rooms on Fire\" (US No. 16), and achieved Platinum status for selling in excess of one million copies. The album reached No. 3 in the United Kingdom and was certified Gold there for sales in excess of 100,000. The Other Side of the Mirror is Nicks' highest charting album to date in various European countries including Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the huge success of Fleetwood Mac's album Tango in the Night (1987) in the United Kingdom, The Other Side of the Mirror became Nicks' highest-charting solo album there, reaching No. 3 and spawning her first UK Top 40 hit with \"Rooms on Fire\" (reaching No. 16), which Nicks performed on the BBC show Top of the Pops. The album was certified gold in the United Kingdom for sales in excess of 100,000 copies. Her first, and so far only, solo tour of the United Kingdom and Europe (including Sweden, France and the Netherlands), followed the album. There was also a US tour, though Nicks has famously since commented that she has no recollection of the tours due to her increasing dependency on the prescribed tranquilizer Klonopin at that time.\nIn the United States, \"Two Kinds of Love\" was released as a single, featuring vocals by Bruce Hornsby and an instrumental interlude by Kenny G, which became Nicks' first single to fail to chart, missing both the Billboard and Cash Box charts. However, \"Long Way to Go\" gained substantial airplay, making Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart, and it also made the Top 75 on the UK Singles Chart, as did \"Whole Lotta Trouble\". Promotional music videos were shot for \"Rooms on Fire\" and \"Whole Lotta Trouble\". The former was released with two slightly different edits, while the \"Whole Lotta Trouble\" video was shot during the American leg of Nicks' tour at the Summit Arena in Houston, Texas.\nAn earlier, instrumental version of the song \"Juliet\" (titled \"Book of Miracles\") was released by Fleetwood Mac in 1987 as the B-side to \"Seven Wonders\", while “Ooh My Love” was demoed for Tango in the Night but was ultimately shelved. The song \"Cry Wolf\" was originally recorded by American singer Laura Branigan for her fifth studio album Touch (1987).\nModern Records also released a special long-form interview video on the making of the album, titled \"Reflections from the Other Side of the Mirror\", which contained newly filmed material shot by Herbert Worthington III. However, it was limited to a worldwide release of 10,000 albums and only 500 VHS releases.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nDuncan Holland, reviewer of British music newspaper Music Week, praised the album. He wrote: \"This is a remarkably strong record from the single, \"Rooms on Fire\", to the 11 other tracks on show. Some rather overworked \"Alice in Wonderland\" imagery aside, this is excellent stuff, floating, melodic, twisting and turning.\" Pete Clark of Hi-Fi News & Record Review also found some warm words. He considered that this work is destined \"for those evenings when you just have to leave your brain at the door, there are worse things that can ooze into your ears.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMusicians\n\nStevie Nicks – vocals, percussion (1, 6), tambourine (2, 4, 5, 7, 10)\nRupert Hine – keyboards, percussion (1, 3, 4, 6), drum programming (3, 9, 11, 12), synth bass (9), bass (12)\nRick Nowels – guitars (1, 2, 4), acoustic guitar (1)\nJamie West-Oram – guitars (1-4, 6, 8, 9, 11)\nWaddy Wachtel – acoustic guitar (3, 7, 9, 12), guitars (6, 7, 10)\nMike Campbell – guitars (5, 6, 7), slide acoustic guitar \nAsha Bhosle is an Indian playback singer who has been cited by the Guinness Book of World Records as the most recorded singer in history.\n\n\n== 1940s ==\n\n\n=== 1948 ===\n\n\n=== 1949 ===\n\n\n== 1950s ==\n\n\n=== 1950 ===\n\n\n=== 1951 ===\n\n\n=== 1952 ===\n\n\n=== 1953 ===\n\n\n=== 1954 ===\n\n\n=== 1955 ===\n\n\n=== 1956 ===\n\n\n=== 1957 ===\n\n\n=== 1958 ===\n\n\n=== 1959 ===\n\n\n== 1960s ==\n\n\n=== 1960 ===\n\n\n=== 1961 ===\n\n\n=== 1962 ===\n\n\n=== 1963 ===\n\n\n=== 1964 ===\n\n\n=== 1965 ===\n\n\n=== 1966 ===\n\n\n=== 1967 ===\n\n\n=== 1968 ===\n\n\n=== 1969 ===\n\n\n== 1970s ==\n\n\n=== 1970 ===\n\n\n=== 1971 ===\n\n\n=== 1972 ===\n\n\n=== 1973 ===\n\n\n=== 1974 ===\n\n\n=== 1975 ===\n\n\n=== 1976 ===\n\n\n=== 1977 ===\n\n\n=== 1978 ===\n\n\n=== 1979 ===\n\n\n== 1980s ==\n\n\n=== 1980 ===\n\n\n=== 1981 ===\n\n\n=== 1982 ===\n\n\n=== 1983 ===\n\n\n=== 1984 ===\n\n\n=== 1985 ===\n\n\n=== 1986 ===\n\n\n=== 1987 ===\n\n\n=== 1988 ===\n\n\n=== 1989 ===\n\n\n== 1990s ==\n\n\n=== 1990 ===\n\n\n=== 1991 ===\n\n\n=== 1992 ===\n\n\n=== 1993 ===\n\n\n=== 1994 ===\n\n\n=== 1995 ===\n\n\n=== 1996 ===\n\n\n=== 1997 ===\n\n\n=== 1998 ===\n\n\n=== 1999 ===\n\n\n== 2000s ==\n\n\n=== 2000 ===\n\n\n=== 2001 ===\n\n\n=== 2002 ===\n\n\n=== 2003 ===\n\n\n=== 2004 ===\n\n\n=== 2005 ===\n\n\n=== 2006 ===\n\n\n=== 2007 ===\n\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\n\n== 2010s ==\n\n\n== Hindi non-film songs ==\n\n\n=== Hindi TV serial songs ===\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nPremchand, Manek (27 December 2018).

Written by Nicks and Rick Nowels, and produced by Rupert Hine, the song was released on April 24, 1989, by the Modern label, as the lead single from The Other Side of the Mirror. The 12-inch single was released in a limited-edition poster sleeve in certain territories.\n\"Rooms on Fire\" was successful on both sides of the Atlantic, reaching number 16 on the UK Singles Chart and on the US Billboard Hot 100 while topping the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. In the United Kingdom, it was Nicks' first solo top-forty hit and is her highest-charting song to date. The single was also highly successful in Canada and New Zealand, reaching numbers nine and 12 respectively.\nIn the accompanying music video for \"Rooms on Fire\", Nicks is seen holding a baby dressed in white, played by her goddaughter. \"Rooms on Fire\" was performed sporadically at Nicks' live concerts up until New Year's Eve of 1999, though it has yet to be played live since then. Nearly 30 years after original release, Nicks planned to sing \"Rooms on Fire\" on the 24 Karat Gold Tour, but the song was cut from the setlist.\n\n\n== Background and composition ==\nIn a 1989 interview, Nicks gave personal insight as to the meaning of \"Rooms on Fire\":\n\n\"Rooms on Fire is about a girl who goes through a life like I have gone through, where she finally accepts the idea that there never will be those other things in her life. She will never be married, she will never have children, she will never do those [that] part of life.\"\nThe song, according to the liner notes of Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks, was inspired by Nicks's brief relationship with Rupert Hine.\n\n\"The night I met Rupert Hine was a dangerous one. He was different from anyone else I had ever known...He was older, and he was smarter, and we both knew it. I hired him to do the album before we even started talking about music. It seemed that we had made a spiritual agreement to do a magic album...in a fabulous Dutch castle, at the top of the mountain. We recorded it in the formal dining room...where, upon the walls hung all these very old and expensive pieces of art...looking at us...we were never alone.\"\n\n\"It always seemed to me that whenever Rupert walked into one of these old, dark castle rooms, that the rooms were on fire. There was a connection between us that everyone around us instantly picked up on, and everyone was very careful to respect our space...our TIMESPACE, so we all lived at the castle for about four-and-a-half months. I went home with him to England to mix the album at his studio...he left in December. I joined him there in London in January. We left immediately for his studio, Farmyard Studios, somewhere outside London. It was like being in a cottage in Wales, it was a little spooky...the atmosphere was like nothing I had ever experienced. Then something happened to him that simply made it impossible for us to ever be together again. I left him there...the rooms were still burning, but the fire had been stolen from us. It wasn't over love, in fact...it had nothing to do with love. It was just a bad situation. I came back to Los Angeles, a very changed woman. And now, long nets of white...cloud my memory...Now I remember the rooms, the music, and how truly magic the whole thing was...\"\n\n\n== Track listings ==\nUS 7-inch and cassette single\n\n\"Rooms on Fire\" (7-inch remix) – 4:32\n\"Alice\" – 5:50\nInternational 7-inch single and Japanese mini-CD single\n\n\"Rooms on Fire\" – 4:20 (4:26 in Japan)\n\"Alice\" – 5:46 (5:41 in Japan)\nUK 12-inch, CD, and cassette single\n\n\"Rooms on Fire\" – 8:56\n\"Alice\" – 5:46\n\"Has Anyone Ever Written Anything for You?\" (live version) – 5:00\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nStevie Nicks – lead vocals, percussion\nLori Perry Nicks – backing vocals\nSharon Celani – backing vocals\nRick Nowels – guitars\nJamie West-Oram – guitars\nVail Johnson – bass guitar\nRupert Hine – keyboa\nModern Method Records was a record label that helped to document the Boston hardcore scene in the early 1980s. Modern Method was an offshoot of the Newbury Comics music retailer and also the Boston Rock magazine. The label was located at 268 Newbury ST. in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nHansa Records (also known as Hansa, Hansa Musik Produktion or Hansa International) was a record label based in Berlin, Germany founded in 1962.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the early 1960s, brothers Peter and Thomas Meisel, grandchildren of Will Meisel, who was the founder of German music publisher Edition Meisel & Co. GmbH, assumed responsibility of the family's publishing company upon their grandfather's retirement, and founded Hansa Musik Produktion company and the Hansa record label in 1962. The label's name (and the name of the related recording studio) was inspired by the Hanseatic League, a medieval Northern European maritime trade network.\nInitially, the label focused on German artists and Schlager music, later finding commercial success with artists such as Frank Farian's Boney M., Amii Stewart, Aneka, Modern Talking, Milli Vanilli, and others.\nIn 1977, the label signed an early lineup of The Cure (known at that time as Easy Cure), but wasn't happy with the band's demos and refused to release \"Killing an Arab\", suggesting that the band record cover songs instead. The band refused, and Hansa dropped them.\nIn the mid-1980s, after a decline in sales both domestically and internationally, Hansa Records was eventually purchased by Bertelsmann Music Group, who merged them with several other labels like Ariola-Eurodisc to form BMG Berlin Musik GmbH/BMG-Ariola, later to become part of international conglomerate Sony Music Entertainment, under which it was phased-out in 2009. It is used today only for reissues of its previous releases.\n\n\n== Recording studios ==\n\nWhen it became difficult for Hansa to book sufficient recording studio time at the Ariola-Eurodisc studio to keep up with their growing production schedule, the Meisel brothers built Hansa Studio One in Tiergarten in West Berlin. In 1972, the Meisel brothers acquired Ariola's historic building at Köthener Strasse 38, home of the historic Meistersaal concert hall, naming it Hansa Tonstudio Two. Initially intended to record only Hansa Records projects, Hansa's studios gradually started booking non-Hansa clients, most notably Iggy Pop and David Bowie, who in 1977 recorded their respective albums Lust for Life and Low at the studio. In the late 1970s they closed the first studio and consolidated operations to the second, simplify referring to it as Hansa Tonstudio. The Meisel family retained ownership of Hansa Tonstudio, who run it as part of the Meisel Music group.\n\n\n== Selected list of Hansa label artists ==\n\n\n== Selected list of Hansa label releases (by year) ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of record labels\n\n\n== References ==\nThe Modern Lovers is the debut studio album by American rock band the Modern Lovers. It was released on Beserkley Records in 1976, though the original tracks had been recorded in 1971 and 1972. Six of the original tracks were produced by John Cale. \nThe album has been featured three times on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and was included in Robert Dimery's book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Modern Lovers were formed in 1970 by teenage singer, songwriter, and guitarist Jonathan Richman. In early 1971, the band's membership was settled as Richman, Jerry Harrison (keyboards), Ernie Brooks (bass) and David Robinson (drums), with Richman's friend and original band member John Felice joining them occasionally on second guitar as his educational commitments allowed. By the autumn of 1971, through their live performances in Boston and New York, they had begun to attract the attention of several record company A&R men, including Stuart Love at Warner Brothers, and Allan Mason and Matthew Kaufman at A&M. The band made their first recordings for Warner Brothers at the Intermedia Studios in Boston in late 1971; these included the version of \"Hospital\" which was later to feature on the album.\nIn April 1972, the Modern Lovers travelled to Los Angeles where they held two demo sessions; the first was produced for Warner Brothers by John Cale, formerly of the Velvet Underground, while the second was produced by Allan Mason and Robert Appère for A&M. Both sets of sessions yielded tracks which, although originally recorded as demos, eventually found their way onto the album. The Cale sessions produced \"Roadrunner\", \"Astral Plane\", \"Old World\", \"Pablo Picasso\", \"She Cracked\" and \"Someone I Care About\". The A&M sessions yielded \"Girl Friend\", \"Modern World\" and \"Dignified and Old\" (which, although not included on the original LP, was included on later CD reissues).\nHowever, the band were initially undecided over which record company to sign for, returned to Boston, and also did some recordings organised by Kim Fowley and produced by Stuart \"Dinky\" Dawson. Eventually, in early 1973, they signed with Warner Brothers and agreed that John Cale should produce their debut album. In the meantime, they undertook a short residency at a hotel in Bermuda. Returning to California in the summer to work with Cale, it became apparent both that there were personality clashes between some of the band members, and that Richman now wanted to take a different approach to his songs - much more mellow and easy-paced rather than the earlier aggressive hard rock. The sessions with Cale were terminated before any new recordings were completed. Warner Brothers then engaged Kim Fowley to work with the band, but by this time Richman refused to perform some of his most popular earlier songs live. The band were also affected by the death during the sessions of their friend Gram Parsons: on the day before Parsons' death, he and Richman had played miniature golf and discussed recording together. The sessions with Fowley were aborted, although two tracks, \"I'm Straight\" and the original recording of \"Government Center\", and possibly others, were later issued on CD versions of The Modern Lovers. Warner Brothers withdrew support from the band, and, early in 1974, the original Modern Lovers split up.\n\n\n== Release ==\nIn late 1974, Richman signed as a solo artist with Matthew \"King\" Kaufman's new label, \"Home of the Hits\", soon to be renamed Beserkley Records, and recorded four tracks with backing by the bands Earth Quake and The Rubinoos, including new versions of both \"Roadrunner\" and \"Government Center\". These tracks were first issued as singles, and then on an album Beserkley Chartbusters Vol.1 in 1975. In 1976, with a new line-up of the Modern Lovers, Richman began recording what he went on to regard as his debut album, Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers.\nHowever, in the meantime, Kaufman also put toge\nLinton Kwesi Johnson OD (born 24 August 1952), also known as LKJ, is a Jamaica-born, British-based dub poet and activist. In 2002, he became the second living poet, and the only black one, to be published in the Penguin Modern Classics series. His performance poetry involves the recitation of his own verse in Jamaican patois over dub-reggae, usually written in collaboration with reggae producer/artist Dennis Bovell.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJohnson was born in Chapelton, a small town in the rural parish of Clarendon, Jamaica. His middle name, \"Kwesi\", is a Ghanaian name that is given to boys who, like Johnson, are born on a Sunday. In 1963 he and his father came to live in Brixton, London, joining his mother, who had immigrated to Britain as part of the Windrush generation shortly before Jamaican independence in 1962. Johnson attended Tulse Hill School in Lambeth. While still at school he joined the British Black Panther Movement, helped to organise a poetry workshop within the movement, and developed his work with Rasta Love, a group of poets and drummers.\nJohnson studied sociology at Goldsmiths College in New Cross, London, graduating in 1973. Speaking in a 2018 interview about his start as a poet, he said: \"I began to write verse, not only because I liked it, but because it was a way of expressing the anger, the passion of the youth of my generation in terms of our struggle against racial oppression. Poetry was a cultural weapon in the black liberation struggle, so that's how it began.\" During the early to mid-1970s he was employed as the first paid library resources and education officer at the Keskidee Centre, where his poem Voices of the living and the dead was staged, produced by Jamaican novelist Lindsay Barrett, with music by the reggae group Rasta Love. Johnson has recalled: \"it was fantastic, you know, having written something and having it staged with actors and musicians. That was back in 1973 before I had a poem published anywhere. That was before anyone had ever heard of Linton Kwesi Johnson.\"\nJohnson wrote for New Musical Express, Melody Maker, and Black Music in the 1970s. As a freelancer for Virgin Records he wrote biographies for their reggae artists, sleeve notes and copy for adverts.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Poetry ===\n\nMost of Johnson's poetry is political, dealing mainly with the experiences of being an African-Caribbean in Britain: \"Writing was a political act and poetry was a cultural weapon...\", he told an interviewer in 2008. However, he has also written about other issues, such as British foreign policy and the death of anti-racist marcher Blair Peach. Johnson wrote \"Reggae fi Dada\" on the death of his father in 1982, blaming social conditions. His most celebrated poems were written during the government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The poems contain graphic accounts of the racist police brutality occurring at the time (cf. \"Sonny's Lettah\"). Johnson's poetry makes clever use of the unstandardised transcription of Jamaican patois.\nJohnson's poems first appeared in the journal Race Today, which published his first collection of poetry, Voices of the Living and the Dead, in 1974. Dread Beat An' Blood, his second collection, was published in 1975 by Bogle-L'Ouverture.\nA collection of his poems has been published as Mi Revalueshanary Fren by Penguin Modern Classics. Johnson is one of only three living poets to be published by Penguin Modern Classics.\n\n\n=== Essays ===\nJohnson's essays, spanning 50 years (1976-2021), are collected in the volume Time Come (Picador, 2023). As described by Colin Grant, \"The writing is often flinty and flecked with passion; taut and reasoned, but on the edge of fury. ...the grace and power of LKJ's writing are as necessary as ever.\" Reviewing it in the Sunday Times, Tomiwa Owolade concludes: \"this volume emphasises the fact that Johnson is a dedicated cultural critic rather than simply an activist who happens to write dub poetry.\"\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nJohnson's best-known albums in\n1980 (MCMLXXX) was a leap year starting on Tuesday of the Gregorian calendar, the 1980th year of the Common Era (CE) and Anno Domini (AD) designations, the 980th  year of the 2nd millennium, the 80th  year of the 20th century, and the  1st   year of the 1980s decade.  \n\n\n== Events ==\n\n\n=== January ===\n\nJanuary 4 – U.S. President Jimmy Carter proclaims a grain embargo against the USSR with the support of the European Commission.\nJanuary 6 – Global Positioning System time epoch begins at 00:00 UTC.\nJanuary 9 – In Saudi Arabia, 63 Islamist insurgents are beheaded for their part in the siege of the Great Mosque in Mecca in November 1979.\nJanuary 14 – Congress (I) party leader, Indira Gandhi returns to power as the Prime Minister of India.\nJanuary 20 – At least 200 people are killed when the Corralejas Bullring collapses at Sincelejo, Colombia.\nJanuary 21 – The London Gold Fixing hits its highest price ever of $843 per troy ounce ($2,249.50 in 2020 when adjusted for inflation).\nJanuary 22 – Andrei Sakharov, Soviet scientist and human rights activist, is arrested in Moscow.\nJanuary 26 – Israel and Egypt establish diplomatic relations.\nJanuary 27 – Canadian Caper: Six United States diplomats, posing as Canadians, manage to escape from Tehran, Iran, as they board a flight to Zürich, Switzerland, on Swissair.\nJanuary 31 – Burning of the Spanish Embassy in Guatemala: The Spanish Embassy in Guatemala is invaded and set on fire, killing 36 people.

The song was not a chart hit, but the video did receive airplay on MTV in the early 1980s.\nMoore's career spanned decades and included teaching himself to play guitar, writing the lyrics to 1,000 original songs, forming multiple bands, and even starring in a few film roles. Moore's bands performed at well-known Los Angeles clubs, including Whisky a Go Go, The Troubadour, and Starwood, and headlined alongside The Police, The Knack, and The Motels. His memoir, It's Not a Rumour, published in 2021, chronicles his unorthodox story of making it big in music and life without ever making any money.\n\n\n== Early life, career beginnings ==\nMoore was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and aside from his family's brief move to San Francisco, California in 1966/67, grew up in the Twin Cities area. \"I didn't have any friends and really didn't want any. I just sat in my room and played Beatles songs and wrote my own,\" he claims. At this point, he was known as Rick Moore.\nHis family moved back to Richfield, Minnesota at the start of Freddy's Junior year in high school, his third high school in as many years. Right before the family's move, Freddy and his cousin, Danny Wick, had started a band called The Royal Cumquats. Moore  graduated from Richfield, Minnesota High School in 1968. Fearful that he would be drafted to serve in the Vietnam War, he enrolled at the University of Minnesota to study Music Theory and Composition under composer Dominick Argento.\nAfter performances with his band An English Sky, Moore started performing as Skogie, c. 1970.\nThe name Skogie took hold in PE class his senior year when Moore purchased a used official school PE t-shirt that had the name \"Skogie\" written on it. Being new to the school, Moore's classmates took to calling him by the name on his shirt. It stuck and became part of the inspiration for Moore's third and most successful Minneapolis band, Skogie and the Flaming Pachucos. Later, the band name reverted to Skogie. Moore wore his Skogie PE shirt to every gig and soon, he was referred to as Skogie. The name \"Flaming Pachucos\" was a nod to Moore's favorite composer, Frank Zappa, and his deep appreciation of the Pachuco culture of East Los Angeles.\nAround this time, Moore was married from 1971 to 1980 to his first wife Lucy.\nSkogie released a single in June 1972 with the help of producer/manager David Zimmerman (Bob Dylan's brother), and self-released a follow-up album in 1974. Creem magazine later named Skogie one of the first power pop bands.\n\n\n== Move to Los Angeles ==\n\nIn 1976, after national touring and recording experience at three Minneapolis studios, Moore decided to head to Los Angeles along with his wife and the rest of the band. While undergoing some personnel changes, the band changed their name to The Kats, and Moore invented a new on-stage persona for the act—a cat named Freddy.\nThat persona was formed from Moore's desire to write a rock opera about \"a guy who was always on the wrong side of where he wanted to be. A domestic cat who longed to be an alley cat but was too scared. Not an underdog, but an undercut. An underKat.\" That's how Skogie became Freddy Moore and his band became The Kats, just like the \"cool cats\" of the 1950s. Moore took his on-stage persona very seriously and often pantomimed being a cat.\nThe Kats signed a recording contract with Infinity Records in 1979, and recorded an album with Tom Petty's production team. However, just as final mixes were being completed Infinity Records was dissolved by its parent company MCA Records. The album was never released, and the master tapes remain locked in the Shelter Studios vault.\nAlso in 1979, Moore (then 29) met 16-year-old Demi Guynes at a nightclub. Almost immediately, despite Moore's existing marriage, the two beca\nGuinness World Records, known from its inception in 1955 until 1999 as The Guinness Book of Records and in previous United States editions as The Guinness Book of World Records, is a British reference book published annually, listing world records both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world. Sir Hugh Beaver created the concept, and twin brothers Norris and Ross McWhirter co-founded the book in London in August 1955.\nThe first edition topped the bestseller list in the United Kingdom by Christmas 1955. The following year the book was launched internationally, and as of the 2025 edition, it is now in its 70th year of publication, published in 100 countries and 40 languages, and maintains over 53,000 records in its database.\nThe international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums. The popularity of the franchise has resulted in Guinness World Records becoming the primary international source for cataloguing and verification of a huge number of world records. The organisation employs record adjudicators to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records.\nFollowing a series of owners, the franchise has been owned by the Jim Pattison Group since 2008, with its headquarters moved to South Quay Plaza, Canary Wharf, London, in 2017. Since 2008, Guinness World Records has orientated its business model away from selling books, and towards creating new world records as publicity exercises for individuals and organisations, which has attracted criticism.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nOn 10 November 1951, Sir Hugh Beaver, then the managing director of the Guinness Breweries, went on a shooting party in the North Slob, by the River Slaney in County Wexford, Ireland. After missing a shot at a golden plover, he became involved in an argument over which was the fastest game bird in Europe, the golden plover or the red grouse (the plover is faster, but neither is the fastest game bird in Europe). That evening at Castlebridge House, he realised that it was impossible to confirm in reference books whether or not the golden plover was Europe's fastest game bird. Beaver knew that there must have been numerous other questions debated nightly among the public, but there was no book in the world with which to settle arguments about records. He realised then that a book supplying the answers to this sort of question might prove successful. Beaver's idea became reality when Guinness employee Christopher Chataway recommended university friends Norris and Ross McWhirter, who had been running a fact-finding agency in London. The twin brothers were commissioned to compile what became The Guinness Book of (Superlatives and now) Records, in August 1954. A thousand copies were distributed for free to pubs across Britain and Ireland as a promotional asset for the Guinness brand, and they became immensely popular with customers.\nAfter the founding of The Guinness Book of Records office at the top of Ludgate House, 107 Fleet Street, London, the first 198-page edition was bound on 27 August 1955 and went to the top of the British bestseller list by Christmas. The following year, it was introduced into the United States by New York publisher David Boehm and sold 70,000 copies. Since then, Guinness World Records has sold more than 150 million copies in 100 countries and 40 languages.\n\nBecause the book became a surprise hit, many further editions were printed, eventually settling into a pattern of one revision a year, published in September/October, in time for Christmas. The McWhirters continued to compile it for many years. Both brothers had an encyclopedic memory; on the British children's television series Record Breakers, based upon the book, which was broadcast on the BBC from 1972 to 2001, they would take questions posed by children in the audience on various world records and were able to give the correct answer. Ross McWhirter was assassinated by two members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army \nThis is a list of career achievements by Wayne Gretzky in the National Hockey League (NHL). Upon his retirement on April 18, 1999, he was credited by the NHL Record Book with holding or sharing 61 NHL records, including 40 regular season, 15 playoff and 6 All-Star records. As of today, 24 seasons after retirement, he still holds or shares 57 of those NHL records.\nWinning four Stanley Cups (1984, 1985, 1987 ,1988), Gretzky set records in both regular season and post-season play, holding the record for most career regular season goals (894), assists (1,963), points (2,857) and hat-tricks (50). The next closest player in total points for the regular season is Jaromir Jagr at 1,921, thus he had more career assists than any other player has total points. \nGretzky scored his first 1,000 points faster (424 games) than any other player in NHL history, and scored the second 1,000 faster (433 games) than any player other than himself. His point total including regular season and playoffs stands at an imposing 3,239 (1,016 goals, 2,223 assists).\nGretzky still maintains the record for the most career playoff goals (122), assists (260), points (382), hat-tricks (10) and game-winning goals (24).

Written by Chas Sandford, the song was released as the lead single from the album in October 1985, through Modern Records. The single became a big hit for Nicks, peaking at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for two weeks and peaking at number one on the Billboard Top Mainstream Rock Songs chart for two weeks in 1985.\n\n\n== Background and composition ==\nThe song was written by Chas Sandford, who co-wrote John Waite's 1984 hit \"Missing You\". Sandford also plays most of the instruments on \"Talk to Me\". The song was brought to Nicks' attention by producer Jimmy Iovine, \"who was always on the hunt for a hit song.\" Nicks said she didn't like the song at first because she had trouble with the vocals, but Iovine persisted and she eventually recorded it. Jim Keltner was in the studio next door doing some drum overdubs during the recording process. After Nicks explained her dilemma, Keltner gave her some words of encouragement and offered to stay with her and be her audience. Nicks sang the song twice during the session and then it was finished.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nCash Box called it \"a mid-tempo rocker which makes good uses of Nicks’ throaty lead and harmony vocals.\"  Billboard said that it \"packs a real wallop.\"\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe promotional music video shows Nicks performing the song direct to camera in a variety of different sets in what looks like a grand house. One of the sets is a long white room that looks like an art gallery and has three steps in the middle which Nicks, her backing singers Sharon Celani and Lori Perry, and two male dancers, perform choreographed dance steps together. Nicks' brother, Christopher, features in the video playing the saxophone.\n\n\n== Live performances ==\n\"Talk to Me\" made its live debut on the Rock a Little world tour in 1986. It was also included on the Canadian leg of The Other Side of the Mirror tour set in 1989. Nicks also performed on the 1991 \"Whole Lotta Trouble Tour\" to promote her greatest hits album Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks.\nThe last time it was played live was on the Street Angel Tour in 1994.\n\n\n== Single release formats ==\n\"Talk to Me\" was released as a 7-inch vinyl in many territories in the picture sleeve featured above, with \"One More Big Time Rock and Roll Star\" as its non-album B-side. Promo 7-inch singles with picture sleeve were also released in some countries, including the U.S., and featured the title track on both sides of the disc.\nPicture sleeves varied country by country in its European 7\" release, with Spain and Germany using sleeves which featured the artist name and title but no photograph, and the UK used a picture sleeve which featured the black-and-white photograph of Nicks which was used for the back cover of the Rock a Little LP sleeve. The single peaked at number 68 in the UK.\nA 3-track 12\" single was issued in the UK and Germany (but with differing picture sleeves), featuring the album version of the title track and \"One More Big Time Rock and Roll Star\" and \"Imperial Hotel\" as the B-sides.\nA 12-inch promo was released in the U.S. featuring a full-color glossy picture sleeve and additional inner sleeve, and the disc featured the title track in mono and stereo.\n\n\n== Other versions ==\nNicks re-recorded the song in 1986 for inclusion on the Time-Life compilation It's Only Rock and Roll.\nThe rock band Lovedrug included a live recording of \"Talk to Me\" on the fan-chosen covers album from the I AM LOVEDRUG campaign.

The current \"Women Only\" record of 2:16:16 was set by Peres Jepchirchir on April 21, 2024 at the London Marathon in the elite women's race.\n\n\n== History ==\nMarathon races were first held in 1896, but the distance was not standardized by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF, now World Athletics) until 1921.\nThe actual distance for pre-1921 races frequently varied from the 1921 standard of 42.195 km (26 miles 385 yards). In qualifying races for the 1896 Summer Olympics, Greek runners Charilaos Vasilakos (3:18:00) and Ioannis Lavrentis (3:11:27) won the first two modern marathons. On April 10, 1896, Spiridon Louis of Greece won the first Olympic marathon in Athens, Greece, in a time of 2:58:50. However, the distance for the event was 40,000 meters. Three months later, British runner Len Hurst won the inaugural Paris to Conflans Marathon (also around 40 km) in a time of 2:31:30. In 1900, Hurst would better his time on the same course with a 2:26:28 performance.\nLater, Shizo Kanakuri of Japan was reported to have set a world record of 2:32:45 in a November 1911 domestic qualification race for the 1912 Summer Olympics, but this performance was also run over a distance of approximately 40 km.\nThe first marathon over the official distance was won by American Johnny Hayes at the 1908 Summer Olympics, with a time of 2:55:18.4.\nIt is possible that Stamata Revithi, who ran the 1896 Olympic course a day after Louis, is the first woman to run the modern marathon; she is said to have finished in 5+1⁄2 hours. World Athletics credits Violet Piercy's 1926 performance as the first woman to race the standard marathon distance; however, other sources report that the 1918 performance of Marie-Louise Ledru in the Tour de Paris set the initial mark for women. Other \"unofficial\" performances have also been reported to be world bests or world records over time: although her performance is not recognized by World Athletics, Adrienne Beames from Australia is frequently credited as the first woman to break the three-hour barrier in the marathon.\nIn the 1953 Boston Marathon, the top three male finishers were thought to have broken the standing world record, but Keizo Yamada's mark of 2:18:51 is considered to have been set on a short course of 25.54 miles (41.1 km). The Boston Athletic Association also does not report Yamada's performance as a world best for this reason.\nOn October 25, 1981, American Alberto Salazar and New Zealander Allison Roe set apparent world bests at the New York City Marathon (2:08:13 and 2:25:29), however, these marks were invalidated when the course was later found to have been 151 meters short. Although World Athletics' progression notes three performances set on the same course in 1978, 1979, and 1980 by Norwegian Grete Waitz, the Association of Road Racing Statisticians considers the New York City course suspect for those performances, too.\nOn April 18, 2011, the Boston Marathon produced what were at that time the two fastest marathon performances of all time. Winner Geoffrey Mutai of Kenya recorded a time of 2:03:02, followed by countryman Moses Mosop in 2:03:06. However, since the Boston course does not meet the criteria for record attempts, these times were not ratified by the IAAF.\nEight IAAF world records were set at the Polytechnic Marath\nModern liberalism (often simply referred to in the United States as liberalism) is the dominant version of liberalism in the United States. It combines ideas of civil liberty and equality with support for social justice and a mixed economy.\nModern liberalism is one of two major political ideologies of the United States, with the other being conservatism. According to American philosopher Ian Adams, all major American parties are \"liberal and always have been. Essentially they espouse classical liberalism, that is a form of democratized Whig constitutionalism plus the free market. The point of difference comes with the influence of social liberalism\". Economically, modern liberalism supports government regulation on private industry, opposes corporate monopolies, and supports labor rights. Its fiscal policy opposes any reduction in spending on the social safety net, while simultaneously promoting income-proportional tax reform policies to reduce deficits. It calls for active government involvement in other social and economic matters such as: reducing economic inequality, increasing diversity, expanding access to education and healthcare, regulating economic activity, and environmentalism. Modern liberalism is a large and mainstream ideology in the Democratic Party and nation. Modern liberalism was formed in the 20th century in response to the Great Depression. Major examples of modern liberal policy programs include the New Deal, the Fair Deal, the New Frontier, the Great Society, the Affordable Care Act and the Inflation Reduction Act.\nIn the first half of the 20th century, both major American parties shared influential conservative and liberal wings. The conservative northern Republicans and Southern Democrats formed the conservative coalition which dominated the Congress from 1937 until the Johnson administration. After World War Two, northern Democrats began to support civil rights and organized labor, while voters and politicians in the formerly \"Solid South\" opposed them from within the Democratic Party. Following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, conservative Democrats began an exodus from the party, and supported Republican candidate Richard Nixon in 1968. By the 1970s the Democratic Party became predominately liberal and the Republican Party adopted conservatism as the party's main ideology. As a group, \"liberals\" are referred to as left or center-left and \"conservatives\" as right or center-right. Starting in the 21st century, there has also been a sharp division between liberals who tend to live in denser, more heterogeneous urban areas and conservatives who tend to live in less dense, more homogeneous rural communities, with suburban areas largely split between the two. Since the 2000 election, blue and red have been the party colors of the Democrats and Republicans respectively, in contrast to the use of blue for conservatism and red for leftism in the rest of the Western world.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe modern liberal philosophy strongly endorses public spending on programs such as education, health care, and welfare. Important social issues during the 21st century include social justice, economic inequality (wealth and income), voting rights for minorities, affirmative action, reproductive and other women's rights, support for LGBT rights, and immigration reform. Modern liberalism took shape during the 20th century, with roots in Theodore Roosevelt's Square Deal and New Nationalism, Woodrow Wilson's New Freedom, Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, Harry S. Truman's Fair Deal, John F. Kennedy's New Frontier and Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society. Modern liberals oppose conservatives on most but not all issues. Although historically related to social liberalism and progressivism, the current relationship between liberal and progressive viewpoints is debated. Modern liberalism is typically associated with the Democratic Party while modern conservatism is typically associated with the Republican Party.\nIn 1941, Fr\nModern Romance is a British pop music band that found popularity in the early 1980s. Formed in 1980 by previous members of an earlier group, the Leyton Buzzards, the band achieved a string of UK chart hits before the original group broke up in 1985. Andy Kyriacou reformed the band in 1999 who continue to perform the group's music.\n\n\n== Band history ==\nGeoffrey Deane and David Jaymes formed Modern Romance in 1980, having previously been the mainstays of the punk parody band the Leyton Buzzards which they formed in 1977.\nThe band split up in 1980 though Deane and Jaymes continued working together, embracing the burgeoning electronic style of dance music that was becoming popular in London clubs at the time. They found a new manager and created a limited company called Business Art Productions, and signed to WEA. In 1980, their first release, eponymously titled \"Modern Romance\", was unsuccessful. After a second unsuccessful single, \"Tonight\", the band then opted to lessen the predominantly electronic sound in favour of a Latin-American dance style with emphasis on bass, percussion and brass. They recruited trumpet player John Du Prez into their new line-up. The band released a new single, \"Everybody Salsa\" in summer 1981, which reached the UK Top 20. However, prior to the release, they recruited a new drummer, Andy Kyriacou, who began promoting the single with the band, and set up their first personal appearance in a club.\nThey followed this later in the year with similarly themed \"Ay Ay Ay Ay Moosey\", which reached the UK Top 10. Despite these two hits, the band's debut album, Adventures in Clubland, was not a success. However, in the US they scored a number 2 hit on the Billboard Dance chart with \"Can You Move\", a mostly rap variation of \"Everybody Salsa\". After further UK Top 40 hits with \"Queen of the Rapping Scene\" and a cover of the 1955 hit \"Cherry Pink And Apple Blossom White\", Deane departed the band in 1982 to pursue solo projects.\nMichael J. Mullins took over the mantle of lead vocalist, and their next release saw the band reach their highest UK chart position with \"Best Years of Our Lives\" in late 1982. Further hits followed in 1983: \"High Life\" (UK No. 8), \"Don't Stop That Crazy Rhythm\" (UK No. 14), and the ballad \"Walking in the Rain\" (UK No. 7). Both \"Best Years of Our Lives\" and \"Walking in the Rain\" earned Silver discs. Despite being regularly featured in teen pin-up magazines, the band's commercial hot streak waned and further singles were less successful. The band released a compilation album for the Christmas 1983 market entitled Party Tonight. Though it only peaked at No. 45 in the UK, it became their most successful album and was certified gold for sales in excess of 100,000 copies within six weeks of release.\nJohn Du Prez then left the band, and after disagreements with their record company, WEA, the band signed with RCA in 1984. This brought about a change of image – from bright coloured suits and wedge hairstyles to long hair and leather jackets. The band released a new single, a cover of The Temptations' 1971 hit \"Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me)\", but the single was not a success. Modern Romance released a final album, Burn It!, in 1985. The album was received poorly and the band called it quits after releasing the stand-alone single \"Tarzan Boy\" – a cover of the Baltimora hit from earlier that year – and an anthology mix of their biggest selling songs titled \"Best Mix of Our Lives\" (also 1985).\n\n\n== Post career ==\nAfter leaving Modern Romance, former lead vocalist Geoff Deane reappeared in 1983 as 'Geoff Deane & The Valley Girls' to release the single \"Navy Lark\", then again for the solo \"What About Romance\", and he also wrote \"You Think You're A Man\" for Divine. Deane later became a scriptwriter and television producer, scripting for television programmes such as Birds of a Feather, Babes in the Wood, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, Chef!, Last Man Standing, and A Many-Splintered Thing. In \nA phonograph record (also known as a gramophone record, especially in British English) or a vinyl record (for later varieties only) is an analog sound storage medium in the form of a flat disc with an inscribed, modulated spiral groove. The groove usually starts near the outside edge and ends near the center of the disc. The stored sound information is made audible by playing the record on a phonograph (or \"gramophone\", \"turntable\", or \"record player\").\nRecords have been produced in different formats with playing times ranging from a few minutes to around 30 minutes per side. For about half a century, the discs were commonly made from shellac and these records typically ran at a rotational speed of 78 rpm, giving it the nickname \"78s\" (\"seventy-eights\"). After the 1940s, \"vinyl\" records made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) became standard replacing the old 78s and remain so to this day; they have since been produced in various sizes and speeds, most commonly 7-inch discs played at 45 rpm (typically for singles, also called 45s (\"forty-fives\")), and 12-inch discs played at 33⅓ rpm (known as an LP, \"long-playing records\", typically for full-length albums) – the latter being the most prevalent format today.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe phonograph record was the primary medium used for music reproduction throughout the 20th century. It had co-existed with the phonograph cylinder from the late 1880s and had effectively superseded it by around 1912. Records retained the largest market share even when new formats such as the compact cassette were mass-marketed. By the 1980s, digital media, in the form of the compact disc, had gained a larger market share, and the record left the mainstream in 1991. Since the 1990s, records continue to be manufactured and sold on a smaller scale, and during the 1990s and early 2000s were commonly used by disc jockeys (DJs), especially in dance music genres. They were also listened to by a growing number of audiophiles. The phonograph record has made a niche resurgence in the early 21st century, growing increasingly popular throughout the 2010s and 2020s.\n\nPhonograph records are generally described by their diameter in inches (12-inch, 10-inch, 7-inch), the rotational speed in revolutions per minute (rpm) at which they are played (8+1⁄3, 16+2⁄3, 33+1⁄3, 45, 78), and their time capacity, determined by their diameter and speed (LP [long play], 12-inch disc, 33+1⁄3 rpm; EP [extended play], 12-inch disc or 7-inch disc, 33+1⁄3 or 45 rpm; Single, 7-inch or 10-inch disc, 45 or 78 rpm); their reproductive quality, or level of fidelity (high-fidelity, orthophonic, full-range, etc.); and the number of audio channels (mono, stereo, quad, etc.).\nThe phrase broken record refers to a malfunction when the needle skips/jumps back to the previous groove and plays the same section over and over again indefinitely.\n\n\n=== Naming ===\nThe various names have included phonograph record (American English), gramophone record (British English), record, vinyl, LP (originally a trademark of Columbia Records), black disc, album, and more informally platter, wax, or liquorice pizza.\n\n\n== Early development ==\nManufacture of disc records began in the late 19th century, at first competing with earlier cylinder records.  Price, ease of use and storage made the disc record dominant by the 1910s. The standard format of disc records became known to later generations as \"78s\" after their playback speed in revolutions per minute, although that speed only became standardized in the late 1920s.  In the late 1940s new formats pressed in vinyl, the 45 rpm single and 33 rpm long playing \"LP\", were introduced, gradually overtaking the formerly standard \"78s\" over the next decade.  The late 1950s saw the introduction of stereophonic sound on commercial discs.\n\n\n=== Predecessors ===\n\nThe phonautograph was invented by 1857 by Frenchman Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville. It could not, however, play back recorded sound, as Scott intended for people to read back\n4AD is a British record label owned by Beggars Group. It was founded in London under the name Axis Records by Ivo Watts-Russell and Peter Kent in 1980 as an imprint of Beggars Banquet Records. The name was changed to 4AD after the release of the label's first four singles. Later that year, Watts-Russell and Kent purchased the label from Beggars Banquet to become an independent record label, and Kent sold his share to Watts-Russell a year later.\nThe label gained prominence in the 1980s for releasing albums from alternative rock, post-punk, gothic rock, and dream pop artists, such as Bauhaus, Cocteau Twins, Modern English, Dead Can Dance, Clan of Xymox, Pixies, Throwing Muses, and Watts-Russell's own musical project This Mortal Coil. In 1987, the label scored an international hit with the dance music single \"Pump Up the Volume\" by the one-off project M|A|R|R|S. 4AD continued to have success in the 1990s and 2000s, with releases from The Breeders, Lush, Belly, Red House Painters, Camera Obscura, TV on the Radio, St. Vincent, and Bon Iver. As of January 2022, the label's current roster includes acts such as Dry Cleaning, The National, Daughter, Deerhunter, Big Thief, Aldous Harding, U.S. Girls, Erika de Casier, and Future Islands.\nIn 1999, Watts-Russell sold 4AD back to the Beggars Group. The label's history was detailed by Martin Aston in the book Facing The Other Way, released in 2013.\n\n\n== History ==\nIvo Watts-Russell and Peter Kent, employees of the Beggars Banquet record store and label, founded Axis Records (named after the Jimi Hendrix album) in late 1979 as a property of Beggars Banquet, that was run by the two of them. After the first four Axis singles in early 1980, it became apparent that the name Axis was already being used by another music company and the name was changed to 4AD, an abbreviation of the word forward. Other names which they had considered included 1980AD, 4WD and 1984.\nAn initial idea for the label was that it would be a \"testing ground\" for Beggars Banquet; successful acts would graduate up to Beggars Banquet after a year at 4AD. The only band to follow this path would be Bauhaus, who were signed to Beggars Banquet in late 1980, before Watts-Russell and Kent purchased the label outright.\nThe two were the sole owners for about a year. Kent sold his share to Watts-Russell at the end of 1981, and started a new Beggars Banquet subsidiary, Situation Two Records. Watts-Russell would maintain ownership of the label, and act as its president, until the late 1990s.\nWatts-Russell invited the graphic designer Vaughan Oliver and the photographer Nigel Grierson to create sleeve art for the label, and as a result, 4AD acquired a visually distinctive identity. Its artists, such as Cocteau Twins and Dead Can Dance, developed cult followings in the mid-1980s, but 4AD continued to evolve, and, after signing Throwing Muses and Pixies, the label increasingly concentrated on underground American rock music. In 1983, 4AD had a minor hit in America with the Modern English single \"I Melt With You\". In 1987, 4AD had a UK number-one hit with the collaged \"Pump up the Volume\" by M|A|R|R|S (licensed to 4th & B'Way/Island Records in the US).\nIn the 1990s, 4AD established an office in Los Angeles and had success with bands such as The Breeders, Belly, Red House Painters, Unrest and His Name Is Alive, as well as solo material by Frank Black and Kristin Hersh.\nThe label's deal with Warner Bros. Records in the United States in 1992 would start the beginning of a new phase in 4AD history. New signings that year included American underground acts Kendra Smith, Tarnation, Air Miami and The Amps. The following year Watts-Russell started a sub-label, Guernica, which would release records by Unrest, That Dog, and Bettie Serveert.\nIn 1999, Watts-Russell sold his share in 4AD back to the Beggars Group (as it had by then become), but the label continued to release music and add new artists to its roster.

The original band existed from 1970 to 1974 but their recordings were not released until 1976 or later. It featured Richman and bassist Ernie Brooks with drummer David Robinson (later of The Cars) and keyboardist Jerry Harrison (later of Talking Heads). The sound of the band owed a great deal to the influence of the Velvet Underground and the Stooges, and is now sometimes classified as \"proto-punk\". It pointed the way towards much of the punk rock, new wave, alternative and indie rock music of later decades. Their only album, the eponymous The Modern Lovers, contained idiosyncratic songs about dating awkwardness, growing up in Massachusetts, love of life, and the USA."

She liked the sound of the phrase so much that she told Jane she would write a song for it and give her credit for the inspiration.\nAlthough Nicks had originally planned to use the title for a song about Tom and Jane Petty, the death of her uncle Jonathan and the murder of John Lennon during the same week of December 1980 inspired a new song for which Nicks used the title. Nicks' producer and lover Jimmy Iovine was a close friend of Lennon, and Nicks felt helpless to comfort him. Soon after, Nicks flew home to Phoenix, Arizona, to be with her uncle Jonathan, who was dying of cancer. She remained with her uncle and his family until his death."

Moore's bands performed at well-known Los Angeles clubs, including Whisky a Go Go, The Troubadour, and Starwood, and headlined alongside The Police, The Knack, and The Motels.

Right before the family's move, Freddy and his cousin, Danny Wick, had started a band called The Royal Cumquats. Moore  graduated from Richfield, Minnesota High School in 1968. Fearful that he would be drafted to serve in the Vietnam War, he enrolled at the University of Minnesota to study Music Theory and Composition under composer Dominick Argento.\nAfter performances with his band An English Sky, Moore started performing as Skogie, c. 1970."

The standard format of disc records became known to later generations as \"78s\" after their playback speed in revolutions per minute, although that speed only became standardized in the late 1920s.  In the late 1940s new formats pressed in vinyl, the 45 rpm single and 33 rpm long playing \"LP\", were introduced, gradually overtaking the formerly standard \"78s\" over the next decade.

The only band to follow this path would be Bauhaus, who were signed to Beggars Banquet in late 1980, before Watts-Russell and Kent purchased the label outright."

        "content": "Reprise Records is an American record label founded in 1960 by Frank Sinatra. It is owned by Warner Music Group, and operates through Warner Records, one of its flagship labels.\nArtists currently signed to Reprise Records include Green Day, Enya, Michael Bublé, Eric Clapton, Stevie Nicks, Neil Young, Deftones, Mastodon, Lindsey Buckingham, Josh Groban, Disturbed, Idina Menzel, My Chemical Romance, Gerard Way, Dwight Yoakam, Never Shout Never, and Billy Strings.\n\n\n== Company history ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings ===\n\nReprise Records was formed in 1960 by Frank Sinatra in order to allow more artistic freedom for his own recordings. Soon thereafter, he garnered the nickname \"The Chairman of the Board\". Because of dissatisfaction with Capitol Records, and after trying to buy Norman Granz's Verve Records, the first album Sinatra released on Reprise was Ring-a-Ding-Ding! As CEO of Reprise, Sinatra recruited several artists for the fledgling label, such as fellow Rat Pack members Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. The original roster from 1961 to 1963 included Bing Crosby, Jo Stafford, Rosemary Clooney, Duke Ellington, Nancy Sinatra, Esquivel and stand-up comedian Redd Foxx. The original Reprise LP label had four different logos, depending on the genre: a riverboat for Pop records (pictured), a cherub for Jazz records, an owl for Spoken Word/Comedy records, and a picture of Sinatra for his records.\n\nOne of the label's founding principles under Sinatra's leadership was that each artist would have full creative freedom, and at some point complete ownership of their work, including publishing rights. This is the reason why recordings of early Reprise artists (Dean Martin, Jimi Hendrix, the Kinks, etc.) are (in most cases) currently distributed through other labels. In Martin's case, his Reprise recordings were out of print for nearly 20 years before a deal was struck with Capitol Records. Reprise continued to reissue the Sinatra catalog until 2013 when it was sold to Capitol.\n\n\n=== Sale to Warner Bros. ===\nIn August 1963, as part of a film deal, Warner Bros. purchased Reprise (which had been losing money) from Frank Sinatra, who nonetheless retained a 1/3 interest in the label. Many of the older artists on the label were dropped by Warner Bros. Records. Reprise president Mo Ostin was retained as the head of the label and he went on to play a very significant role in the history of the Warner group of labels over the next four decades. Warner-Reprise executives began targeting younger acts, beginning by securing the American distribution rights to the Pye Records recordings by the Kinks in 1964. Reprise soon added teen-oriented pop acts like Dino, Desi & Billy to the roster. As well, Sinatra's own daughter Nancy (who began recording for the label in 1961) was retained by Ostin, becoming a major pop star from late 1965. The label moved almost exclusively to rock-oriented music in the late 1960s, although Frank Sinatra continued to record for the label until the 1980s.\nThrough direct signings or distribution deals, by the 1970s the Reprise roster grew to include Lee Hazlewood, Jill Jackson, Jimi Hendrix, the early Joni Mitchell recordings, Neil Young, the Electric Prunes, Donna Loren, Arlo Guthrie, Norman Greenbaum, Tom Lehrer, Kenny Rogers and The First Edition, Tiny Tim, Ry Cooder, Captain Beefheart, John Sebastian, Family, the early 1970s recordings by Frank Zappa and the Mothers, Gram Parsons, Emmylou Harris, Nico's Desertshore, the Fugs, Jethro Tull, Pentangle, T. Rex, the Meters, John Cale, Gordon Lightfoot, Michael Franks, Richard Pryor, Al Jarreau, Fleetwood Mac, Fanny, and the Beach Boys.\n\n\n=== Dormancy ===\n\nIn 1976, the Reprise label was deactivated by Warner Bros. and all of its roster (except Frank Sinatra and Neil Young) was moved to the main Warner Bros. label. Although older catalog albums continued to be manufactured with the Reprise logo, and albums by the Beach Boys on Brother Records were issued in the Reprise catalog numbering seque\nThis is a list of current and former artists who have recorded for Reprise Records or one of its associated labels.\n\n\n== 0–9 ==\n40 Below Summer\n54-40\n8stops7\n\n\n== A ==\na-ha\nAhmad (Giant/Reprise)\nAimee Mann\nAir Supply (Giant/Reprise)\nAkina Nakamori\nAl Jarreau\nAlanis Morissette (Maverick/Reprise)\nAlexander Zonjic\nAllen Sherman\nAllen Toussaint\nAmerican Bang\nAmerican Music Club\nAnanda Shankar\nAndreas Johnson\nArkarna\nArlo Guthrie\nArmy of Lovers (Giant/Reprise) (US/Canada)\nArt of Dying (Intoxication/Reprise)\nAsh (North America)\nAtlantic Starr\n\n\n== B ==\nThe B-52s\nBabble\nBabes in Toyland\nBaker Knight\nBarenaked Ladies\nBarney Kessel\nBash & Pop (Sire/Reprise)\nBeatmasters (Rhythm King/Sire/Reprise)\nBelly (Sire/Reprise)\nBen Webster\nBert Jansch\nBeth Nielsen Chapman\nBetty Boo (Rhythm King/Sire/Reprise) (US/Canada)\nBig Country (Giant/Reprise) (US/Canada)\nBig Daddy Kane (Cold Chillin'/Reprise)\nBig Head Todd and the Monsters (Giant/Reprise)\nBigod 20 (Sire/Reprise)\nBill Miller\nBilly Corgan\nBilly Hill (Reprise Nashville)\nBilly Strings\nBing Crosby\nBlack Sabbath (US/Canada)\nBlake Shelton (Reprise Nashville)\nBloodsimple (Bullygoat/Reprise)\nBob Mosley\nBoDeans (Slash/Reprise)\nBone Thugs-N-Harmony (Asylum/Reprise)\nBonnie McKee\nBook of Love\nBoredoms\nBrady Seals\nBrian Wilson (Sire/Reprise)\nBrowning Bryant\nBryan Ferry (US/Canada)\nBT (Perfecto/Kinetic/Reprise)\nBuddy Ebsen\nBuddy Greco\nBulletboys\n\n\n== C ==\nCaleb Kane\nCaptain Beefheart\nCarlene Carter (Giant/Reprise Nashville)\nCavo\nChaka Khan\nCharice Pempengco\nCharice\nCharles Aznavour\nCharlie Daniels\nCher (US/Australia)\nChicago (Full Moon/Reprise)\nChris Cummings\nChris Isaak\nClaudia Church\nColdcut (Tommy Boy/Reprise)\nColor Me Badd (Giant/Reprise)\nCount Basie\nCraig David (US)\nCrime Mob (Crunk Incorporated/Reprise)\n\n\n== D ==\nDa Bush Babees\nDaddy Cool\nDario G (Kinetic/Reprise)\nDave Gahan (Mute/Reprise) (US/Canada/Mexico)\nDavid Lee Roth\nDavid Sanborn\nDean Martin\nDeborah Harry (Sire/Reprise)\nDebbie Reynolds\nDeftones\nDel Reeves\nDennis Robbins\nDenny Laine (US/Canada)\nDepeche Mode (Mute/Sire/Reprise) (US/Canada/Mexico)\nDevendra Banhart\nDinah Shore\nDino, Desi & Billy\nDio (US/Canada)\nDisturbed\nDivine Styler (Giant/Reprise)\nDon Ho & the Allies\nDonald Fagen\nDonna Loren\nDrill Team\nDuane Eddy\nDuke Ellington\nDwight Yoakam (Reprise Nashville)\n\n\n== E ==\nEd Sanders\nEddi Reader\nEisley\nElla Fitzgerald\nEmmylou Harris (Reprise Nashville)\nEnya\nEnya (US)\nErasure (Mute/Sire/Reprise) (US/Canada/Mexico)\nEric Benét (Friday/Reprise)\nEric Clapton (Duck/Reprise)\nEsquivel!\nEssra Mohawk\nEsthero\nEthel Merman\nEddie Cano\n\n\n== F ==\nFaith No More (Slash/Reprise)\nFamily\nFamily of the Year\nFanny\nFats Domino\nFilter\nFleetwood Mac\nFlo & Eddie\nForce MDs (Tommy Boy/Reprise)\nFrançoise Hardy (US and Canada, leased from Vogue)\nFrank Sinatra (Founder) \nFrank Zappa (Bizarre/Reprise)\nFrankie Ballard (Reprise Nashville)\n\n\n== G ==\nGerard Way\nGloriana (Emblem/Reprise Nashville)\nGoldie Hawn\nGordon Jenkins\nGordon Lightfoot\nGrace (Perfecto/Kinetic/Reprise)\nGram Parsons\nGrand Daddy I.U.

In Baroque music this usually occurs at the very end of a piece, repeating the final phrase with added ornamentation.\n\n\n== Song reprises ==\nReprise can refer to a version of a song which is similar to, yet different from, the song on which it is based. One example could be \"Time\", the fourth song from Pink Floyd's 1973 album The Dark Side of the Moon, which contains a reprise of \"Breathe\", the second song of the same album. Another example could be \"Solo\", the fifth song from Frank Ocean's 2016 album Blonde, and then \"Solo (Reprise)\", the tenth song of the same album. Be Here Now, the 1997 album by Oasis, features a reprise of \"All Around the World\", while the title track of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which plays at the start of the album to introduce it, has a reprise at the end of the album to close it by replacing lines like \"we hope you will enjoy the show\" with \"we hope you have enjoyed the show\". Impera by Ghost features a reprise on the final track, \"Respite on the Spitalfields\", of a riff previously featured in the opening track, \"Imperium\".\n\n\n=== Musical theater ===\nIn musical theatre, reprises are any repetition of an earlier song or theme, usually with changed lyrics and shortened music to reflect the development of the story. Also, it is common for songs sung by the same character or regarding the same narrative motif to have similar tunes and lyrics, or incorporate similar tunes and lyrics. For example, in the stage version of Les Misérables, a song of the primary antagonist (\"Javert's Suicide\") is similar in lyrics and exactly the same in tune to a soliloquy of the protagonist when he was in a similar emotional state (\"What Have I Done?\"). At the end of the song, an instrumental portion is played from an earlier soliloquy of the antagonist, in which he was significantly more confident. Les Misérables in general reprises many musical themes..\nOften the reprised version of a song has exactly the same tune and lyrics as the original, though frequently featuring different characters singing or including them with the original character in the reprised version. For example, in The Sound of Music, the reprise of the title song is sung by the Von Trapp children and their father, the Captain; whereas the original was sung by Maria. In \"Edelweiss\" (reprise), the entire Von Trapp family and Maria sing and are later joined by the audience, whereas the original features Liesl and the Captain..\nAlso, in the musical The Music Man, the love song \"Goodnight My Someone\" uses the same basic melody (though with a more ballad quality to it) as the rousing march and theme song \"Seventy-Six Trombones\"; in the reprised versions, Harold and Marian are heard singing a snatch of each other's songs. And in Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II's Show Boat, the song \"Ol' Man River\" is reprised three times after it is first sung, as if it were a commentary on the situation in the story. In some musicals, a reprise of an earlier song is sung by a different character from the one who originally sang it, with different lyrics.\nIn Mamma Mia!, however, the reprises for the title track, Dancing Queen, and Waterloo have no altering of the lyrics, and are just shortened versions of the originals featured earlier.\nIn RENT, the song, \"I'll Cover You\" gets a reprise at Angel's funeral. It is sung primarily by Collins and is slower and more emotional to reflect Collins' emotional state. Nearing the end of the song, the rest of the company begins singing a slower version of the first verse of \"Sea\nWarner Records Inc. (known as Warner Bros. Records Inc. until 2019) is an American record label.  A subsidiary of the Warner Music Group, it is headquartered in Los Angeles, California. It was founded on March 19, 1958, as the recorded music division of the American film studio Warner Bros.\nArtists who have recorded for Warner Records include  Madonna, Prince, Linkin Park, Zach Bryan, Van Halen, Kylie Minogue, ZZ Top, Gorillaz, Bette Midler, Grateful Dead, Jane's Addiction, Duran Duran, Fleetwood Mac, Rod Stewart, Funkadelic, James Taylor,  Red Hot Chili Peppers, Mac Miller, R.E.M., Bob James, David Sanborn, and the Sex Pistols.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\nAt the end of the silent movie period, Warner Bros. Pictures decided to expand into publishing and recording so that it could access low-cost music content for its films. In 1928, the studio acquired several smaller music publishing firms which included M. Witmark & Sons, Harms Inc., and a partial interest in New World Music Corp., and merged them to form the Music Publishers Holding Company. This new group controlled valuable copyrights on standards by George and Ira Gershwin and Jerome Kern, and the new division was soon earning solid profits of up to US$2 million every year.\nIn 1930, Music Publishers Holding Company (MPHC) paid US$28 million to acquire Brunswick Records (which included Vocalion), whose roster included Duke Ellington, Red Nichols, Nick Lucas, Al Jolson, Earl Burtnett, Ethel Waters, Abe Lyman, Leroy Carr, Tampa Red and Memphis Minnie, and soon after the sale to Warner Bros., the label signed rising radio and recording stars Bing Crosby, Mills Brothers, and Boswell Sisters. Unfortunately for Warner Bros., the dual impact of the Great Depression and the introduction of broadcast radio greatly harmed the recording industry—sales crashed, dropping by around 90% from more than 100 million records in 1927 to fewer than 10 million by 1932 and major companies were forced to halve the price of records from 75 to 35 cents.\nIn December 1931, Warner Bros. offloaded Brunswick to the American Record Corporation (ARC) for a fraction of its former value, in a lease arrangement which did not include Brunswick's pressing plants. Technically, Warner maintained actual ownership of Brunswick, which with the sale of ARC to CBS in 1939 and their decision to discontinue Brunswick in favor of reviving the Columbia label, reverted to Warner Bros. Warner Bros. sold Brunswick a second time (along with Brunswick's back catalog up to 1931) in 1941, this time along with the old Brunswick pressing plants Warner owned, to Decca Records (which formed its American operations in 1934) in exchange for a financial interest in Decca. The heavy loss it incurred in the Brunswick deal kept the studio out of the record business for almost 20 years, and during this period it licensed its film music to other companies for release as soundtrack albums.\n\n\n=== 1958–1963: formation and early years ===\n  \nWarner Bros. returned to the record business on March 19, 1958, with the establishment of its own recording division, Warner Bros. Records. By this time, the established Hollywood studios were reeling from multiple challenges to their former dominance—the most notable being the introduction of television in the late 1940s. Legal changes also had a major impact on their business—lawsuits brought by major stars had effectively overthrown the old studio contract system by the late 1940s and, beginning in 1949, anti-trust suits brought by the U.S. government forced the five major studios to divest their cinema chains.\nIn 1956, Harry Warner and Albert Warner sold their interest in the studio and the board was joined by new members who favored a renewed expansion into the music business—Charles Allen of the investment bank Charles Allen & Company, Serge Semenenko of the First National Bank of Boston and investor David Baird. Semenenko in particular had a strong professional interest in the entertainment \nBrave Belt was a Canadian rock band from Winnipeg, Manitoba originally consisting of Randy Bachman (guitar/vocals), his former Guess Who bandmate, Chad Allan (vocals/keyboards), and Randy's brother Robbie (drums). Randy also provided bass tracks for the recording of the band's first album, Brave Belt (Reprise Records, 1971). C. F. \"Fred\" Turner was added shortly after as bassist for the supporting concerts.\nThe band made the Canadian Top 40 with the minor hit \"Crazy Arms, Crazy Eyes,\" which peaked at No. 35 in November 1971.  However, they missed the U.S. charts completely.\nIn 1972, Turner became the lead vocalist for the Brave Belt II album. Allan left the band after the recording was completed. During the supporting concerts for Brave Belt II, Tim Bachman was added as a second guitarist. Despite the changes, Brave Belt II sold poorly and the band struggled to book live shows. In a 1974 Rolling Stone interview, Randy estimated there were losses of about $150,000 in 1971-72 ($923,000 in 2020 dollars), with himself personally absorbing about 60% of the loss, as he was paying the other band member salaries from his Guess Who royalties.\nAlthough dropped from the Reprise label, the Brave Belt II lineup (C. F. Turner with Randy, Tim and Robbie Bachman) recorded and shopped around a demo that was supposed to be a Brave Belt III album.  New management convinced them to change their name − they eventually settled on Bachman–Turner Overdrive.\nThus, the eponymous first Bachman–Turner Overdrive album is essentially Brave Belt III, the album that was rejected by Reprise Records. Bachman had contacted many record labels to get the Brave Belt III tapes signed.  Charlie Fach at Mercury eventually listened to the tapes and liked what he heard. Bachman listened to some suggestions, remixed and re-edited the tapes, and the band recorded at least two new songs. The result was the first Bachman–Turner Overdrive album for Mercury, released in May 1973.\nThough Brave Belt is relatively unknown some 40 years later, the importance of the band was summed up by Randy Bachman in a 2001 interview:\n\"It was an innocent time of soul-searching. Nobody would play with me when I left The Guess Who. I was completely black-listed. I couldn't get a decent musician to play with me, except Chad Allan, who had also been in The Guess Who and left. He and I bonded together, and I might not have gotten started without him, even though he left sometime after that first album. Those [Brave Belt] albums are so important to me because, for the first time, I was making my own music, paying for it, finding strengths in it, and going through the process of finding the right music for the record. It led to me becoming a stronger producer for BTO.\"\nBrave Belt I and Brave Belt II were re-released on a single CD March 17, 2009.\n\n\n== Albums ==\n\n\n=== Brave Belt - Reprise Records - 1971 ===\n\n\n==== Track listing ====\nSide One\n\"Crazy Arms, Crazy Eyes\" - (Randy Bachman) - 2:44\n\"Lifetime\" - (Randy Bachman) - 1:53\n\"Waitin' There For Me\" - (Randy Bachman) - 3:17\n\"I Am The Man\" - (Chad Allan) - 4:03\n\"French Kiss\" - (Chad Allan, Rob Matheson) - 3:46\n\"It's Over\" - (Randy Bachman) - 3:05\nSide Two\n \"Rock And Roll Band\" - (Chad Allan) - 3:52\n\"Wandering Fantasy Girl\" - (Chad Allan) - 2:50\n\"I Wouldn't Trade My Guitar For A Woman\" - (Chad Allan) - 1:47\n\"Holy Train\" - (Chad Allan) - 3:05\n\"Anyday Means Tomorrow\" - (Randy Bachman) - 3:02\n\"Scarecrow\" - (Chad Allan, Rob Matheson) - 5:38\n\n\n==== Personnel ====\nChad Allan - piano, lead (4, 5, 8, 10, 12), co-lead (1, 2, 7, 9) and backing (11) vocals, accordion, rhythm guitar, mandolin\nRandy Bachman - lead guitar, lead (3, 6, 11), co-lead (1, 2, 7, 9) and backing vocals, bass, herzog\nRobbie Bachman - drums (1-8, 10, 11), percussion\nAdditional Personnel\nWally Didduck - fiddle\nRon Halldorson - pedal steel guitar\nBilly Mac - drums (9, 12)\n\n\n=== Brave Belt II - Reprise Records - 1972 ===\n\n\n==== Track listing ====\nSide One\n\"Too Far Away\" - (Randy Bachman) - 3:38\n\nAmerican vocalist Frank Sinatra recorded 59 studio albums and 297 singles in his solo career, spanning 54 years. \nSinatra after having had stints with the quartet The Hoboken Four and with the orchestras of Harry James and Tommy Dorsey, launched a solo career in 1943, signing with Columbia Records; his debut album The Voice of Frank Sinatra was issued in 1946.

Wachtel has worked as session musician for other artists such as Linda Ronstadt, Beth Hart, Stevie Nicks, Kim Carnes, Randy Newman, Keith Richards, The Rolling Stones (lead guitar on \"Saint of Me\"), Jon Bon Jovi, James Taylor, Iggy Pop, Warren Zevon, Bryan Ferry, Michael Sweet, Jackson Browne, Karla Bonoff, and Andrew Gold, both in the studio and live.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nWachtel was born May 24, 1947, in Jackson Heights to a Jewish family in the New York City borough of Queens. At about age 9–10, Wachtel began to learn to play the guitar, taking lessons with teacher Gene Dell (who insisted that he learn to play right-handed despite being naturally left-handed) until about age 14. At that age, he says, he began writing songs.\nWachtel also studied with Rudolph Schramm, who was the head of the NBC staff orchestra and went on to teach music at Carnegie Hall. Schramm tried to get Wachtel to take piano lessons, but Wachtel was intent on playing guitar so Schramm agreed to give him guitar lessons three times a week on rhythm, melody and harmony.\nAfter performing with local bands in the New York area, Wachtel formed his own band, The Orphans, who played in Connecticut and New Hampshire. Eventually the band settled into a regular bar band routine, playing in Newport, Rhode Island, where Wachtel took lessons from Sal Salvador. When the Orphans disbanded, he formed another band, Twice Nicely. At the suggestion of Bud Cowsill (of The Cowsills), he brought Twice Nicely to Los Angeles in 1968 where they recorded a few demos, but after two years, Wachtel decided to work as a session player.\n\n\n== Films ==\nIn 1972, he made an appearance in the film The Poseidon Adventure as the acoustic guitar player in a fictitious band on stage in the dining room when the ship capsizes.  Waddy appeared alongside Linda Ronstadt in the 1978 film, FM.  He also played in the Oscar-winning short film, \"Session Man\" in 1991.\nWachtel has composed and played instruments for film scores including Joe Dirt, Up in Smoke, Nice Guys Sleep Alone, The Longest Yard, The Benchwarmers, Grandma's Boy, Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star, Strange Wilderness, The House Bunny, and Paul Blart: Mall Cop. He has also composed, produced, or performed in songs with Warren Zevon, Joe Walsh, Jackson Browne, Linda Ronstadt and others.\n\n\n== Session and touring work ==\nIn 1972, he was hired by Warren Zevon to play guitar on The Everly Brothers' Stories We Could Tell album and join them in a subsequent tour.\nBy 1973, he played with Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks on their first album Buckingham Nicks (credited as 'Waddy', no surname), and on tour. Later, when Nicks and Buckingham joined Fleetwood Mac, he played rhythm guitar on their 1975 album Fleetwood Mac on the track \"Sugar Daddy\".\nIn 1980, he wrote, recorded and sang lead vocals on an album for producer Peter Asher with members of Linda Ronstadt's band, including musicians Don Grolnick, Dan Dugmore, Stanley Sheldon and Rick Marotta. Both the group and the album were titled Ronin. Released on the Mercury label, the record never charted.\nIn 1984, he played on Steve Perry's (Journey) solo album Street Talk.\nHe has appeared on hundreds of albums with many different artists and bands.\nProduction credits include albums by Stevie Nicks, Keith Richards, Jackson Browne, Bryan Ferry, The Church, Sand Rubies, George Thorogood and the Destroyers and Warren Zevon. Wachtel co-wrote several songs with Zevon including \"Werewolves of London\". He also co-wrote the Warren Zevon song \"Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead\" from the album Mr. Bad Example. He performed on all seven Warren Zevon albums from 1976 through 1992, producing or co-producing three.\nWachtel also shares co-writing credits with Stevie Nicks on a few tracks such as \"Annabel Lee\", and \"I Don't Care\".\nWachtel has been credited on some albums as Bob Wach\nJames Lee Keltner (born April 27, 1942) is an American drummer and percussionist known primarily for his session work. He was characterized by Bob Dylan biographer Howard Sounes as \"the leading session drummer in America\".\n\n\n== Career ==\nKeltner was inspired to start playing because of an interest in jazz, but the popularity of jazz was declining during the late 1950s and early 1960s, and it was the explosion of pop/rock in the mid-1960s that enabled him to break into recording work in Los Angeles. His first gig as a session musician was recording \"She's Just My Style\" for the pop group Gary Lewis and the Playboys.\nKeltner's music career was hardly paying a living, and for several years at the outset he was supported by his wife. Toward the end of the 1960s, he finally began getting regular session work and eventually became one of the busiest drummers in Los Angeles. His earliest credited performances on record were with Gabor Szabo on the 1968 album Bacchanal.\nIn 1968, Keltner was also working in a music shop in Pasadena just down the street from the old Ice House coffeehouse when he was recruited to play drums in a \"psychedelic\" vocal group named \"MC Squared\" along with Michael Crowley, Michael Clough, Linda Carey—all from the folk group The Back Porch Majority)—and session guitarist/bassist Randy Cierley Sterling. They were signed by Mo Ostin and recorded an album for Warner/Reprise originally titled \"MC Squared\" which has later been re-mastered and re-released in 2012 with the album title \"Tantalizing Colors.\" They appeared live that same year on the Hugh Hefner / Playboy Magazine television show Playboy After Dark, playing two songs:  an original by MC Squared members Michael Clough and Michael Crowley titled \"I Know You\" and a version of the Fred Neil song Everybody's Talkin'.  Both Playboy After Dark performances with Keltner playing drums can currently be viewed on YouTube.\nIt was his work with Leon Russell playing on Delaney & Bonnie's Accept No Substitute that attracted the attention of Joe Cocker, who recruited Russell and everyone else he could out of the Delaney & Bonnie band for his  Mad Dogs & Englishmen tour. Playing with Joe Cocker led to work in 1970 and 1971, on records by Carly Simon (No Secrets), Barbra Streisand (Barbra Joan Streisand), Booker T. Jones (Booker T. & Priscilla), George Harrison (The Concert for Bangladesh) and John Lennon (Imagine).\n\n\n=== Former Beatles ===\nKeltner is known for his session work on solo recordings by three members of the Beatles, working with George Harrison, John Lennon (including Lennon solo albums, as well as albums released both by the Plastic Ono Band and Yoko Ono), and Ringo Starr.\nKeltner played on many former Beatle solo releases, including Harrison's 1973 album Living in the Material World and Lennon's 1974 album Walls and Bridges. When Ringo Starr recorded his first full-fledged pop album, Ringo, Keltner was featured on five tracks. Following this, Keltner joined George Harrison on his 1974 tour of the United States.\nIn 1974, Keltner played on the Lennon-produced Harry Nilsson album Pussy Cats alongside Ringo (and Keith Moon) on \"Rock Around the Clock\". Keltner was featured on the Nilsson albums Son of Schmilsson with Harrison, Starr and Beatles associate Klaus Voormann as well as Duit on Mon Dei with Starr and Voormann.\nKeltner's relationship with the former Beatles was such that, in 1973, his name was used to mock Paul McCartney on albums released by Harrison and Starr. Early that year, McCartney, the only Beatle not to have worked with Keltner, included a note on the back cover of his Red Rose Speedway album, encouraging fans to join the \"Wings Fun Club\" by sending a \"stamped addressed envelope\" to an address in London. Later that year, both Harrison's Living in the Material World and Starr's Ringo contained a similar note encouraging fans to join the \"Jim Keltner Fan Club\" by sending a \"stamped undressed elephant\" to an address in Hollywood. Keltner performed \nHerbert Butros Khaury (April 12, 1932 – November 30, 1996), also known as Herbert Buckingham Khaury, and known professionally as Tiny Tim, was an American musician and musical archivist. He is especially known for his 1968 hit recording of \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\", a cover of the popular song \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips with Me\" from the 1929 musical Gold Diggers of Broadway. Tiny Tim was renowned for his wide vocal range, in particular his far-reaching falsetto.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nTiny Tim was born Herbert Khaury in Manhattan, New York City, on April 12, 1932. His mother Tillie (née Staff), a Polish-Jewish garment worker, was the daughter of a rabbi. She had immigrated from Brest-Litovsk, present-day Belarus, as a teen in 1914. His father, Butros Khaury, was a textile worker from Beirut, present-day Lebanon, and the son of a  Maronite Catholic priest. Tiny Tim himself was a devout Catholic.\nKhaury displayed an interest in music at a very young age. At the age of five, his father gave him a vintage wind-up gramophone and a 78-RPM record of \"Beautiful Ohio\" by Henry Burr. Khaury has passionately praised Burr, telling Johnny Carson that \"the wonderful Henry Burr's\" circa-1915 records inspired his own singing style. He would sit for hours listening to the record. At the age of six, he began teaching himself guitar. By his pre-teen years, he developed a passion for records, specifically those from the 1900s through the 1930s. He began spending most of his free time at the New York Public Library, reading about the history of the phonograph industry and its first recording artists. He researched sheet music, often making photographic copies to take home to learn, a hobby he continued for his entire life. He grew up in the Washington Heights neighborhood in Manhattan, where he attended George Washington High School.\nIn 1945, while recovering from appendix removal, he read the Bible and listened to music on the radio. After his recovery, he rarely left his room except to go to school, where he was described as a mediocre student. He dropped out of high school after continuously repeating his sophomore year, taking a series of menial jobs. Around this time, he discovered he could sing in a high register while listening to Rudy Vallée and taught himself to play ukulele using an Arthur Godfrey method book. He would later describe this period of his life as a \"religious experience\".\n\n\n=== The Singing Canary ===\nBy the early 1950s, Tiny Tim had landed a job as a messenger at the New York office of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, where he became ever more fascinated with the entertainment industry. He then entered a local talent show and sang \"You Are My Sunshine\" in his newly discovered falsetto. He started performing at dance club amateur nights under different names, such as \"Texarkana Tex\", \"Judas K. Foxglove\", \"Vernon Castle\", and \"Emmett Swink.\" To stand out as a performer, he wore wild clothing, grew his hair long and wore pasty white face makeup, partly inspired by Rudolph Valentino. His mother did not understand Herbert's change in appearance and was intending to take her now-twentysomething son to see a psychiatrist at Bellevue Hospital until his father stepped in. \n\nIn 1959, he performed as \"Larry Love, the Singing Canary\" at Hubert's Museum and Live Flea Circus in New York City's Times Square. While there, he signed with a manager who sent him on unpaid auditions throughout Greenwich Village. At this stage he began performing the song that would later become his signature, \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\". In 1963, he landed his first paid gig at Page 3, a lesbian-run club on the corner of Charles Street and Seventh Avenue, playing six hours a night and six nights a week for $96 per month. For the next two years, he performed as \"Dary Dover\" and later \"Sir Timothy Timms\". After a show in which he was booked to follow a \"midget\" act, his manager George King decided to bill him as \"Tiny Tim\" - a name which st\nThe American jazz singer Sammy Davis Jr. recorded extensively throughout his career and most recordings remain in the catalogs as various reissues.

When he was young, his family moved to Sacramento. He first started drumming in his early teens playing the drums for the band Phallucy in the early 90s. During this time, he also drummed for Deftones on the side, when the band was having problems landing a permanent and dedicated drummer. At the time when he started learning drums, he also learned how to play guitar, but growing up with a stepfather (Neil) who played the drums, he took a deeper passion with the drums. Abe's father, Sid, was also a musician and an early influence for Abe before his untimely passing. His influences include Stewart Copeland, Ginger Baker and Mitch Mitchell.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\nCunningham is known for his frantic, pounding rhythms on such songs as \"Knife Prty\" and clever usage of tempo (\"Mein\"), while at the same time refusing to indulge in the double bass drum setup of many metal traditionalists. However, he does use a double bass pedal as part of his kit, as seen in various drum magazines. A BBC reviewer has praised his style for displaying \"the assured expressiveness of a musician whose abilities stretch further than most metal-scene sticksmen\".\n\n\n== Other ventures ==\nCunningham has been a long time endorser of Tama Drums and Zildjian Cymbals, and for most of his career, has played the same setup. He has been featured in various ads for Tama and Zildjian. He is an endorser of Vater drumsticks, and at the 2017 NAMM Show revealed his new signature Vater drumsticks, the model is called \"Cool Breeze\" (which is Abe's nickname of sorts).\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nCunningham lives in Sacramento, California, with his family. He has two sons, Sidney and Daniel, with his ex-wife, Annalynn Seal. Annalynn made a guest appearance on \"MX\" singing along with Chino Moreno.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== With Deftones ===\nAdrenaline (1995, Maverick Records/Warner Bros.

A member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame since 2001 (his induction speech was given by longtime fan Keith Richards), Burton has also been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum. He was elected into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2024. Critic Mark Deming writes that \"Burton has a well-deserved reputation as one of the finest guitar pickers in either country or rock ... Burton is one of the best guitar players to ever touch a fretboard.\" He is ranked number 24 in Rolling Stone list of 250 greatest guitarists of all time.\nSince the 1950s, Burton has recorded and performed with an array of singers, including Bob Luman, Dale Hawkins, Ricky Nelson, Elvis Presley (and was leader of Presley's TCB Band), The Everly Brothers, Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, Glen Campbell, John Denver, Gram Parsons, Emmylou Harris, Judy Collins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Claude King, Elvis Costello, Joe Osborn, Roy Orbison, Joni Mitchell, Hoyt Axton, Townes Van Zandt, Steve Young, Vince Gill, and Suzi Quatro.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and career ===\nBurton was born in Dubberly in south Webster Parish near Minden, Louisiana, to Guy M. Burton (1909–2001) and the former Lola Poland (1914–2011), a native of rural Fryeburg in Bienville Parish. She was the daughter of James and Althius Poland. Burton's wife is Louise Burton.\nSelf-taught, Burton began playing guitar during childhood. He was hired to be part of the staff band for the popular Louisiana Hayride radio show in Shreveport. While he was still a teenager, Burton left Shreveport for Los Angeles, where he joined Ricky Nelson's band. There, he made numerous recordings as a session musician. Burton created and played the guitar solo on Dale Hawkins 1957 hit song \"Susie Q\", a record that would become one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.  He had originally written the song as an instrumental before Hawkins wrote lyrics for it; Burton never received credit or royalties for his contributions to \"Susie Q\".\n\n\n=== With Ricky Nelson, work as a session musician, and Shindig! ===\nBurton played guitar on the majority of Ricky Nelson's songs recorded during the first 11 years of Nelson's career, beginning with his premiere at Master Recorders in Hollywood on November 18, 1957, for the classic \"Stood Up\"/\"Waitin' in School\" rockabilly single.  At this time, Burton was relegated to rhythm as Joe Maphis was still playing lead guitar for Nelson.  Ricky Nelson's original (regular) band included Burton and double bassist James Kirkland; Kirkland was later replaced by Joe Osborn on electric bass.\nBurton's first single as Nelson's lead guitarist was \"Believe What You Say\".  In 1965 he started working on the television program Shindig! which curtailed his touring with Nelson. However, Burton continued contributing to his friend's studio albums through the Perspective sessions in April 1968.\nThe Shindig! exposure led to recording session work with a variety of artists, mostly as an unattributed sideman. In 1966, he began focusing more on his work as a session guitarist. \nIn 1967 Burton played Dobro on the Richie Furay song, \"A Child's Claim To Fame\" on Buffalo Springfield's second album, Buffalo Springfield Again. Due to the volume of work, Burton turned down an offer to join Bob Dylan's first touring band, and another offer to play on Elvis Presley's 1968 comeback TV special Elvis.\n\n\n=== With Elvis Presley ===\nIn 1969, Presley again asked Burton to join his show in Las Vegas, and, this time, Burton accepted. Burton organized the TCB Band, serving as its leader, and backed Presley from 1969 until Presley's death in 1977.  A hallmark of Elvis' live shows during this period was his exhortation, \"Play it, James\", as a cue for the guitarist's solos. For the first season in Vegas in 1969, Burton played his red standard Telecaster. Shortly the\nMichael Wayne Campbell (born February 1, 1950) is an American guitarist and vocalist. He was a member of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and co-wrote many of the band's hits with Petty, including \"Refugee\", \"Here Comes My Girl\", \"You Got Lucky\", and \"Runnin' Down a Dream\".  Outside of The Heartbreakers, he has worked as a session guitarist and songwriter with a number of other acts, including composing and playing on the Don Henley hits \"The Boys of Summer\" & \"The Heart of the Matter\" as well as working on most of Stevie Nicks's solo albums. Campbell, along with Neil Finn, joined Fleetwood Mac to replace lead guitarist Lindsey Buckingham on their world tour in 2018–2019.  After the end of that tour, he has been involved in his own band, the Dirty Knobs. As of 2024, the Dirty Knobs have released three albums.\nOn November 11, 2011, Rolling Stone magazine named Campbell in their list of the top 100 guitarists, coming in at number 79. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002 as a member of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nCampbell was born on February 1, 1950, in Panama City, Florida. He grew up there and in Jacksonville, Florida, where he graduated from Jean Ribault High School in 1968. At the age of 16, his mother, Helen Barber, bought him his first guitar, a Harmony acoustic model which he later described as \"unplayable\" from a pawnshop. His first electric guitar was a $60 Guyatone, but playing a friend's Gibson SG (a model which Campbell would not own himself for many years) was a transformative experience. Like Tom Petty, Campbell drew his strongest influences from The Byrds and Bob Dylan, with additional inspiration coming from guitarists such as Scotty Moore, Luther Perkins, George Harrison, Carl Wilson, Jerry Garcia, Roger McGuinn, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Jimmy Page, Mick Taylor, and Neil Young. The first song he learned to play was \"Baby Let Me Follow You Down,\" a song which appeared on Dylan's eponymous debut album. He formed a band named Dead or Alive which quickly disbanded.\nCampbell met Tom Petty through drummer Randall Marsh. Marsh was auditioning to be in Petty's band Mudcrutch and learned that Mudcrutch had recently lost their guitarist. He suggested that Petty try Campbell, who was his roommate and had actually been listening to the conversation in the next room. Campbell impressed Petty with his version of \"Johnny B. Goode\" and was offered a spot in the band. Mudcrutch became a popular act around Gainesville and north Florida in the early 1970s. They relocated to Los Angeles in 1974 and signed a record deal with Shelter Records, but released only one poor-selling single and broke up soon after.\n\n\n== Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers ==\n\nIn 1976, Campbell rejoined Petty to begin Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers with former Mudcrutch member Benmont Tench (keyboards) along with Ron Blair (bass guitar) and Stan Lynch (drums).\nLike the other Heartbreakers, Campbell avoids the virtuoso approach to playing, preferring to have his work serve the needs of each song.\nCampbell co-produced the Heartbreakers albums Southern Accents, Pack Up the Plantation: Live!, Let Me Up (I've Had Enough), Into the Great Wide Open, Songs and Music from \"She's the One\", Echo, The Last DJ, The Live Anthology and Mojo, as well as the Petty solo albums Full Moon Fever, Wildflowers, and Highway Companion. His sole vocal contribution to the group was on the track \"I Don't Wanna Fight\" on Echo.\nCampbell collaborated, recorded, and toured with Tom Petty for almost 50 years. His last live performance with the Heartbreakers was on September 25, 2017, at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. Tom Petty died unexpectedly about one week later, on October 2.\n\n\n== Side projects ==\nIn 1997, Campbell co-founded the Blue Stingrays with Heartbreakers member Ron Blair and Mudcrutch member Randall Marsh, and released their one album the same year.\nIn 2007, he joined a reformed Mudcrutch with Petty, Tench, Marsh, and Tom Leadon\nOld Dan's Records is Canadian singer Gordon Lightfoot's eighth studio album, released in 1972 on the Reprise Records label. The album reached #1 in Canada on the RPM national album chart on November 5, 1972, and remained there for three weeks. In the U.S., it peaked at #95 on the pop chart.\nThe album marks a continued evolution in Lightfoot's sound as he begins to add country influences to his standard folk sound with the help of the banjo, dobro and steel guitar. Lightfoot would continue to use these country influences in his music until the early 1980s.\nDespite its 1972 year of initial release, the album was nominated for and won the 1974 Juno Award for \"Folk Album of the Year\".  Lightfoot also won a Juno that year as \"Folk Singer of the Year\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll compositions by Gordon Lightfoot\n\n\n=== Side 1 ===\n\"Farewell to Annabel\" – 2:59\n\"That Same Old Obsession\" – 3:46\n\"Old Dan's Records\" – 3:05\n\"Lazy Mornin'\" – 3:43\n\"You Are What I Am\" – 2:37\n\n\n=== Side 2 ===\n\"Can't Depend on Love\" – 3:12\n\"My Pony Won't Go\" – 3:50\n\"It's Worth Believin'\" – 3:24\n\"Mother of a Miner's Child\" – 3:18\n\"Hi'way Songs\" – 3:37\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nGordon Lightfoot - vocals, guitar, vibraphone\nRed Shea - lead guitar, classical guitar, Dobro\nTerry Clements - lead guitar\nRick Haynes - bass\nBarry Keane - drums, percussion\nDave Brown - percussion\nBruce Good - autoharp\nLarry Good - 5-string banjo\nDavid Bromberg - slide Dobro (\"My Pony Won't Go\")\nNick De Caro - piano, orchestral arrangements\nOllie Strong - steel guitar\nTechnical\nLee Herschberg - engineer\nEd Thrasher - art direction\nJohn Reeves - photography\n\"Special thanks to Bill Richards and Guido Basso and members of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlbum lyrics and chords\nWarner Music Group Corp., commonly abbreviated as WMG, is an American multinational entertainment and record label conglomerate headquartered in New York City. It is one of the \"big three\" recording companies and the third-largest in the global music industry, after Universal Music Group (UMG) and Sony Music Entertainment (SME). Formerly part of Time Warner (later known as WarnerMedia, now Warner Bros. Discovery), WMG was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange from 2005 until 2011, when it announced its privatization and sale to Access Industries. It later had its second IPO on Nasdaq in 2020, once again becoming a public company. With a multibillion-dollar annual turnover, WMG employs more than 4,500 people and has operations in more than 50 countries throughout the world.\nThe company owns and operates some of the largest and most successful labels in the world, including Elektra Records, Reprise Records, Warner Records, Parlophone Records (previously owned by EMI), and Atlantic Records. WMG also owns Warner Chappell Music, one of the world's largest music publishers.\nSince August 2, 2018, WMG has expanded its business to digital media operations through its acquisition of Uproxx.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1950s and 1960s ===\nThe film studio Warner Bros. had no record label division at the time one of its contracted actors, Tab Hunter, scored a No. 1 hit song in 1957 for Dot Records, a division of rival Paramount Pictures. In order to prevent any repetition of its actors recording for rival companies, and to also capitalize on the music business, Warner Bros. Records was created in 1958; its original office was located above the film studio's machine shop on 3701 Warner Boulevard in Burbank, California. In 1963, Warner purchased Reprise Records, which had been founded by Frank Sinatra three years earlier so that he could have more creative control over his recordings. With the Reprise acquisition, Warner gained the services of Mo Ostin, who was mainly responsible for the success of Warner/Reprise.\nAfter Warner Bros. was sold to Seven Arts Productions in 1967 (forming Warner Bros.-Seven Arts), it purchased Atlantic Records, founded in 1947 and WMG's oldest label (until WMG completed its acquisition of Parlophone in 2013), as well as its subsidiary Atco Records. This acquisition brought Neil Young into the company fold, initially as a member of Buffalo Springfield. Young became one of Warner's longest-established artists, recording both as a solo artist and with groups under the Warner-owned Atlantic, Atco, and Reprise labels. Young also recorded five albums for Geffen Records during that label's period of Warner distribution. The Geffen catalogue, now owned by Universal Music Group, represents Young's only major recordings not under WMG ownership.\nAtlantic, its subsidiary Atco Records, and its affiliate Stax Records paved the way for Warner's rise to industry prominence. The purchase brought in Atlantic's lucrative back catalogue, which included classic recordings by Ray Charles, the Drifters, the Coasters, and many more. In the mid-1960s, Atlantic/Stax released a string of landmark soul music recordings by artists including Booker T & the MGs, Sam & Dave, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, Ben E. King, and Aretha Franklin. Ultimately, the sale led to Stax leaving Atlantic because Seven Arts Productions insisted on keeping the rights to Stax recordings. Atlantic moved decisively into rock and pop in the late 1960s and 1970s, signing major British and American acts including Led Zeppelin, Cream, Crosby Stills & Nash, Yes, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Genesis, Average White Band, Dr. John, King Crimson, Bette Midler, Roxy Music, and Foreigner.\nIn 1969, two years after being purchased by Seven Arts, the Warner Bros.-Seven Arts company was sold to the Kinney National Company. In mid-1972, Kinney Music of Canada, Ltd. was renamed WEA Music of Canada, Ltd. (French: WEA Musique du Canada, Ltée) as the Canadian branch of the WEA (Warner, El\nJune Elizabeth Millington (born April 14, 1948) is a Filipina-American guitarist, songwriter, producer, educator, and actress. \nMillington was the founder of the music groups the Svelts and Wild Honey, before becoming co-founder and lead guitarist of the all-female rock band Fanny, which was active from 1970 to 1974. Millington has been called \"a godmother of women's music\", and is the co-founder and artistic director of the Institute for the Musical Arts (IMA) in Goshen, Massachusetts.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJune Elizabeth Millington was born in Manila, the Philippines, on April 14, 1948, the eldest of the seven children of Filipina socialite \"Yola\" Yolanda Leonor Limjoco Millington (born February 10, 1922, in Lian, Batangas, the Philippines; died December 19, 2002, in California, U.S.), and former United States Navy Lt. Commander John \"Jack\" Howard Millington (born September 18, 1915, in Burlington, Vermont; died June 24, 1980, in Bristol, Vermont). He had graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1939, and was a son of Professor Howard G. Millington, a noted folklorist. June Millington's parents were married in Manila in May 1947, and divorced in California in March 1970. Millington is the older sister of bassist Jean Y. Millington Adamian (born May 25, 1949, in Manila), Richard J. Millington, Stephen H. Millington, James E. Millington, David S. Millington, and Sylvia F. G. Millington Lyons.\n\n\n=== Philippines ===\nJack and Yola Millington and their children lived luxuriously  with Yola's parents Angel Limjoco and Felisa Limjoco (née Lejano) in various Manila locations until they moved to the United States in 1961, including at 56 R. Pascual Street, San Juan (then part of Rizal province); in the Wack Wack Golf and Country Club in Mandaluyong; near the old American School in Pasay; and on N. Domingo Street, San Juan; and for several months just before they emigrated at the Howell Compound in Quezon City. Additionally, during 1953, Millington and her family lived for a year in Baguio with her grandparents.\nAt the age of eight, Millington began playing piano to entertain her family, and later listened to music on the radio and attempted to play along on ukulele. Her family encouraged her to sing and play ukulele at gatherings.\nMillington and her siblings attended The American School, then located in Donada Street in Pasay in Manila, where she later recalled: \"the racism we encountered at the American School was crushing.\" By 1960 Millington transferred to the Assumption Convent school located in Makati, Metro Manila. Early in 1961, when Millington was in the seventh grade, she heard a girl play the guitar, which jump-started her interest in the instrument.\nOn her 13th birthday, Millington was given a small, hand-made, mother-of-pearl inlaid guitar by her mother.\n\n\n=== United States ===\nThree weeks later, in May 1961, the Millington family left the Philippines for the United States on the SS President Cleveland. While on board ship, Millington switched from playing the ukulele to acoustic guitar. On June 22, 1961, the Millington family arrived in the U.S., and then settled in Sacramento, California.\nMillington recalled: \"We always felt like \"other\", never quite fitting in, both in Manila and Sacramento. Being both biracial and bicultural was a really really tough slot in the '50s into the '60s, our formative teenage years.\" In an attempt to become more popular and make friends, in 1962, Millington and her sister Jean wrote their first song \"Angel in White\", followed by \"Miss Wallflower '62\", which they sang with two other girls on their ukuleles at their junior high school variety show. Millington recalled that afterwards, \"Kids started coming up to us and telling us they liked it. So it dawned on us this was a way to make friends.\" In 1962, Millington and her sister Jean began to sing folk songs together as an acoustic duo at hootenannies and similar events, including the songs of Peter, Paul and Mary and other artists featu\nFrancis Albert Sinatra (; December 12, 1915 – May 14, 1998) was an American singer and actor. Nicknamed the \"Chairman of the Board\" and later called \"Ol' Blue Eyes,\" he is regarded as one of the most popular entertainers of the mid-20th century. Sinatra is among the world's best-selling music artists, with an estimated 150 million record sales globally.\nBorn to Italian immigrants in Hoboken, New Jersey, Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era and was greatly influenced by the easy-listening vocal style of Bing Crosby. He found success as a solo artist after signing with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the \"bobby soxers\". In 1946, Sinatra released his debut album, The Voice of Frank Sinatra. He then signed with Capitol Records and released several albums with  arrangements by Nelson Riddle, notably In the Wee Small Hours (1955) and Songs for Swingin' Lovers! (1956). In 1960, Sinatra left Capitol Records to start his own record label, Reprise Records, releasing a string of successful albums. He collaborated with Count Basie on Sinatra-Basie: An Historic Musical First (1962) and It Might as Well Be Swing (1964). In 1965, he recorded the retrospective album September of My Years and starred in the Emmy-winning television special Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music. After releasing Sinatra at the Sands in early 1966, Sinatra recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Tom Jobim, Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim. It was followed by 1968's Francis A. & Edward K. with Duke Ellington. Sinatra retired in 1971 following the release of \"My Way\" but came out of retirement two years later. He recorded several albums and released \"New York, New York\" in 1980.\nSinatra also forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for From Here to Eternity (1953), he starred in The Man with the Golden Arm (1955) and The Manchurian Candidate (1962). Sinatra also appeared in musicals such as On the Town (1949), Guys and Dolls (1955), High Society (1956), and Pal Joey (1957), which won him a Golden Globe Award. Toward the end of his career, he frequently played detectives, including the title character in Tony Rome (1967). Sinatra received the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1971. On television, The Frank Sinatra Show began on CBS in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s.\nIn 1983, Sinatra was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1985 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. Sinatra received eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award, and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He was included in Time magazine's compilation of the 20th century's 100 most influential people. American music critic Robert Christgau called him \"the greatest singer of the 20th century\" and he continues to be regarded as an iconic figure.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nFrancis Albert Sinatra was born on December 12, 1915, in a tenement at 415 Monroe Street in Hoboken, New Jersey, the only child of Italian immigrants Natalina \"Dolly\" Garaventa and Antonino Martino \"Marty\" Sinatra, who boxed under the name Marty O'Brien. Sinatra weighed 13.5 pounds (6.1 kg) at birth and had to be delivered with the aid of forceps, which caused severe scarring to his left cheek, neck, and ear, and perforated his eardrum—which remained damaged for the rest of his life. His grandmother resuscitated him by running her grandson under cold water until he gasped his first breath. Due to his injuries, his baptism at St. Francis Church in Hoboken was delayed until April 2, 1916. A childhood operation on his mastoid bone left major scarring on his neck, and during adolescence he was further scarred by cystic acne. Sinatra was raised in the Catholic Church.\nSinatra's mother was energetic and driven; biographers believe that she was the dominant factor in the development of\nDwight David Yoakam (born October 23, 1956) is an American country singer-songwriter, actor, and filmmaker. He first achieved mainstream attention in 1986 with the release of his debut album Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.. Yoakam had considerable success throughout the late 1980s onward, with a total of ten studio albums for Reprise Records. Later projects have been released on Audium (now MNRK Music Group), New West, Warner, and Sugar Hill Records.\nHis first three albums—Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc., Hillbilly Deluxe, and Buenas Noches from a Lonely Room—all reached number one on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. Yoakam also has two number-one singles on Hot Country Songs with \"Streets of Bakersfield\" (a duet with Buck Owens) and \"I Sang Dixie\", and twelve additional top-ten hits. He has won two Grammy Awards and one Academy of Country Music award. 1993's This Time is his most commercially successful album, having been certified triple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\nYoakam's musical style draws from a wide variety of influences including alternative country, neotraditional country, honky-tonk, rock, and the Bakersfield sound. He is known for his distinctive tenor singing voice, unconventional musical image, and the lead guitar work of his longtime producer and bandleader Pete Anderson. Yoakam writes most of his own songs but has recorded many successful cover songs by a wide range of artists including Johnny Horton, Elvis Presley, Cheap Trick, The Blasters, Lefty Frizzell, and Queen. He has collaborated with Beck, John Mellencamp, k.d. lang, Ralph Stanley, and members of Alison Krauss & Union Station.\nAs an actor, Yoakam has appeared in the movies Red Rock West, Sling Blade, Panic Room, The Minus Man, and Wedding Crashers, as well as South of Heaven, West of Hell, which he wrote and directed. He also appeared in the TV series P.S. I Luv U and Under the Dome, as well as the Amazon Prime Video original series Goliath.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nDwight David Yoakam was born October 23, 1956, in Pikeville, Kentucky. He is the eldest of three children to Ruth (née Tibbs) and David Yoakam. At the time of Yoakam's birth, his father was serving in the United States Army. After David Yoakam was discharged from the Army, the Yoakams moved to Columbus, Ohio. By this point the couple had a second son named Ronald and a daughter named Kimberly. Meanwhile, David supported his family by working at a Westinghouse Electric Corporation factory and later by ownership of a Texaco gas station. Yoakam's father had acquired a guitar manufactured by the Kay Musical Instrument Company while in the Army, and gave it to Yoakam after being unable to learn to play it himself. Although Yoakam later broke this guitar, he received another one as a Christmas present while he was in the fourth grade. He also wrote his first song around this point. As a child, Yoakam took influence from the music that his parents listened to on records as well as WMNI, then an AM country music radio station in Columbus. Among these records were compilations by Johnny Cash and Johnny Horton. According to his mother, the family would also sing songs to each other when on road trips to visit Yoakam's maternal grandparents. Yoakam himself also stated that he was influenced by rock and roll acts he had seen on television, such as Elvis Presley.\nThe Yoakam family moved to another neighborhood of Columbus in 1968, where Yoakam attended Northland High School. His mother encouraged all three of her children to join the school's band, in which Yoakam played drums. He also attended drama class at Northland High School, which led to him playing the role of Charlie in a production of Flowers for Algernon. Yoakam later attributed this performance as giving him more confidence performing in front of others. In his senior year of high school, Yoakam and some classmates formed a rock and roll band to compete in the school's talent show. The band became popula\nMichael Steven Bublé  (IPA:  boo-BLAY; born September 9, 1975) is a Canadian singer and songwriter. Born in Burnaby, British Columbia, he is often credited for helping to renew public interest and appreciation for traditional pop standards and the Great American Songbook. Bublé has sold over 75 million records worldwide, and won numerous awards, including five Grammy Awards and fifteen Juno Awards.\nIn 2003, Bublé's first album reached the top ten in Canada and the United Kingdom. He found a worldwide audience with his 2005 album It's Time and his 2007 album Call Me Irresponsible – which reached number one on the Canadian Albums Chart, the UK Albums Chart, the US Billboard 200, the Australian ARIA Albums Chart and several European charts. His 2009 album Crazy Love debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 after three days of sales, and remained there for two weeks. It was also his fourth number-one album on Billboard's Top Jazz Albums chart. His 2011 holiday album, Christmas, was in first place on the Billboard 200 for the final four weeks of 2011 and the first week of 2012, totalling five weeks atop the chart, it also made the top 5 in the United Kingdom. With this, Christmas became his third-consecutive number-one album on the chart. To Be Loved was released in April 2013, followed by Nobody but Me in October 2016 and Love in November 2018.\n\n\n== Early life and musical beginnings ==\nMichael Steven Bublé was born in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada, on September 9, 1975, the son of Lewis Bublé, a fisherman, and Amber (née Santaga), a homemaker. Bublé's paternal and maternal great-grandparents immigrated to Canada from Italy. His surname was originally spelled \"Bubli\", and some of his paternal ancestors came from Istria. Bublé stated: \"[On the side of the family native to modern-day Croatia] some say we're Yugoslavian, others that we're Italian.\" He has two younger sisters, Brandee, a children's book author, and Crystal, an actress. He and his siblings were raised Roman Catholic. He attended Seaforth Elementary School and Cariboo Hill Secondary School.\nAccording to an Oprah Winfrey interview on October 10, 2009, Bublé dreamed of becoming a famous singer since he was two. When he was a teenager, he slept with his Bible and prayed to become a singer. His interest in jazz began at around age five when his family played Bing Crosby's White Christmas album. His musical influences include Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Tony Bennett, Elvis Presley, Bobby Darin and Sam Cooke.\nThe first time his family noticed his singing talent was during the Christmas holidays, when Bublé was 13 years old, and they heard him powerfully sing the phrase \"May your days be merry and bright\" when the family was singing to the song \"White Christmas\" on a car ride.\nBublé also has a strong passion for ice hockey and wanted to become a professional hockey player for the Vancouver Canucks growing up, but believed he was not good enough. \"I wanted so bad to be a hockey player... If I was any good at hockey, I probably wouldn't be singing right now.\" He often played hockey in his youth, watched Vancouver Canucks games with his father, and said that he \"went to every single home game as a kid... I remember I wanted to be Gary Lupul, I wanted to be Patrik Sundstrom and Ivan Hlinka. I used to think that being named Michael Bublé was pretty cool because I was close to being called Jiri Bubla.\" Bublé shared his hockey interest with his grandfather.\nFrom the age of 14, Bublé spent six years working during the summer as a commercial fisherman with his father and crewmates. He called the experience \"the most deadly physical work I'll ever know in my lifetime. We'd be gone for two, sometimes three months at a time and the experience of living and working among guys over twice my age taught me a lot about responsibility and what it means to be a man.\"\nHis first singing engagements were in nightclubs at age 16 and were facilitated by his Italian grandfather Demetrio Santag\nReprise Please Baby: The Warner Bros. Years is a 2002 box set of songs by American country musician Dwight Yoakam, highlighting his career on Reprise Records and Warner Bros. Records, along with his initial 1981 demos and two new tracks. It has received positive reviews from critics.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nWriting for The A. V. Club, Stephen Thompson stated that this compilation \"has more than settled any arguments about Yoakam's rightful place in modern country's canon\" by including material from his \"fine\" 1980s releases as well as the musician's \"immensely satisfying but lesser-known '90s catalog\". Editors at AllMusic rated this album 5 out of 5 stars, with critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing that \"on Rhino's excellent four-disc box set\" Yoakam's influence on country music is display with \"a superb chronicling of his time at Reprise/Warner Records\" that \"doesn't focus simply on the hits\", adding up to music that is \"all necessary to understanding Yoakam's music and his influence\". Jim Caligiuri of The Austin Chronicle also rated this box set 5 out of 5 stars, characterizing it as \"a testament to a talent unmatched in many ways\" and \"a marvelous first chapter in a career that shows no signs of slowing down\". In a brief overview of box sets released at the end of 2002, Neil Strauss stated that the best part of Reprise Please Baby: The Warner Bros. Years was the fourth disc of previously unreleased studio and live material and continued that \"in this set, one can hear [Yoakam']s stubborn traditionalism and his innate eclecticism intertwine as two decades roll by\".

Payne (born March 12, 1949, in Waco, Texas) is an American pianist who, with Lowell George, co-founded the American rock band Little Feat. He is considered by many other rock pianists, including Elton John, to be one of the finest American piano rock and blues musicians. In addition to his trademark barrelhouse blues piano, he is noted for his work on the Hammond B3 organ. Payne is an accomplished songwriter whose credits include \"Oh, Atlanta\". Following the death of Little Feat drummer Richie Hayward on August 12, 2010, Payne is the only member of the group from the original four-piece line-up currently playing in the band.\nPayne has worked and recorded with J. J. Cale, Jimmy Buffett, Doobie Brothers, Emmylou Harris, Bryan Adams, Pink Floyd, Bob Seger, Toto, Linda Ronstadt, Jackson Browne, Carly Simon, James Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, Helen Watson, Stevie Nicks, Robert Palmer, Richard Torrance, Stephen Bruton, and Shocking Edison. He was a guest performer on Bonnie Raitt's album Sweet Forgiveness in 1977, and wrote its track, \"Takin' My Time.\"\nPaul Barrere and Bill Payne played several live concerts with Phil Lesh and Friends, from October 1999 through July 2000.  Payne was a member of Boulder band Leftover Salmon from 2014 until December 2015.\nIn August 2015, Payne was selected to play keyboards for The Doobie Brothers after their keyboardist Guy Allison was called to work on an album project in Japan. However, in December 2015 Payne rejoined the Doobies as a touring member, officially taking the position previously held by Allison.  In the few weeks of touring with the Doobies, he was featured with the band and Michael McDonald on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.  Payne's temporary term ended in early September after the Doobies' concert at the BB&T Pavilion in Camden, New Jersey.\n\n\n== Other work ==\nPayne was a pioneer in the development of online music communities. In the early 1990s, he contacted his fan base and enlisted the help of friend Jay Herbst to develop the Little Feat Grass-roots Movement. This model went on to be a template for many bands in the creation of their Street Teams, which enlist the help of fans for purposes of music and concert promotion. This method has proven to be an effective vehicle for bringing bands and fans closer together, and forging friendships between them.\nPayne now also works as a commercial photographer.\n\n\n== Songwriting (selected) ==\nPayne wrote or co-wrote many of the songs in Little Feat's catalogue, including the following:\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Little Feat ===\n\n\n=== Solo ===\nCielo Norte (2005)\n\n\n== Collaborations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBill Payne Discography\nLittle Feat website\nSomething Wild (1966)\nCertain Fury O.S.T.

The band has sold over 75 million records worldwide, including more than 26.5 million in certified album sales in the United States. Green Day released their first two studio albums, 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours (1991) (consisting of the original 39/Smooth as well as their first two EPs 1,000 Hours and Slappy) and Kerplunk (1991), through the independent label Lookout! Records before signing to major label Reprise Records. Dookie, the band's first album on the label and third studio album overall, was released in February 1994. It was a breakout success, selling over 10 million copies in the United States and 20 million copies worldwide. Dookie spawned five singles, including the international hits \"Longview\", \"Basket Case\" and \"When I Come Around\". The album placed Green Day at the forefront of the 1990s punk rock revival.\nInsomniac, the band's fourth studio album, was released in October 1995. While not as successful as Dookie, the album managed to peak at number two on the US Billboard 200 and received a double platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Nimrod followed in October 1997; it peaked at number ten on the Billboard 200. Four singles were released from Nimrod; the most successful of these was \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\", which hit the top ten in countries such as Australia and Canada. The band's sixth studio album Warning was released in October 2000 to mild commercial success, peaking at number four on the Billboard 200 and only earning a gold certification from the RIAA.\nTheir seventh studio album American Idiot reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation. Becoming the band's first album to top the Billboard 200, American Idiot sold over seven million copies in the United States, including more than 14 million copies worldwide. The album spawned five commercially successful singles: \"American Idiot\", \"Jesus of Suburbia\", \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", \"Holiday\", and \"Wake Me Up When September Ends\". A Broadway musical was created based on the album.\nThe band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, followed in May 2009, topping the Billboard 200 and being certified double platinum by the RIAA. Two singles from the album—\"Know Your Enemy\" and \"21 Guns\"—became top 40 hits on the US Billboard Hot 100. A trilogy of studio albums—¡Uno!, ¡Dos!, and ¡Tré!—were released toward the end of 2012. ¡Uno!, ¡Dos! and ¡Tré! peaked at numbers two, nine and thirteen, respectively, on the Billboard 200. ¡Uno! received a gold certification from the RIAA.\nIn 2016, another studio album, Revolution Radio, was released and topped the Billboard 200. That album was followed by Father of All Motherfuckers, which was released in 2020 and debuted in the top five of the Billboard 200 and topped the Australian, Canadian and UK charts in its first week. The band released their most recent album, Saviors, in January 2024.\n\n\n== Albums ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n\n\n=== Soundtrack albums ===\n\n\n=== Demo albums ===\n\n\n=== Video albums ===\n\n\n=== Box sets ===\n\n\n== Extended plays ==\n\n\n== Singles ==\n\n\n=== 1990s ===\n\n\n=== 2000s ===\n\n\n=== 2010s ===\n\n\n=== 2020s ===\n\n\n=== Promotional singles ===\n\n\n== Other charted songs ==\n\n\n== Other appearances ==\n\n\n=== Soundtracks ===\nFilms\n\nVideo games\n\n\n== Music videos ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nGreen Day at AllMusic\nGreen Day discography at Discogs\nGreen Day discography at MusicBrainz",

Soon thereafter, he garnered the nickname \"The Chairman of the Board\". Because of dissatisfaction with Capitol Records, and after trying to buy Norman Granz's Verve Records, the first album Sinatra released on Reprise was Ring-a-Ding-Ding! As CEO of Reprise, Sinatra recruited several artists for the fledgling label, such as fellow Rat Pack members Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. The original roster from 1961 to 1963 included Bing Crosby, Jo Stafford, Rosemary Clooney, Duke Ellington, Nancy Sinatra, Esquivel and stand-up comedian Redd Foxx. The original Reprise LP label had four different logos, depending on the genre: a riverboat for Pop records (pictured), a cherub for Jazz records, an owl for Spoken Word/Comedy records, and a picture of Sinatra for his records."

In Martin's case, his Reprise recordings were out of print for nearly 20 years before a deal was struck with Capitol Records.

Many of the older artists on the label were dropped by Warner Bros. Records. Reprise president Mo Ostin was retained as the head of the label and he went on to play a very significant role in the history of the Warner group of labels over the next four decades. Warner-Reprise executives began targeting younger acts, beginning by securing the American distribution rights to the Pye Records recordings by the Kinks in 1964. Reprise soon added teen-oriented pop acts like Dino, Desi & Billy to the roster. As well, Sinatra's own daughter Nancy (who began recording for the label in 1961) was retained by Ostin, becoming a major pop star from late 1965. The label moved almost exclusively to rock-oriented music in the late 1960s, although Frank Sinatra continued to record for the label until the 1980s."

Pictures decided to expand into publishing and recording so that it could access low-cost music content for its films. In 1928, the studio acquired several smaller music publishing firms which included M. Witmark & Sons, Harms Inc., and a partial interest in New World Music Corp., and merged them to form the Music Publishers Holding Company. This new group controlled valuable copyrights on standards by George and Ira Gershwin and Jerome Kern, and the new division was soon earning solid profits of up to US$2 million every year."

Unfortunately for Warner Bros., the dual impact of the Great Depression and the introduction of broadcast radio greatly harmed the recording industry—sales crashed, dropping by around 90% from more than 100 million records in 1927 to fewer than 10 million by 1932 and major companies were forced to halve the price of records from 75 to 35 cents."

Technically, Warner maintained actual ownership of Brunswick, which with the sale of ARC to CBS in 1939 and their decision to discontinue Brunswick in favor of reviving the Columbia label, reverted to Warner Bros. Warner Bros. sold Brunswick a second time (along with Brunswick's back catalog up to 1931) in 1941, this time along with the old Brunswick pressing plants Warner owned, to Decca Records (which formed its American operations in 1934) in exchange for a financial interest in Decca. The heavy loss it incurred in the Brunswick deal kept the studio out of the record business for almost 20 years, and during this period it licensed its film music to other companies for release as soundtrack albums."

Khaury has passionately praised Burr, telling Johnny Carson that \"the wonderful Henry Burr's\" circa-1915 records inspired his own singing style. He would sit for hours listening to the record. At the age of six, he began teaching himself guitar. By his pre-teen years, he developed a passion for records, specifically those from the 1900s through the 1930s. He began spending most of his free time at the New York Public Library, reading about the history of the phonograph industry and its first recording artists. He researched sheet music, often making photographic copies to take home to learn, a hobby he continued for his entire life.

At the time when he started learning drums, he also learned how to play guitar, but growing up with a stepfather (Neil) who played the drums, he took a deeper passion with the drums.

Burton's wife is Louise Burton.\nSelf-taught, Burton began playing guitar during childhood. He was hired to be part of the staff band for the popular Louisiana Hayride radio show in Shreveport. While he was still a teenager, Burton left Shreveport for Los Angeles, where he joined Ricky Nelson's band. There, he made numerous recordings as a session musician. Burton created and played the guitar solo on Dale Hawkins 1957 hit song \"Susie Q\", a record that would become one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.  He had originally written the song as an instrumental before Hawkins wrote lyrics for it; Burton never received credit or royalties for his contributions to \"Susie Q\"."

At this time, Burton was relegated to rhythm as Joe Maphis was still playing lead guitar for Nelson.

His first electric guitar was a $60 Guyatone, but playing a friend's Gibson SG (a model which Campbell would not own himself for many years) was a transformative experience. Like Tom Petty, Campbell drew his strongest influences from The Byrds and Bob Dylan, with additional inspiration coming from guitarists such as Scotty Moore, Luther Perkins, George Harrison, Carl Wilson, Jerry Garcia, Roger McGuinn, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Jimmy Page, Mick Taylor, and Neil Young.

        "content": "Atlantic Recording Corporation (simply known as Atlantic Records) is an American record label founded in October 1947 by Ahmet Ertegun and Herb Abramson. Over the course of its first two decades, starting from the release of its first recordings in January 1948, Atlantic earned a reputation as one of the most important American labels, specializing in jazz, R&B, and soul by Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett, Sam and Dave, Ruth Brown and Otis Redding. Its position was greatly improved by its distribution deal with Stax. In 1967, Atlantic became a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, now the Warner Music Group, and expanded into rock and pop music with releases by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Led Zeppelin, and Yes.\nIn 2004, Atlantic and its sister label Elektra were merged into the Atlantic Records Group. Craig Kallman is the chairman of Atlantic. Ahmet Ertegun served as founding chairman until his death on December 14, 2006, at age 83.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding and early history ===\nIn 1944, brothers Nesuhi and Ahmet Ertegun remained in the United States when their mother and sister returned to Turkey after the death of their father Munir Ertegun, Turkey's first ambassador to the U.S. The brothers were fans of jazz and rhythm & blues, amassing a collection of over 15,000 78 RPM records. Ahmet ostensibly stayed in Washington to undertake post-graduate music studies at Georgetown University but immersed himself in the Washington music scene and entered the record business, which was enjoying a resurgence after wartime restrictions on the shellac used in manufacture. He convinced the family dentist, Vahdi Sabit, to invest $10,000 and hired Herb Abramson, a dentistry student.\nAbramson had worked as a part-time A&R manager/producer for Al Green at the jazz label National Records, signing Big Joe Turner and Billy Eckstine. He founded Jubilee in 1946 but had no interest in its most successful musicians. In September 1947, he sold his share in Jubilee to his partner, Jerry Blaine, and invested $2,500 in Atlantic.\nAtlantic was incorporated in October 1947 and was run by Abramson (president) and Ertegun (vice-president in charge of A&R, production, and promotion). Abramson's wife Miriam ran the label's publishing company, Progressive Music, and did most office duties until 1949 when Atlantic hired its first employee, bookkeeper Francine Wakschal, who remained with the label for the next 49 years. Miriam gained a reputation for toughness. Staff engineer Tom Dowd recalled, \"Tokyo Rose was the kindest name some people had for her\" and Doc Pomus described her as \"an extraordinarily vitriolic woman\". When interviewed in 2009, she attributed her reputation to the company's chronic cash-flow shortage: \"... most of the problems we had with artists were that they wanted advances, and that was very difficult for us ... we were undercapitalized for a long time.\" The label's office in the Ritz Hotel in Manhattan proved too expensive, so they moved to a room in the Hotel Jefferson. In the early fifties, Atlantic moved from the Hotel Jefferson to offices at 301 West 54th St and then to 356 West 56th St.\nAtlantic's first recordings were issued in late January 1948 and included \"That Old Black Magic\" by Tiny Grimes and \"The Spider\" by Joe Morris. In its early years, Atlantic concentrated on modern jazz although it released some country and western and spoken word recordings. Abramson also produced \"Magic Records\", children's records with four grooves on each side, each groove containing a different story, so the story played would be determined by the groove in which the stylus happened to land.\nIn late 1947, James Petrillo, head of the American Federation of Musicians, announced an indefinite ban on all recording activities by union musicians, and this came into effect on January 1, 1948. The union action forced Atlantic to use almost all its capital to cut and stockpile enough recordings to last through the ban, which w\nAtlantic Music Group LLC is an umbrella label owned by Warner Music Group. It oversees several labels assigned to its Atlantic Records unit. In total, the label group has nearly three hundred artists on its roster.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2004, Time Warner sold Warner Music to a group of private investors. As a cost-cutting maneuver, the new owners of Warner Music Group merged Atlantic Records with its sister, Elektra Records, to form The Atlantic Records Group. Upon the merger, Elektra became largely dormant, with most of its retained roster absorbed by Atlantic.  In the years to follow, Atlantic Records Group would add a host of other labels to its umbrella, including: Roadrunner Records, Fueled by Ramen, Custard Records and Maybach Music Group. Elektra was reactivated as a brand of Atlantic Records Group in 2009. The same year Atlantic's dance and hip hop imprint Big Beat Records, which scored notable success for most of the 1990s (but had been in hibernation since 1998) was also relaunched.\nOn June 18, 2018,  Warner Music Group announced the formation of Elektra Music Group to be launched as a stand-alone, independently managed primary label at WMG on October 1.  Splitting off from Atlantic Records Group, EMG will take with it five labels that previously operated under the Atlantic group (including Elektra Records), three label staff, and a handful of major artists. Elektra's independence renews the WEA (Warner-Elektra-Atlantic) triad that had for decades mark the original company organization. Elektra co-presidents, however, will answer to Atlantic Records Group Chairman/CEO Craig Kallman and Chairman/COO Julie Greenwald.\nIn 2020, Atlantic Records announced the relaunching of its original subsidiary label Atco Records, under the authority of its A&R President Pete Ganbarg. This reactivation of Atco Records marks the first time in over 25 years that the label has actively operated under the Atlantic Records umbrella.\n\n\n== Labels ==\nAvang Music\nAsylum Records\nAtco Records\nAtlantic Records\nBig Beat Records\nCustard Records\nFNC Entertainment\nHitmaker Records\nLaSalle Records\nMaybach Music Group\nOwsla\nUpFront Records\nX5 Music Group\nTaylor Gang Records\nGeneration Now\n10K Projects\n\n\n== Atlantic Records UK ==\n\nAtlantic Records UK is a British record label used as copyright-holder for UK releases on the Atlantic label. It was founded in June 2004 when Warner Music Group bought East West Records from Time Warner and rebranded its UK operation. The first Chairman was Max Lousada, previously Head of A&R at Mushroom Records UK and, as of June 2019, chairman and CEO Warner Music UK. In 2011 Atlantic Records UK was named Label of the Year at the Music Week Awards. In the same year, The Guardian put Lousada joint 20th in its \"Music Power 100\" list of influential figures in the UK music industry. He shared his place with John Reid and Christian Tattersfield, both from Warner. In October 2011, the7stars advertising agency announced it had won a pitch to handle Atlantic Records UK's £2 million media planning and buying account, taking over from ZenithOptimedia. In 2014, Ben Cook was appointed president, Atlantic Records UK, reporting to Lousada. In 2019, the label was reconfigured around A&R, Promotions, Marketing, Publicity, Creative and Audience.\nBy 2010, their artists included Flo Rida, Jay-Z, T.I., Lupe Fiasco, B.o.B, Missy Elliott and Plan B and by 2014 the list included Paolo Nutini, Ed Sheeran, Birdy, Rudimental, Marina and the Diamonds, Rumer, Twenty One Pilots, Lykke Li, Santigold and Clean Bandit.

Retrieve\nAs of May 2024, there have been 1,727 tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity, 960 at hurricane intensity, and 333 at major hurricane intensity within the Atlantic Ocean since 1851, the first Atlantic hurricane season to be included in the official Atlantic tropical cyclone record. Though a majority of these cyclones have fallen within climatological averages, prevailing atmospheric conditions occasionally lead to anomalous tropical systems which at times reach extremes in statistical record-keeping including in duration and intensity. The scope of this list is limited to tropical cyclone records solely within the Atlantic Ocean and is subdivided by their reason for notability.\n\n\n== Tropical cyclogenesis ==\n\n\n=== Most active / least active Atlantic hurricane seasons ===\nMost Atlantic hurricane seasons prior to the weather satellite era include seven or fewer recorded tropical storms or hurricanes. As the usage of satellite data was not available until the mid-1960s, early storm counts are less reliable. Before the advent of the airplane or means of tracking storms, the ones recorded were storms that affected mainly populated areas. An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910 has been estimated.\nWith the advent of the satellite came better and more accurate weather tracking. The first satellites sent into space to monitor the weather were known as Television Infrared Observation Satellites (TIROS). In 1961, Hurricane Esther was the first hurricane to be \"discovered\" through satellite readings. Although this modern invention was now available, the systems were initially not fully active enough to provide daily images of the storms. Data for the North Atlantic region remained sparse as late as 1964 due to a lack of complete satellite coverage.\nDue to the above factors, terms such as \"ever\" or \"on record\" should be interpreted to mean \"since sometime between 1964 and 1978\".\nThe most active Atlantic hurricane season on record in terms of total storms took place in 2020, with 30 documented. The storm count for the 2020 season also includes fourteen hurricanes, of which seven strengthened to major hurricane status. On the converse, the least active season on record in terms of total storms took place in 1914. The 1914 season had just one tropical storm and no hurricanes.\n\n\n=== Earliest / latest formations for each category ===\n\nClimatologically speaking, approximately 97 percent of tropical cyclones that form in the North Atlantic develop between June 1 and November 30 – dates which delimit the modern-day Atlantic hurricane season. Though the beginning of the annual hurricane season has historically remained the same, the official end of the hurricane season has shifted from its initial date of October 31. Regardless, on average once every few years a tropical cyclone develops outside the limits of the season; as of 2023 there have been 92 tropical cyclones in the off-season, with the most recent being an unnamed subtropical storm in January 2023. The first tropical cyclone of the 1938 Atlantic hurricane season, which formed on January 3, became the earliest forming tropical storm and hurricane after reanalysis concluded on the storm in December 2012. Hurricane Able in 1951 was initially thought to be the earliest forming major hurricane; however, following post-storm analysis, it was determined that Able only reached Category 1 strength, which made Hurricane Alma of 1966 the new record holder, as it became a major hurricane on June 8. Though it developed within the bounds of the Atlantic hurricane season, Hurricane Audrey in 1957 was the earliest developing Category 4 hurricane on record after it reached the intensity on June 27. However, reanalysis of 1956 to 1960 by NOAA downgraded Audrey to a Category 3, making Hurricane Dennis of 2005 the earliest Category 4 on record in the calendar year on July 8, 2005. That mark stood until s\nThis is a list of artists who record, or who have recorded, for Atlantic Records. a division of Warner Music Group.

Two of the major series of LP recordings were the \"1200\" and \"8000\" series, started by Nesuhi Ertegun. The \"1200\" series was reserved for jazz albums. The \"8000\" and subsequent series, started shortly after the 1200 in 1956, featured Atlantic's R&B and pop albums; when the \"1200\" series was discontinued in the 1970s, the jazz albums were mixed with the R&B and pop albums in their respective series. This list includes albums using Atlantic's numbering system that were released under their numerous subsidiary labels. There is a section containing albums related to the label as well.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== 100 & 400 10-inch LP Series ===\nAtlantic's first 33⅓ RPM LP records were 10-inch albums and their first release in 1949 was a recording of Walter Benton's poetry set to music which was also issued as three 12 inch 78 RPM records. This was followed by two albums in 1950 with the bulk of Atlantic's 10-inch albums released between 1951 and 1953. The 100 Series released mainly instrumental jazz LPs and the 400 Series featured vocalists. The album catalog numbers were often denoted by the prefix \"LP\" on the album cover and \"ALS\" or \"ALR\" on the record label.\n\n\n=== The 1200 – 1700 series ===\nAtlantic commenced releasing 12 inch LP records with the establishment of their 1200 series in 1949 with an album consisting of three 78 RPM records of Walter Benton's poetry. This was followed by a two record set of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet in 1951. Subsequent releases featured Dixieland, opera and selections from Broadway musicals before Nesuhi Ertegun took over responsibility for the LP series in 1955 and the series focused almost exclusively on jazz releases. After one a very early experiment in 1953 stereo releases of Atlantic LPs began production in 1958 and by 1960 all releases were available in mono or stereo pressings—indicated by the prefix SD on the catalog number. The series continued until late 1977 when it concluded with SD 1700 and most of the popular jazz artists moved to the SD 18100 Series and a limited number of albums were released on the 8800 Series.\n\n\n==== 1200 series ====\n\n\n==== 1300 series ====\n\n\n==== 1400 series ====\n\n\n==== 1500 series ====\n\n\n==== 1600 series ====\n\n\n=== 8800 series ===\n\n\n=== 3000 series ===\nA small run of eight jazz LPs released between 1965 and 1967.\n\n\n=== 8000 \"Popular\" Series ===\nAtlantic commenced releasing 12-inch LPs of popular music in 1956 with the 8000 Series collections of hit singles by their roster of established rhythm and blues artists. The 1960s saw the expansion of Atlantic's roster with the addition of popular music performers, international artists and the emerging dominance of soul music singers such as Solomon Burke and Aretha Franklin. By the end of the 1960s the label experienced its greatest commercial success breaking rock music supergroups like Led Zeppelin and Crosby, Stills & Nash.\n\n\n=== 7200–7311 ===\nSD-7200 – Déjà Vu – Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young [1970]\nSD-7201 – Led Zeppelin III – Led Zeppelin [1970]\nSD-7202 – Stephen Stills – Stephen Stills [1970]\nSD-7203 – If I Could Only Remember My Name – David Crosby [1971]\nSD-7204 – Songs For Beginners – Graham Nash [1971]\nSD-7205 – Live At Fillmore West – Aretha Franklin [1971]\nSD-7206 – Stephen Stills 2 – Stephen Stills [1971]\nSD-7207 – Soul To Soul – Various Artists [1971]\nSD-7208 – Led Zeppelin IV (Untitled) – Led Zeppelin [1971]\nSD-7209 – The Way to Become the Sensuous Woman By \"J\" – Tony Camillo [1971]\nSD-7210 – All In the Family (TV Soundtrack) – Carroll O'Connor and Others [1971]\nSD-7211 – Fragile – Yes [1971]\nSD-7212 – Islands – King Crimson [1972]\nSD-7213 – Young, Gifted and Black – Aretha Franklin [1972]\nLD-7214 – FM and AM – George Carlin [1972] The label on this album is Little David Records.\nSD-7215 – Good Ol' Boys – Harold Griffiths [1/72]\nSD-7216 – Roberta \nWarner Music Group Corp., commonly abbreviated as WMG, is an American multinational entertainment and record label conglomerate headquartered in New York City. It is one of the \"big three\" recording companies and the third-largest in the global music industry, after Universal Music Group (UMG) and Sony Music Entertainment (SME). Formerly part of Time Warner (later known as WarnerMedia, now Warner Bros. Discovery), WMG was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange from 2005 until 2011, when it announced its privatization and sale to Access Industries. It later had its second IPO on Nasdaq in 2020, once again becoming a public company. With a multibillion-dollar annual turnover, WMG employs more than 4,500 people and has operations in more than 50 countries throughout the world.\nThe company owns and operates some of the largest and most successful labels in the world, including Elektra Records, Reprise Records, Warner Records, Parlophone Records (previously owned by EMI), and Atlantic Records. WMG also owns Warner Chappell Music, one of the world's largest music publishers.\nSince August 2, 2018, WMG has expanded its business to digital media operations through its acquisition of Uproxx.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1950s and 1960s ===\nThe film studio Warner Bros. had no record label division at the time one of its contracted actors, Tab Hunter, scored a No. 1 hit song in 1957 for Dot Records, a division of rival Paramount Pictures. In order to prevent any repetition of its actors recording for rival companies, and to also capitalize on the music business, Warner Bros. Records was created in 1958; its original office was located above the film studio's machine shop on 3701 Warner Boulevard in Burbank, California. In 1963, Warner purchased Reprise Records, which had been founded by Frank Sinatra three years earlier so that he could have more creative control over his recordings. With the Reprise acquisition, Warner gained the services of Mo Ostin, who was mainly responsible for the success of Warner/Reprise.\nAfter Warner Bros. was sold to Seven Arts Productions in 1967 (forming Warner Bros.-Seven Arts), it purchased Atlantic Records, founded in 1947 and WMG's oldest label (until WMG completed its acquisition of Parlophone in 2013), as well as its subsidiary Atco Records. This acquisition brought Neil Young into the company fold, initially as a member of Buffalo Springfield. Young became one of Warner's longest-established artists, recording both as a solo artist and with groups under the Warner-owned Atlantic, Atco, and Reprise labels. Young also recorded five albums for Geffen Records during that label's period of Warner distribution. The Geffen catalogue, now owned by Universal Music Group, represents Young's only major recordings not under WMG ownership.\nAtlantic, its subsidiary Atco Records, and its affiliate Stax Records paved the way for Warner's rise to industry prominence. The purchase brought in Atlantic's lucrative back catalogue, which included classic recordings by Ray Charles, the Drifters, the Coasters, and many more. In the mid-1960s, Atlantic/Stax released a string of landmark soul music recordings by artists including Booker T & the MGs, Sam & Dave, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, Ben E. King, and Aretha Franklin. Ultimately, the sale led to Stax leaving Atlantic because Seven Arts Productions insisted on keeping the rights to Stax recordings. Atlantic moved decisively into rock and pop in the late 1960s and 1970s, signing major British and American acts including Led Zeppelin, Cream, Crosby Stills & Nash, Yes, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Genesis, Average White Band, Dr. John, King Crimson, Bette Midler, Roxy Music, and Foreigner.\nIn 1969, two years after being purchased by Seven Arts, the Warner Bros.-Seven Arts company was sold to the Kinney National Company. In mid-1972, Kinney Music of Canada, Ltd. was renamed WEA Music of Canada, Ltd. (French: WEA Musique du Canada, Ltée) as the Canadian branch of the WEA (Warner, El\nWarner Records Inc. (known as Warner Bros. Records Inc. until 2019) is an American record label.  A subsidiary of the Warner Music Group, it is headquartered in Los Angeles, California. It was founded on March 19, 1958, as the recorded music division of the American film studio Warner Bros.\nArtists who have recorded for Warner Records include  Madonna, Prince, Linkin Park, Zach Bryan, Van Halen, Kylie Minogue, ZZ Top, Gorillaz, Bette Midler, Grateful Dead, Jane's Addiction, Duran Duran, Fleetwood Mac, Rod Stewart, Funkadelic, James Taylor,  Red Hot Chili Peppers, Mac Miller, R.E.M., Bob James, David Sanborn, and the Sex Pistols.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\nAt the end of the silent movie period, Warner Bros. Pictures decided to expand into publishing and recording so that it could access low-cost music content for its films. In 1928, the studio acquired several smaller music publishing firms which included M. Witmark & Sons, Harms Inc., and a partial interest in New World Music Corp., and merged them to form the Music Publishers Holding Company. This new group controlled valuable copyrights on standards by George and Ira Gershwin and Jerome Kern, and the new division was soon earning solid profits of up to US$2 million every year.\nIn 1930, Music Publishers Holding Company (MPHC) paid US$28 million to acquire Brunswick Records (which included Vocalion), whose roster included Duke Ellington, Red Nichols, Nick Lucas, Al Jolson, Earl Burtnett, Ethel Waters, Abe Lyman, Leroy Carr, Tampa Red and Memphis Minnie, and soon after the sale to Warner Bros., the label signed rising radio and recording stars Bing Crosby, Mills Brothers, and Boswell Sisters. Unfortunately for Warner Bros., the dual impact of the Great Depression and the introduction of broadcast radio greatly harmed the recording industry—sales crashed, dropping by around 90% from more than 100 million records in 1927 to fewer than 10 million by 1932 and major companies were forced to halve the price of records from 75 to 35 cents.\nIn December 1931, Warner Bros. offloaded Brunswick to the American Record Corporation (ARC) for a fraction of its former value, in a lease arrangement which did not include Brunswick's pressing plants. Technically, Warner maintained actual ownership of Brunswick, which with the sale of ARC to CBS in 1939 and their decision to discontinue Brunswick in favor of reviving the Columbia label, reverted to Warner Bros. Warner Bros. sold Brunswick a second time (along with Brunswick's back catalog up to 1931) in 1941, this time along with the old Brunswick pressing plants Warner owned, to Decca Records (which formed its American operations in 1934) in exchange for a financial interest in Decca. The heavy loss it incurred in the Brunswick deal kept the studio out of the record business for almost 20 years, and during this period it licensed its film music to other companies for release as soundtrack albums.\n\n\n=== 1958–1963: formation and early years ===\n  \nWarner Bros. returned to the record business on March 19, 1958, with the establishment of its own recording division, Warner Bros. Records. By this time, the established Hollywood studios were reeling from multiple challenges to their former dominance—the most notable being the introduction of television in the late 1940s. Legal changes also had a major impact on their business—lawsuits brought by major stars had effectively overthrown the old studio contract system by the late 1940s and, beginning in 1949, anti-trust suits brought by the U.S. government forced the five major studios to divest their cinema chains.\nIn 1956, Harry Warner and Albert Warner sold their interest in the studio and the board was joined by new members who favored a renewed expansion into the music business—Charles Allen of the investment bank Charles Allen & Company, Serge Semenenko of the First National Bank of Boston and investor David Baird. Semenenko in particular had a strong professional interest in the entertainment \nOn May 14, 1988, the Atlantic Records label held its 40th-anniversary celebration by staging, at Madison Square Garden, New York, a non-stop concert lasting almost 13 hours starting at noon and ending just shortly before 1 am the following morning. The event was dubbed \"It's Only Rock And Roll\".\nOnly artists who had released material on the Atlantic label in the United States performed, spanning the company's forty-year existence. Lavern Baker and Ruth Brown were the longest tenured Atlantic acts to perform, while Debbie Gibson was the most recent.\nSome Atlantic signings, who had either officially split up or not performed together for a number of years, re-formed especially to perform. These included The Rascals, Iron Butterfly, and the former members of Led Zeppelin. Other notable performers included Yes, Genesis, Crosby, Stills & Nash, Keith Emerson and Carl Palmer (representing Emerson, Lake & Palmer), Foreigner, Paul Rodgers, Bob Geldof, Booker T. Jones, Wilson Pickett, The Coasters, The Spinners, Phil Collins, Peabo Bryson, The Blues Brothers (featuring Dan Aykroyd and Sam Moore), Roberta Flack, The Manhattan Transfer, Bee Gees, Ben E. King, and Vanilla Fudge.\nPlans to close the performance with a greatest hits all-star jam were shelved. Instead, the former members of Led Zeppelin were the last act. \"No rehearsal and just shambling on,\" recalled guitarist Jimmy Page.\nThe concert was broadcast live in the US on FM radio and HBO television; commentary for the latter being provided backstage by comedian Robert Townsend. HBO commenced its live broadcast a few hours into the event and interspersed footage of the concert that had been taped earlier by the network. In so doing, some of the artists' sets were edited or omitted. An edited version aired later that year on ABC hosted by Robert Hays. The audio was recorded by David Hewitt and Stanley Johnston on the Record Plant Black Truck.\nBanners heralding the reunion of Led Zeppelin were displayed like tapestry by excited fans – but, to the fans' dismay, were taken down before HBO went with their live feed.\nIn the United Kingdom, the event was broadcast over four weeks by BBC Two, presented as hour-long episodes. Atlantic issued this production on video as Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary: It's Only Rock 'n' Roll. The release intercut concert footage with highlights of earlier performances, and older footage from the Atlantic archives.\n\n\n== Performances ==\nMarv Albert\n\nIntroduction\nThe Coasters\n\n\"That Is Rock-N-Roll\"\n\"Charlie Brown\"\nPhil Collins\n\n\"In the Air Tonight\"\nPhil Collins\n\nIntroduction of LaVern Baker\nLavern Baker\n\n\"Jim Dandy\"\n\"Saved\"\nRoberta Flack\n\nIntroduction of Foreigner\nForeigner\n\n\"Hot Blooded\"\n\"Juke Box Hero\"\n\"Urgent\"\n\"I Want To Know What Love Is\"\nIron Butterfly\n\n\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\"\nLaura Branigan\n\n\"Gloria\"\nStephen Stills\n\nIntroduction of Ben E.

Founded in 1957 as Satellite Records, the label changed its name to Stax Records in September 1961. It also shared its operations with sister label Volt Records.\nStax was influential in the creation of Southern soul and Memphis soul music. Stax also released gospel, funk, and blues recordings. Renowned for its output of blues music, the label was founded by two siblings and business partners, Jim Stewart and Estelle Axton (STewart/AXton = Stax). It featured several popular ethnically integrated bands (including the label's house band, Booker T. & the M.G.'s) and a racially integrated team of staff and artists unprecedented in that time of racial strife and tension in Memphis and the South. According to ethnomusicologist Rob Bowman, the label's use of \"one studio, one equipment set-up, the same set of musicians and a small group of songwriters led to a readily identifiable sound. It was a sound based in black gospel, blues, country, and earlier forms of rhythm and blues (R&B). It became known as southern soul music.\"\nFollowing the death of Stax's biggest star, Otis Redding, in 1967, and the severance of the label's distribution deal with Atlantic Records in 1968, Stax continued primarily under the supervision of a new co-owner, Al Bell. Over the next five years, Bell expanded the label's operations significantly, in order to compete with Stax's main rival, Motown Records in Detroit. During the mid-1970s, a number of factors, including a problematic distribution deal with CBS Records, caused the label to slide into insolvency, resulting in its forced closure in late 1975.\nIn 1977, Fantasy Records acquired the post-1968 Stax catalogue and selected pre-1968 recordings. Beginning in 1978, Stax (now owned by Fantasy) began signing new acts and issuing new material, as well as reissuing previously recorded Stax material. However, by the early 1980s, no new material was being issued on the label, and for the next two decades, Stax was strictly a reissue label.\nAfter Concord Records acquired Fantasy in 2004, the Stax label was reactivated, and is today used to issue both the 1968–1975 catalog material and new recordings by current R&B and soul performers. Atlantic Records continues to hold the rights to the vast majority of the 1959–1968 Stax material.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1957–1960: early years as Satellite Records ===\n\nStax Records, originally named Satellite Records, was founded in Memphis in 1957 by Jim Stewart, initially operating in a garage. Satellite's early releases were country music, rockabilly records or straight pop numbers, reflecting the tastes of Stewart (a country fiddle player) at the time.\nIn 1958, Stewart's sister Estelle Axton began her financial interest in the company. Taking a considerable financial risk, she mortgaged her family home to invest US$2,500 (US$26,401 in 2023 dollars) in the company, enabling Satellite to purchase an Ampex 350 mono console tape recorder.\nThe company set up a small recording studio in a converted garage near National Cemetery in Brunswick, Tennessee, in 1959. In 1970, Stewart recalled this portion of the label's origins, and remarked, \"I don't even remember the address. We didn't have any sound equipment or anything else but a small building and a lot of desire.\"\nAround this time, Stewart was introduced to rhythm and blues music by staff producer Chips Moman. In the summer of that year, Satellite released its first record by a rhythm and blues act, \"Fool in Love\", by the Veltones, which was soon picked up for national distribution by Mercury Records. However, Satellite remained primarily a country and pop label for the next year or so.\nWhile promoting \"Fool in Love\", Stewart met with Memphis disc jockey and R&B singer Rufus Thomas, and both parties were impressed by the other. Around the same time, and at the urging of Chips Moman, Stewart moved the company back to Memphis and into an old movie theat\nBig Beat Records, Inc. is an American electronic and dance music record label, owned by Warner Music Group and operates through Atlantic Records. It was founded as an independent record label in 1986 by Craig Kallman with an emphasis on house music, and later hip hop. It was absorbed into Atlantic Records in 1998, and eventually relaunched separately in 2010 as a primarily electronic music label. Its current roster includes 100 gecs, Dog Blood, Galantis, Whethan, Cash Cash, and Clean Bandit.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1987–1998: Original Big Beat ===\nThe first iteration of Big Beat was founded as an Independent record label in 1986 by Craig Kallman who was, at the time, a 20-year-old deejay in New York City. The company initially operated out of Kallman's bedroom where he recorded the label's first track, \"Join Hands\" by Taravhonty, which sold 5,000 copies largely through direct promotion at record stores by Kallman himself.\nThe second record Kallman recorded in his bedroom studio was titled \"The Party\" by Kraze which would go on to sell 250,000 units in the United States and internationally. Soon after, Kallman began focusing on developing the record label, signing acts like Tara Kemp and Jomanda over the following three years. He would sell Kemp's contract to Giant in 1991. Also that year, Jomanda released a record entitled \"Got a Love for You\" on Big Beat which attracted the attention of Doug Morris, the co-chairman of Atlantic Records at the time. Atlantic acquired Big Beat and made Kallman the Vice President of A&R while he still operated Big Beat.\nAs the 1990s escalated, the label's roster shifted from primarily house music to more hip hop music. Big Beat signed a variety of artists including Mad Skillz, Changing Faces, Robin S., Fat Joe, Junior M.A.F.I.A., Lil' Kim (both via the company's Undeas imprint), Artifacts, Art n' Soul, Double X Posse, Kenny Dope, Dawn Penn, Marshall Jefferson, Todd Terry, Quad City DJs, Percee P, and numerous others.\nIn 1997, the label signed Fat Joe. The label found success with Fat Joe with his third studio album Don Cartagena, released in September 1998. The album was top 10 on the Billboard 200, and was certified Gold by the RIAA.\nIn 1998, the label and its roster were absorbed into Atlantic Records. In 2001, an attempt to relaunch Big Beat was planned, but ultimately abandoned.\n\n\n=== 2010–present: Relaunch ===\nBig Beat was relaunched under Atlantic Records as a dance-focused label in 2010. Artists on the label at the time of the relaunch included Skrillex, Chromeo, Wynter Gordon, Martin Solveig, Teddybears, and others. The relaunched label's first hit came in 2010 with Wynter Gordon's \"Dirty Talk\" which reached #1 on the ARIA singles chart and the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart and was certified triple platinum in Australia. Martin Solveig's song \"Hello,\" which was released in 2011 in the United States, peaked at #46 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and at #1 on the Dance Club Songs chart while also achieving Platinum status from the RIAA.\nSkrillex's Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites EP, released in 2010, effectively charted the label's trajectory toward electronic music. The EP sold hundreds of thousands of copies and its title track sold over 2 million copies and appeared on the Billboard Hot 100. At the 54th Grammy Awards in 2012, the EP was named the Best Dance/Electronic Album and its title track won Best Dance Recording. The following year at the 55th Grammy Awards, Skrillex again won Best Dance/Electronic Album for his Bangarang EP along with Best Dance Recording for the EP's title track which featured Sirah. He also won the Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical for his and Nero's remix of the Nero song, \"Promises\".\nIn 2013, Big Beat signed Icona Pop, a Swedish electropop duo that would go on to release the 4× Platinum \"I Love It\" featuring Charli XCX. The label also signed Cash Cash—whose 2013 single, \"Take Me Home\" featuring Bebe Rexha, was certified Platinum— and Galan\nElektra Records (or Elektra Entertainment) is an American record label owned by Warner Music Group, founded in 1950 by Jac Holzman and Paul Rickolt. It played an important role in the development of contemporary folk and rock music between the 1950s and 1970s. In 2004, it was consolidated into WMG's Atlantic Records Group. After five years of dormancy, the label was revived as an imprint of Atlantic in 2009. In October 2018, Elektra was detached from the Atlantic Records umbrella and reorganized into Elektra Music Group, once again operating as an independently managed frontline label of Warner Music. In June 2022, Elektra Music Group was merged with 300 Entertainment to create the umbrella label 300 Elektra Entertainment (3EE), though both Elektra and 300 continued to maintain their separate identities as labels.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1950–1971: Founding and early history ===\nElektra was formed in 1950, as the Elektra-Stratford Record Corporation, with a singles label called Stratford Records, by Jac Holzman and Paul Rickolt in Holzman's St. John's College dorm room. Each invested $300. The usual spelling of the Greek mythological Pleiad Electra was changed. Holzman famously explained, \"I gave her the 'K' that I lacked\". He found the 'C' in the original name \"too soft\", but liked the \"solid bite\" of the letter 'K', citing its use in the Kodak name.\nThe first Elektra LP, New Songs (EKLP 1 released March 1951), was a collection of Lieder and similar art songs, which sold few copies. During the 1950s and early 1960s, the label concentrated on folk music recordings, releasing a number of best-selling albums by Theodore Bikel, Ed McCurdy, Oscar Brand, and Judy Collins, and protest singers such as Phil Ochs and Tom Paxton. Holzman also recorded Josh White, who was without a record deal as a result of McCarthyite blacklisting.\n\nIn 1964, Elektra launched Nonesuch Records. This classical budget label was the best-selling budget classical label of the era. Other labels followed suit by starting their own budget series, but Nonesuch remained the most popular and Jac Holzman states in his book that profits from the budget classical label made it possible for Elektra to experiment with their pop releases by the mid-1960s.\nIn 1965, Elektra began a short-lived joint venture with Survey Music called Bounty Records, which was Elektra's first foray into pop music. The most notable signing for Bounty was the Paul Butterfield Band who was moved over to Elektra when Bounty folded.\nElektra's entrance into pop gained the label considerable prestige within the music scene by being one of the first labels to sign up leading acts from the new wave of American psychedelic rock of 1966–1967. The label's most important signings were the Chicago-based Paul Butterfield Blues Band (with Mike Bloomfield), the Los Angeles bands Love and The Doors, and the Detroit bands The Stooges and MC5. Included in Elektra's Los Angeles-based signings were Tim Buckley and Bread. In 1968, the label also signed pioneering rock guitar soloist Lonnie Mack to a three-album deal.\nAlso in 1967, Elektra launched its Nonesuch Explorer Series, one of the first collections of what is now referred to as world music. Excerpts from several Nonesuch Explorer recordings were later included on the two Voyager Golden Discs, which were sent into deep space in 1977 aboard the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 space probes.\n\n\n=== 1971–1989: Elektra/Asylum Records ===\nElektra, along with its Nonesuch Records subsidiary, was acquired by Kinney National Services in 1970, which changed its name to Warner Communications in 1972. Soon afterwards, Kinney consolidated their label holdings under the Warner-Elektra-Atlantic umbrella. Holzman remained in charge of Elektra until 1972, when it merged with Asylum Records to become Elektra/Asylum Records; Asylum's founder, David Geffen, headed the newly combined label. Holzman, in the meantime, was appointed senior vice president and chief technologist for Warner — us\nAtlantic Records Russia (known until 24 March 2021 as Zhara Music) was a Russian music label, one of the branches of Atlantic Records. The company took part in music distribution, bookings, promotion of artists, music content and organizational activities. The label's artists included Morgenshtern, HammAli & Navai, Emin, Bahh Tee, Rauf & Faik, Jony, ЛСП, Dava, Johnyboy, RaiM & other musicians.\n\n\n== History ==\nZhara Music (2018–2020)\nOn 15 June 2018, Emin Agalarov, vice-president of the holding Crocus Group, better known as Emin, released the song «Невероятная». This release started the music label Zhara Music. The partner for helping the project was Russian singer Bakhtar Aliyev, also known by his stage name Bahh Tee, also the owner of music label Siyah Music.\n\nAtlantic Records Russia (2021–2022)\nOn March 24, 2021, it became known about the purchase of the Warner Music Group label, on its basis the Russian division of the American label Atlantic Records, which is part of the Warner Music group of companies, was created. Bakhtiyar Aliyev headed the newly created label. Later, the approximate cost of acquiring the record company became known - $25,000,000. Later, the collection Atlantic Records Russia: F1rst Blood was released to coincide with the creation of a new label.\nOn February 24, 2022, a message appeared in the official Atlantic Records Russia VKontakte group about the cancellation of all upcoming releases and the postponement of their premieres for an indefinite period. On March 10, 2022, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Atlantic's parent organization and distributor, Warner Music Group, announced the suspension of operations in Russia, including investment and project development, advertising and marketing activities, and the production of all physical products.\nOn 1 March 2023, Bahh Tee stepped down from his position as CEO of Atlantic Records Russia. He created a new label, Lotus Music.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\nLists of Atlantic Records artists include artists who record or have recorded for Atlantic Records.\n\nAtlantic Records discography\nList of Atlantic Records artists\n\n\n== See also ==\nAtlantic Records\nAaron Bay-Schuck (born September 5, 1981) is an American music industry executive. The CEO and co-chairman of Warner Records (formerly Warner Bros. Records), he was previously the president of A&R at Interscope Geffen A&M and the senior vice president of A&R at Atlantic Records.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBay-Schuck was born in Los Angeles to actors Susan Bay and John Schuck. His parents divorced when he was a child, and in 1989 his mother married actor Leonard Nimoy. His mother is a cousin of film director and producer Michael Bay.\nBay-Schuck attended Columbia University, where he majored in political science. He planned to attend law school and pursue a career in entertainment law. In his senior year, he met a video promotion executive from Capitol Records and had a conversation with her about how record companies operate. The next day he applied for an internship at Interscope Records. He was hired, and although he interned in the video promotion department, he became interested in A&R. He graduated from Columbia in 2003.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Atlantic Records, Interscope ===\nBay-Schuck returned to Los Angeles following his college graduation. Knowing that jobs at record companies had become scarce as the music industry constricted in the post-Napster era, he registered at an employment agency that placed temps at labels. He was assigned a short-term job at Interscope, and was quickly hired as a full-time assistant to Martin Kierszenbaum, then the head of international marketing for the label.  Determined to work in A&R, he left Interscope a year later to take a job as an A&R assistant at Atlantic.  In 2006, he was promoted to a staff A&R position.  His first hits in an A&R capacity were with the songs \"Shawty\" by Plies featuring T-Pain, and \"Right Round\" by Flo Rida featuring Kesha. Bay-Schuck co-wrote \"Right Round,\" which went five times platinum in the US and sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.\nOver the course of his ten years at Atlantic, Bay-Schuck worked with Cee Lo Green, B.o.B., T.I., Trey Songz, Travie McCoy, and Trick Daddy, among others. Most notably, he discovered, signed and developed Bruno Mars, who has since sold more than 170 million singles and 26 million albums worldwide. Following his success with Mars, Bay-Schuck, who had originally focused on rap and R&B, worked with artists of all genres. He was appointed senior vice president of A&R for Atlantic in 2012.\nIn 2014, Bay-Schuck was named president of A&R at Interscope Geffen A&M (IGA). At IGA he worked with artists including Gwen Stefani, Imagine Dragons, Lady Gaga, Skylar Grey, Maroon 5, OneRepublic, and Selena Gomez.\n\n\n=== Warner Records ===\nIn October 2017, it was announced that Bay-Schuck had been appointed CEO and co-chairman of Warner Records. He assumed the position in October 2018. He said that increasing the focus on pop and hip hop artists were among his goals as Warner's CEO; since then, the label has had #1 hits with Saweetie featuring Doja Cat (\"Best Friend\"), Dua Lipa (\"Levitating\") and Bebe Rexha (\"Meant to Be\"); and signed artists including Zach Bryan, Teddy Swims, NLE Choppa, Benson Boone, Veeze, and Omar Apollo.\nBay-Schuck was an executive producer of the 2021 documentary Tom Petty, Somewhere You Feel Free: The Making of Wildflowers. The film won a Producers Guild Award in 2022.   He was included in the Billboard Power 100  in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023. He appeared on the Billboard Country Power Players list in 2024. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWarner Records\nATCO Records is an American record label founded in 1955. It is owned by Warner Music Group and operates as an imprint of Atlantic Records. After several decades of dormancy and infrequent activity under alternating Warner Music labels, the company was relaunched by Atlantic Records in early 2020.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1950s–1960s: Beginnings ===\nATCO Records was devised as an outlet for productions by one of Atlantic Records' founders, Herb Abramson, who had returned to the company from military service. The label was also intended as a home for acts that did not fit the format of the main Atlantic brand, which was releasing blues, jazz, rhythm and blues and soul. The planned name for the label was Atlas.  But it was changed to ATCO when it was discovered there was already an Atlas Records. The ATCO name is an abbreviation of ATlantic COrporation. ATCO also provided distribution for other labels, including RSO, Volt, Island, Modern, Ruthless, Hansa, and Rolling Stones. For most of its history, ATCO was known for pop and rock music, but during its early years, it produced some jazz albums. These included Harry Arnold, Betty Carter, King Curtis, Herb Geller, Roland Hanna, and Helen Merrill.\nATCO's rock era began with Bobby Darin and The Coasters. In the early 1960s, Atlantic began to license material from international sources, leading to instrumental hit singles from Jorgen Ingmann, Acker Bilk and Bent Fabric. Starting in the mid-1960s, ATCO moved into rock-and-roll with Sonny and Cher, Buffalo Springfield, Vanilla Fudge, Iron Butterfly and Cream (the latter under license from British label Polydor).\nIn 1964, ATCO released a single in the US by the Beatles, \"Ain't She Sweet\" (flip side \"Nobody's Child\", with lead singer Tony Sheridan), which had been recorded in Hamburg in 1961. With lead vocals by John Lennon, \"Ain't She Sweet\" reached No. 19 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in August 1964. ATCO also released an album entitled Ain't She Sweet which featured the other two tracks by Sheridan and The Beatles from the Hamburg session and filled out by eight other songs covered by The Swallows.\nIn 1966, ATCO released \"Substitute\" by the Who. The song was issued through an arrangement with UK Polydor Records because of the dispute The Who was having with their producer, Shel Talmy, and their contract with US Decca Records and UK Brunswick Records. This would be the only Who recording to appear on ATCO, although Pete Townshend and John Entwistle would eventually sign to ATCO as solo artists, and Roger Daltrey later signed a US solo deal with Atlantic. This release differs from the UK release with a different structure/edit (the break comes in after the first verse vs. second), a substitute lyric (\"I try walking forward but my feet walk back\" in place of \"I look all white but my dad was black\").\n\n\n=== 1970s–1980s: Downsizing ===\nDuring the 1970s, Atlantic Records began to broaden the range of its own roster, causing ATCO to become deemphasized as many of its acts would eventually have their material released under the main Atlantic brand. In the middle 1970s, ATCO became increasingly used for hard rock acts and some British and European bands. During this time, the label issued early albums from AC/DC. Starting in 1978, however, AC/DC releases were issued on Atlantic until their contract with the label ended in the 1990s. In 1980, ATCO's visibility rose with strong chart performances from Pete Townshend's Empty Glass album and the song \"Cars\" by Gary Numan. As the 1980s wore on, ATCO continued to have streamlined success with artists such as Sweet Sensation, JJ Fad and Michel'le (the latter who were signed to the label in conjunction with Ruthless Records), while steadily becoming less active overall.\n\n\n=== 1990s: Merger with EastWest Records America and dormancy ===\nThe last number one hit on ATCO was \"If Wishes Came True\" by Sweet Sensation in 1990. The following year, Atlantic Records Senior VP Sylvia Rhone orchestrated the merger o\nAmerican singer-songwriter Bruno Mars has recorded songs for three studio albums, one collaborative album, one extended play (EP) and three soundtrack albums. He has also featured as a guest artist and provided background vocals to other songs. After an unsuccessful contract with Motown Records and a fruitless conversation with will.i.am's management, Mars signed with Atlantic Records in 2009. He came to prominence as a composer for other artists with Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine, who called themselves the Smeezingtons. They composed B.o.B's \"Nothin' on You\" (2009), and Travie McCoy's \"Billionaire\" (2010); Mars sang on their choruses.\nThe Smeezingtons composed Mars's debut EP, It's Better If You Don't Understand, released in May 2010, and his debut studio album Doo-Wops & Hooligans, released in October 2010. The album included the songs \"Just the Way You Are\", \"Grenade\" and \"Runaway Baby\". It featured collaborations with Damian Marley, B.o.B and CeeLo Green, and the songs included on the EP, \"Somewhere in Brooklyn\", \"The Other Side\", \"Count On Me\" and \"Talking to the Moon\". Mars's love for doo-wop music inspired the album which is primarily a pop, reggae pop and R&B record. In 2011, he appeared as a featured artist on Bad Meets Evil's \"Lighters\" and Lil Wayne's \"Mirror\". He has contributed songs to soundtracks: \"It Will Rain\" for The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1, \"Young, Wild & Free\" by Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa for Mac & Devin Go to High School and \"Welcome Back\" for Rio 2.\nMars's second studio album Unorthodox Jukebox, released in December 2012, included the tracks \"Locked Out of Heaven\", \"When I Was Your Man\", \"Treasure\" and \"Moonshine\". The Smeezingtons collaborated with other producers, including Mark Ronson, Jeff Bhasker and Emile Haynie, to create a disco, funk, pop, reggae, and rock album. Lyrically, it showcases traditional notions of romance, male chauvinism, and sexuality. In 2014, Ronson's single, \"Uptown Funk\", featured Mars. Shampoo Press & Curl, a production trio formed by Mars, Lawrence and Christopher Brody Brown, composed the tracks on his third studio album, 24K Magic, released in November 2016. It included the songs \"24K Magic\", \"That's What I Like\", and a remix of \"Finesse\" featuring Cardi B. Funk, pop and R&B influenced the creation of this album, which involves subjects of money and sex.\nMars and Anderson .Paak, as Silk Sonic, released the collaborative studio album An Evening with Silk Sonic, in November 2021. It was produced by Mars, D'Mile and The Stereotypes. It includes the singles \"Leave the Door Open\" and \"Smokin out the Window\". The album is rooted in R&B, soul, funk, early hip-hop and pop. It explores themes of \"seduction, romance\", reconciliation and materialism. In 2024, Mars collaborated with Lady Gaga on the single \"Die With a Smile\" and with Rosé on Apt.. \n\n\n== Songs ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBruno Mars on AllMusic\nAsylum Records is an American record label, founded in 1971 by David Geffen and partner Elliot Roberts. It was taken over by Warner Communications (now the Warner Music Group) in 1972, and later merged with Elektra Records to become Elektra/Asylum Records.\nAfter previous incarnations, it is geared primarily towards hip-hop, along with rock and alternative metal. It is owned and distributed by Warner Music Group.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation ===\n\nAsylum was founded in 1971 by David Geffen, and partner Elliot Roberts, both of whom had previously worked as agents at the William Morris Agency, and operated a folk/rock label. They had also previously founded their own management company. While unsuccessfully pitching a recording contract for their client Jackson Browne to Atlantic Records president Ahmet Ertegun, Geffen said, \"You'll make a lot of money.\" Ertegun replied, \"You know what, David, I have a lot of money. Why don't you start a record company and then you'll have a lot of money.\" A deal was then struck in which Ertegun would put up the initial funds, Atlantic Records would distribute Asylum Records, and the profits would be split 50/50.\nAlthough they knew they would sign Browne, the first act that Geffen asked to join the label was his close friend Laura Nyro, whose career he was managing at the time. Nyro initially agreed, but without Geffen's knowledge she changed her mind and re-signed with Columbia Records. Geffen said it was the biggest betrayal of his life up to that point and that he \"cried for days\".\nAsylum's early releases were distributed by Atlantic Records. The same year, Asylum signed Jo Jo Gunne, Linda Ronstadt, John David Souther, Judee Sill, David Blue, Joni Mitchell and Glenn Frey (whom Geffen encouraged to form the Eagles, with Don Henley, Bernie Leadon, and Randy Meisner). In 1972, then folk-based singer/songwriter Tom Waits signed with the label, releasing his debut, Closing Time, in 1973. His seventh and final album for the label, Heartattack and Vine, was released in 1980. Former Creedence Clearwater Revival frontman John Fogerty signed with the label in 1974. The biggest coup for Asylum was signing Bob Dylan, who had been with Columbia Records since the early 1960s but who, after a falling-out with the company, was shopping around for a new label. Dylan recorded two albums, Planet Waves and the live Before the Flood, for Asylum before returning to Columbia. Columbia reissued Dylan's two Asylum albums in 1981.\n\n\n=== Merger with Elektra Records ===\n \n\nAsylum was taken over by Warner Communications in 1973 and merged with Elektra Records to become Elektra/Asylum Records. David Geffen and Elliot Roberts each received $2 million in cash and $5 million in Warner Communications stock, thereby becoming two of the company's largest shareholders. Geffen served as president and chairman of Elektra/Asylum Records until 1975, when he crossed over to film and was named vice-chairman of Warner Bros. One of Asylum's most prominent signings after Geffen's departure was Warren Zevon, who released a series of successful and critically acclaimed LPs for the label; his self-titled 1976 label debut has been called the best California rock album of the decade.\nBy the early 1980s, although the copyright lines on albums still read \"Elektra/Asylum Records\" or \"Elektra/Asylum/Nonesuch Records\", Elektra was becoming the more prominent of the two labels with Asylum turning into a secondary imprint. By the middle of the decade, the company was unofficially calling itself Elektra Records, and in 1989 it was renamed Elektra Entertainment. By this time Asylum's remaining acts had been shifted to the Elektra roster, although catalog recordings and reissues continued to be sold with the Asylum label on them.\n\n\n=== Country format ===\nAsylum was reformatted into a country music label, still operated by Elektra, in 1992. Under the new format, Asylum scored successful recordings by such acts as Emmylou Harris, Brother Phelps, Thrashe\nJohn Ford Coley (born October 13, 1948) is an American singer, classically trained pianist, guitarist, actor, and author most known for his partnership in the musical duo England Dan & John Ford Coley.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nColey was born John Edward Colley in Dallas, Texas, United States. He grew up listening to the Grand Ole Opry, early rock and roll, singing church hymns and was trained as a classical pianist. At 16, while at W. W. Samuell High School in Dallas, Coley, along with schoolmate Dan Seals, joined the group Theze Few, which later became Southwest F.O.B. and toured the Texas music scene where they had one hit, \"The Smell of Incense\", which in 1969 rose to number 43 on the charts. This band played on the bill with Led Zeppelin and other acts.\nWhile in the band, Seals and Coley began their own acoustic act, Coley and Wayland. The act was renamed England Dan & John Ford Coley, and the duo was signed by A&M Records. In 1971, the two moved to Los Angeles where they opened for numerous bands. Their first break came in 1972 with the song \"Simone\". It became a number one hit in Japan and was popular in France. However, \"Simone\" did not fare as well in the United States, and the two were released from their contract with A&M after three albums.\n\n\n== Signing to Atlantic Records ==\nTwo years later, they acquired another record deal from Atlantic Records subsidiary Big Tree Records and released the song \"I'd Really Love to See You Tonight\". Overall they had four top-ten hits and two top-twenty hits. They were nominated for a Grammy Award, received triple-platinum and gold records and released eight albums; additionally, other recordings were released abroad.\nThe duo disbanded in 1980.\n\n\n== After the 1980s ==\nColey formed another group that released an album on A&M Records: Leslie, Kelly and John Ford Coley (featuring sisters Leslie and Kelly Bulkin). He acted in teen films in the 1980s, acquired a small ranch in the 1990s, and wrote songs for film and television. He returned to touring in 1996. Coley plays with groups and artists including Ambrosia and Terry Sylvester (formerly of The Hollies), Three Dog Night, Lou Gramm (of Foreigner), Christopher Cross, Poco, Stephen Bishop, Al Stewart, Edgar Winter and others.\nIn 1996, Coley made a trip south for Tin Pan South and began making trips to Nashville to be part of the music community. He moved his family and horses across country to Tennessee in 1999. While in Tennessee, Coley, once a Baháʼí, converted back to Christianity. Coley continues to perform internationally.\nOn August 11, 1997, a handyman in Long Island, New York was arrested for impersonating Coley.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nSmell of Incense - Southwest F.O.B., 1969\nEngland Dan and John Ford Coley - England Dan and John Ford Coley, 1971\nFables - England Dan and John Ford Coley, 1972\nI Hear Music - England Dan and John Ford Coley, 1976\nNights Are Forever - England Dan and John Ford Coley, 1976\nDowdy Ferry Road - England Dan and John Ford Coley, 1977\nSome Things Don't Come Easy - England Dan and John Ford Coley, 1978\nDr. Heckle and Mr. Jive - England Dan and John Ford Coley, 1979\nJust Tell Me You Love Me - England Dan and John Ford Coley, 1980\nLeslie, Kelly and John Ford Coley - Leslie, Kelly and John Ford Coley, 1980 (A&M Records)\nThe Best of England Dan and John Ford Coley - England Dan and John Ford Coley, 1980\nLive from the Philippines - John Ford Coley, 2009\nEclectic - John Ford Coley, 2016\nLong Way Home (Live in Israel & L.A.) - John Ford Coley, 2020\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nThe following is a list of songs known to have been recorded by Australian rock band AC/DC. Since 1973, they have released 18 studio albums (16 available worldwide and two issued only in Australasia), two soundtrack albums, three live albums, one extended play, 57 singles, 11 video albums, 52 music videos and two box sets. Although many AC/DC singles have been released, the band refused to issue any greatest hits-type packages. Brothers Angus (lead guitar) and Malcolm Young (rhythm guitar) formed AC/DC in November 1973 in Sydney. The band released two albums in Australasia before issuing their first international effort, High Voltage in 1976; the Youngs had been joined by vocalist Bon Scott, bassist Mark Evans and drummer Phil Rudd. In 1980, less than a year after the appearance of the successful Highway to Hell, Scott died and was replaced by British singer Brian Johnson, with whom AC/DC released their best-selling album, Back in Black. The album Black Ice, from 2008, reached number one in 29 countries. In 50 years of their career, AC/DC have sold over 200 million albums worldwide, roughly 100 million in the United States. Back in Black alone sold 25 million copies in the US (50 million worldwide), and went on to become the second highest-selling album in history.\nVerizon made AC/DC albums available for digital download in 2007; for five years the band refused to release their albums via iTunes, as that company allows downloading of individual tracks. Angus Young observed, \"We honestly believe the songs on any of our albums belong together. If we were on iTunes, we know a certain percentage of people would only download two or three songs from the album – and we don't think that represents us musically.\" However, in November 2012, the band relented and released their entire discography via iTunes. On 30 June 2015 their catalogue appeared on Spotify for the first time, which made their works available for streaming. Their most certified singles in the US are \"You Shook Me All Night Long\" and \"Back in Black\" (both 1980) – each have received 3× platinum from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2019. In Australia, \"Thunderstruck\" (1990) was accredited 10× platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) in 2022.\n\n\n== List ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nInterscope Records is an American record label based in Santa Monica, California, owned by Universal Music Group through its Interscope Geffen A&M imprint. Founded in late 1990 by Jimmy Iovine and Ted Field as a $20 million joint venture with Atlantic Records of Warner Music Group and Interscope Communications, it differed from most record labels by letting A&R staff control decisions and allowing artists and producers full creative control. Interscope's first hit records arrived in under a year, and it achieved profitability in 1993. Chair and CEO until May 2014, Iovine was succeeded by John Janick.\nIn 1992, Interscope acquired the exclusive rights to market and distribute releases from hardcore hip hop label Death Row Records, a decision that ultimately put the label at the center of the mid-1990s gangsta rap controversy. As a result, Time Warner, then the parent of Warner Music Group, severed ties with Interscope by selling its 50 percent stake back to Field and Iovine for $115 million in 1995. In 1996, 50% of the label was acquired for a reported $200 million by MCA Inc., later known as Universal Music Group.\nInterscope's artist roster includes Sting, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Lady Gaga, OneRepublic, Dermot Kennedy, Blackpink, Dr. Dre, DaBaby, Billie Eilish, Imagine Dragons, Olivia Rodrigo, Selena Gomez, Camila Cabello, Playboi Carti, Kendrick Lamar, Jennifer Hudson, Ken Carson, Destroy Lonely, Jay Rock, ScHoolboy Q, Lana Del Rey, Maroon 5, Moneybagg Yo, Gwen Stefani, Rae Sremmurd, Finneas, Gracie Abrams,  Zedd, Machine Gun Kelly, U2, Yeat, Yungblud, Cuco, d4vd, Homixide Gang, Reneé Rapp, J. Cole and Karol G.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1990–1995: Origins, early success, and joint ventures ===\nIn mid 1990, Ted Field began to build Interscope Records as a division of his film company, Interscope Communications. To run it, he hired John McClain, who had played a central role in Janet Jackson's success at A&M Records, and Tom Whalley, who had been the head of A&R at Capitol Records. Separately, Iovine, who had produced records for U2, Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Nicks, and John Lennon, among others, was trying to raise money to start a label. \"I thought, 'Music is going to change,'\" Iovine said in 1997. \"'Young bands aren't going to be asking for me.' But I love working with the new thing. I always liked the part of the business that's the first time you hear something, and I knew I wasn't in that business anymore.\"\nIovine and Field were introduced by Paul McGuinness, then U2's manager.  After a series of negotiations led by David Geffen, they came to an agreement, and in 1990, Interscope Records was founded as a joint venture with Atlantic Records. In a 1997 article in Rolling Stone, David Wild wrote: \"Interscope's start-up coincided with a period of incredible change in the music world. Nirvana had ushered in the alternative revolution... While the major labels were packed with rosters full of expensive veteran artists who had to redefine themselves for a new rock era, Interscope was in the business of signing new artists and could – as Iovine puts it – 'move on a dime.'\"\nBased in Los Angeles, California in the Westwood neighborhood at an office building on 10900 Wilshire Boulevard, Interscope was run by \"music men\". It was a departure from the music industry practices of the 1970s and 1980s, when labels traditionally appointed lawyers and promotion executives to senior positions.  A founding tenet of the label was that artists would have complete creative control.\nInterscope's first release was \"Rico Suave\" by Ecuadorian rapper Gerardo in December 1990; the single reached number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 charts in April 1991. Primus' Interscope debut, Sailing the Seas of Cheese, was released in May, followed by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch's Music for the People in July.  It included the number-one single \"Good Vibrations\". Two days after first hearing his demo, Whalley signed Tupac Shakur in August 1991, and by November, Intersc\nRolling Stones Records was the record label formed by the Rolling Stones members Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Mick Taylor, Charlie Watts, and Bill Wyman in 1970, after their recording contract with Decca Records expired. The label was initially headed by Marshall Chess, the son of Chess Records founder Leonard Chess. It was first distributed in the United States by Atlantic Records subsidiary Atco Records. On 1 April 1971, the band signed a distribution deal for five albums with Ahmet Ertegun, acting on behalf of Atlantic Records. In the US, the albums were distributed by Atlantic until 1984. In the UK, Rolling Stones Records were distributed by WEA from 1971 to 1977 and by EMI from 1978 to 1984. In 1986, Columbia Records started distributing it in the United States and CBS for the rest of the world until 1991. It was discontinued in 1992 when the band signed to Virgin Records, but the tongue and lips logo remains on all post-1970 Rolling Stones releases.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn its original concept, the label was formed to ensure the Rolling Stones would retain the rights over their own music, while also giving each bandmember the option to release solo albums. The first album to be released was Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Joujouka in 1971, which is widely credited with being the first world music LP. In 1972 the label released Jamming with Edward!, a collection of tracks recorded by Jagger, Wyman, and Watts with Nicky Hopkins and Ry Cooder in 1969.\nBill Wyman released two solo albums through the label, Monkey Grip in 1974 and Stone Alone in 1976. Wyman found that the label's promotional and sales people paid very little attention to him, as the Rolling Stones had albums due out shortly after both releases which were the subject of major marketing campaigns. As a result, Wyman chose to record his next solo album with A&M.\nThe label also released a solo single by Richards in December 1978, featuring a rendition of Chuck Berry's \"Run Rudolph Run\" backed by a version of Jimmy Cliff's \"The Harder They Come\".\n\n\n== Other artists ==\nUnlike Apple Records, Grunt Records, Purple Records, or Swan Song Records (the vanity labels of the Beatles, Jefferson Airplane, Deep Purple, and Led Zeppelin respectively), Rolling Stones Records never made much of an effort to sign outside artists. Kracker, a Cuban American rock group produced by Rolling Stones producer, Jimmy Miller, was the first outside act to be signed to Rolling Stones Records in 1973. Kracker, along with Billy Preston, opened the show for the Stones during their 1973 European Tour. John Phillips was signed to Rolling Stones Records in 1976.\n\n\n=== Peter Tosh ===\nIn 1977 Peter Tosh, a former member of Bob Marley's band the Wailers signed a recording deal with Rolling Stones Records. His debut album on the label, Bush Doctor, which featured Jagger on the track \"Don't Look Back\", was moderately successful. Despite further moderate success, Tosh left the label in 1981 due to personal problems with Keith Richards and Mick Jagger, his band members and the recent passing of Bob Marley.\n\n\n== 1980s to the end ==\nJagger released his first solo albums, She's the Boss and Primitive Cool, in 1985 and 1987 respectively, through a newly conceived partnership between Rolling Stones Records and CBS Records (now Sony Music). Thus the trademark Rolling Stones logo was affixed to each record and the label \"Rolling Stones Records\" was also printed on each new release, which angered Richards. In fact, through the 1980s and early 1990s, \"Rolling Stones Records\" continued to be printed on the labels of all new releases up through Flashpoint (1991). However, as the back catalogue has been shifted to Virgin/EMI, these markers are the last vapour trails of Rolling Stones Records. In 2008, the group switched distribution of Rolling Stones Records back catalogue material as well as new material to Polydor Records in the UK, and Interscope Records in the US (both imprints of Universal Music Group, also\nAtlantic Crossing is the sixth solo album by Rod Stewart. Released on 15 August 1975, and recorded in five American studios including Muscle Shoals, Alabama, between April and June 1975, it was produced by Tom Dowd, and peaked at number one in the UK (his fourth solo album to do so), and number nine on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart. During 1975 Stewart moved to  Los Angeles, switched record labels to Warner Brothers, and ended his association with Ronnie Wood, Ian McLagan and the stable of musicians who had been his core collaborators on his albums for Mercury Records.\nThe album was divided into a fast side and a slow side, apparently at the suggestion of Stewart's then-girlfriend, Swedish actress Britt Ekland. Stewart would repeat the format for his next two albums. The album contained two of Stewart's most popular songs, \"Sailing\" and \"I Don't Want to Talk About It”, and classic rock favourites \"Three Time Loser\" and \"Stone Cold Sober\". The album was the 14th of Stewart's career, starting with Jeff Beck's Truth in 1968, and his sixth solo.  \n\n\n== Recording ==\n\nThe album was recorded in five different American studios: A&R (New York), Criteria (Miami), Wally Heider's Studio 3 (Hollywood), Hi Recording Studio (Memphis), and Muscle Shoals (Alabama) between April and June 1975, and produced by Tom Dowd, who had been the engineer or producer for many of Stewart's heroes during Dowd's time at Atlantic Records. \nWith Atlantic Crossing, Stewart ended his association with Ronnie Wood, Ian McLagan and the stable of musicians who had been his core collaborators on his classic run of albums for Mercury Records, fusing soul and folk. Instead, he used a group of session musicians, including The Memphis Horns and Booker T. and the MG's. The only song performed from this album on The Faces' final US tour in autumn 1975 was \"Three Time Loser\", and the rest of the group heavily disliked Stewart's change in musical direction on this album. Following the success of the album, and his move to the U.S., Stewart announced his exit from the Faces by the end of the year.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\"Sailing\" was a number one hit in the UK in September 1975, and returned to the UK Top 3 a year later when it was used as the theme for the BBC series Sailor; both acoustic and electric guitars in the song were played by Pete Carr. In 1977, almost two years after the album was released, Stewart scored another UK number one from the album with the double A-side single \"I Don't Want to Talk About It\" and \"The First Cut Is the Deepest\" (from the album A Night on the Town - 1976).\nIn 2009, Rhino Records released a two-disc version of the album with bonus tracks.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nFast Side (Side One)\n\n\"Three Time Loser\" (Rod Stewart) – 4:03\n\"Alright for an Hour\" (Stewart, Jesse Ed Davis) – 4:17\n\"All in the Name of Rock 'N' Roll\" (Stewart) – 5:02\n\"Drift Away\" (Mentor Williams) – 3:43\n\"Stone Cold Sober\" (Stewart, Steve Cropper) – 4:12\nSlow Side (Side Two)\n\n\"I Don't Want to Talk About It\" (Danny Whitten) – 4:47\n\"It's Not the Spotlight\" (Barry Goldberg, Gerry Goffin) – 4:21\n\"This Old Heart of Mine\" (Lamont Dozier, Brian Holland, Eddie Holland, Sylvia Moy) – 4:04\n\"Still Love You\" (Stewart) – 5:08\n\"Sailing\" (Gavin Sutherland) – 4:37\n\n\n=== 2009 two disc re-release ===\nDisc one\n\nTrack 1 – 10 features the original album.\n\"Skye Boat Song (The Atlantic Crossing Drum & Pipe Band)\" (Harold Boulton, Annie MacLeod) 4:13\nDisc two\n\n\"To Love Somebody\" (with Booker T. & The MG's) (Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb) – 4:12\n\"Holy Cow\" (with Booker T. & The MG's) (Allen Toussaint) – 3:16\n\"Return to Sender\" (with Booker T. & The MG's) (Otis Blackwell, Scott Winfield) – 3:42\n\"Three Time Loser\" [Alternate Version] (Stewart) – 4:40\n\"Alright for an Hour\" [Alternate Version] (Stewart, Davis) – 4:36\n\"All in the Name of Rock 'n' Roll\" [Alternate Version] (Stewart) – 5:00\n\"Drift Away\" [Alternate Version] (Williams) – 3:58\n\"Too Much Noise\" [Early Version of \"Stone Cold Sober\"] (Stewart,\nThe Staves are an English indie folk duo of sisters Jessica and Camilla Staveley-Taylor from Watford, Hertfordshire, England. Formerly their third sister Emily was also part of the band. \n\n\n== Career ==\nThe Staves began performing together at open-mic nights in Watford hosted by a local pub, The Horns. Originally performing as The Staveley-Taylors, the trio later changed their name to The Staves.\nThe group appeared on the Tom Jones album Praise and Blame, released in July 2010. They supported Mt. Desolation on their UK tour in late 2010. Jessica Staveley-Taylor also performed as part of Mt. Desolation and provided vocals for their eponymous album. The Staves released the Live at Cecil Sharp House EP and the Mexico EP in 2011, and appeared on Fionn Regan's third studio album, 100 Acres of Sycamore.\nThe Staves toured in the United States while supporting The Civil Wars in January 2012. They followed these appearances with performances at South by Southwest and a tour in March and April with Bear's Den, Nathaniel Rateliff and Ben Howard. This tour was the subject of the film, Austin to Boston, a documentary by Marcus Haney. The band supported Bon Iver on their May and June 2012 US and Canadian tour.\nThe band's debut album, Dead & Born & Grown, was released in November 2012 and produced by Glyn Johns and Ethan Johns.\nAn excerpt from their performance of \"Facing West\" on Later... with Jools Holland was featured on the This is BBC Two promotional programme.\nThe second album, If I Was, was released 23 March 2015 on Atlantic Records in the UK/EU and on 31 March on Nonesuch Records in the US; the record was produced by Justin Vernon of Bon Iver. The album debuted at number 14 on the UK Albums Chart. In July 2015, the Staves performed with Bon Iver as guest artists along with Colin Stetson, yMusic, and No BS! Brass for Bon Iver's return to the stage as part of the Eaux Claires Festival in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. They have also performed as the warm-up act for Florence and the Machine on Florence's How Big Tour supporting How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful.\nThe Staves joined the live line-up of Bon Iver for the latter's Asia tour in late February and early March 2016.\nOn 24 November 2017, The Staves released The Way is Read − an album created in conjunction with the New York-based chamber music ensemble yMusic. This album is available on vinyl, via the streaming service TIDAL in both normal and high quality MQA (Master Quality Authenticated) formats, and as an MP3 download. There is no CD version available.\nIn October and November 2018, they supported First Aid Kit on their Rebel Heart tour.\nIn January 2020, the Staves announced that Emily Staveley-Taylor would not take part in touring, following the birth of her daughter.\nIn March 2020, the Staves announced they would be performing at the Glastonbury Festival in 2020. But due to concerns over the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic, the festival had to be cancelled.\nOn 5 February 2021, their third studio album Good Woman was released via Atlantic Records UK and Nonesuch Records. The album was produced by John Congleton and charted at number 13 in the UK Albums Chart.\nIn November 2023, the Staves announced their fifth LP, All Now, and released the title track, having previously shared another song from the record, \"You Held It All\". The album will be their first as a two-piece, after the departure of Emily Staveley-Taylor.\n\n\n== Personal lives ==\nThe sisters learned to play guitar from their father while growing up in Watford. As children, they aspired to create a sketch comedy television programme together. They enjoy Guinness and are vocal in challenging tropes about sensitive wilderness-bound artists that dominate modern folk music culture.\nIn addition to touring with Bon Iver and producing If I Was with Justin Vernon, the sisters have become friends with the Wisconsin-born musician.\nIn mid 2018, the sisters' mother, Jean, a former teacher who had encouraged them to follow their dream of making \nLed Zeppelin were an English rock band who recorded 94 songs between 1968 and 1980. The band pioneered the concept of album-oriented rock and often refused to release popular songs as singles, instead viewing their albums as indivisible, complete listening experiences, and disliked record labels re-editing their songs for single releases.\nTheir self-titled debut album, Led Zeppelin, released in early 1969, contained songs that were influenced by the genres of blues, hard rock and heavy metal. Led Zeppelin II, released in October 1969, built upon their debut with a more direct, hard-hitting sound that has become a blueprint for heavy metal bands. Led Zeppelin III (1970) marked a musical growth for the band; half of its songs were hard rockers while the other half were built upon folk and acoustic music that gave it \"extra depth\". \"Immigrant Song\", released as a single, was backed by the band's only non-album single, \"Hey, Hey, What Can I Do\". Their untitled fourth album, commonly referred to as Led Zeppelin IV, was released in November 1971. Bringing together all the genres from their previous albums, the album contains some of the band's best-known songs, including \"Black Dog\", \"Rock and Roll\", \"Going to California\" and \"Stairway to Heaven\", referred to as one of the greatest rock songs of all time.\nThe band's following albums, Houses of the Holy (1973) and Physical Graffiti (1975), continued the band's musical growth. Houses of the Holy contained a wider range of musical styles, from the ballad \"The Rain Song\" to the funk-inspired \"The Crunge\", while Physical Graffiti was a double album that contained new songs as well as unreleased outtakes from previous albums. The album, like its predecessor, contained a variety of musical styles, including hard rock, funk, acoustic rock, blues, soft and progressive rock, and even country rock. Presence (1976) marked a departure from their previous albums by featuring more straightforward, guitar-driven songs with less emphasis on musical experimentation. In Through the Out Door (1979), a direct contrast to Presence, featured a keyboard-heavy sound that was dominated by Jones. The album would prove to be their last as a band, as after Bonham's death in September 1980, the remaining members decided to disband the group. Coda (1982) is a collection of outtakes from various sessions during the band's career.\nSince their breakup, 26 songs have seen official release. The Led Zeppelin Boxed Set (1990) saw the release of the band's cover of Robert Johnson's \"Travelling Riverside Blues\", the live medley \"White Summer/Black Mountain Side\", and the first album release of \"Hey, Hey, What Can I Do?\"; the second boxed set (1993) saw the release of \"Baby Come On Home\". New songs were also released on BBC Sessions (1997) and its remaster, The Complete BBC Sessions (2015), 2003's Led Zeppelin DVD and the live album How the West Was Won (2003). After the release of the concert film Celebration Day (2012), Page announced the remastering of the band's discography in the form of deluxe editions, which together included 13 previously unreleased songs, some of which were different mixes of previously released songs. The albums were released between 2014 and 2015.\n\n\n== Songs ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAkkerman, Gregg (2014).

Its position was greatly improved by its distribution deal with Stax.

Abramson's wife Miriam ran the label's publishing company, Progressive Music, and did most office duties until 1949 when Atlantic hired its first employee, bookkeeper Francine Wakschal, who remained with the label for the next 49 years. Miriam gained a reputation for toughness. Staff engineer Tom Dowd recalled, \"Tokyo Rose was the kindest name some people had for her\" and Doc Pomus described her as \"an extraordinarily vitriolic woman\". When interviewed in 2009, she attributed her reputation to the company's chronic cash-flow shortage: \"... most of the problems we had with artists were that they wanted advances, and that was very difficult for us ... we were undercapitalized for a long time.\" The label's office in the Ritz Hotel in Manhattan proved too expensive, so they moved to a room in the Hotel Jefferson.

The film stars Hailee Steinfeld, Woody Harrelson, Kyra Sedgwick, and Haley Lu Richardson.\nThe film premiered at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival on September 16, 2016, and was theatrically released on November 18, 2016, by STXfilms.\nIt received positive reviews, with Steinfeld's performance being critically acclaimed. The film grossed more than $19.4 million against a budget of $9 million.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nSeventeen-year-old Nadine Franklin has tempestuous relationships with her popular older brother Darian and her image-conscious mother Mona but was close to her late father Tom. He died of a heart attack when Nadine was thirteen, and her best friend Krista is the only person keeping her buoyed.\nMona travels to the Oregon Coast to meet a boyfriend, and in her absence, Nadine and Krista get extremely drunk. Darian throws a pool party at the house and, after throwing up, Nadine falls asleep while Krista talks to Darian. The next morning, Nadine finds Krista with Darian in bed, straining the girls' friendship. \nThe next day at school, Krista insists Nadine join her at a house party to which Darian has invited her. When they arrive, Darian introduces Krista to other students, leaving Nadine on her own. After failed attempts at mingling, Nadine sits outside with another partygoer, who remarks how inferior Nadine seems compared to her brother, and Nadine leaves the party.\nNadine turns to her classmate Erwin Kim, who has a crush on her. She is attracted to older student Nick Mossman and makes inept attempts to attract him. She invites Erwin to an amusement park, but she rejects his attempt to kiss her. At the end of the night, Nadine tells him he is a great guy and they become friends.\nAt school, Krista confronts Nadine for ignoring her, and Nadine says Darian does not care about Krista and will soon drop her. Krista retorts that Darian has asked her to be his girlfriend and to prom, which is months away. Insecure and desperate, Nadine says Krista must choose between her or Darian. When she refuses to do so, Nadine ends their friendship.\nFor support at school, Nadine turns to world-weary teacher Mr. Bruner, who says she is his favorite student to cheer her up. Nadine goes swimming in Erwin's pool and finds his house is luxurious and his family is wealthy. She learns Erwin is a talented animation filmmaker and accepts his invitation to their school's short-film festival.\nMona has been giving Nadine a ride to school since her falling out with Krista. One day, Nadine refuses to get out of the car when she sees Krista arriving at school at the same time, which leads to Mona bringing Nadine to work with her. There, they argue about her father, and Nadine steals Mona's car. She drives to a playground, writes a sexually explicit text to Nick, and accidentally sends it.\nNadine drives to school and flippantly tells Mr. Bruner she is going to kill herself, and he tries to reassure her. Nick replies to her text, asking her to hang out. Mona calls Darian while he is with Krista and some friends, telling him that Nadine is missing. Darian and Krista leave to find her. \nNick, having taken Nadine's explicit text seriously, attempts to have sex with her in his car. Rejecting him, Nadine runs away and calls Mr. Bruner, who takes her back to his house where they wait for Darian to arrive. Nadine meets Mr. Bruner's wife and child there. Darian tells Nadine he has suffered from the pressures of taking their father's place, saying he feels trapped and did not apply to distant colleges because their mother is so dependent on him. The only person who makes him happy is Krista, but he dislikes that it destroys Nadine for him to be with Krista. Darian asks Mr. Bruner to give Nadine a ride home. Back at their house, Nadine tells Darian about her own feelings of self-hatred and envy. They hug, ending their feud.\n\"Edge of Seventeen\" is a song by the American singer-songwriter Stevie Nicks from her debut solo studio album Bella Donna (1981), released as the third single from the album on February 4, 1982. The lyrics were written by Nicks to express the grief resulting from the death of her uncle Jonathan and the murder of John Lennon during the same week of December 1980. The song features a distinctive, chugging 16th-note guitar riff, drum beat and a simple chord structure typical of Nicks' songs. The song's title for the single release was \"Edge of Seventeen (Just Like the White Winged Dove)\". In the United States, \"Edge of Seventeen\" just missed out on the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 11. Despite this, it became one of Nicks' most enduring and recognizable songs and has been covered by several artists. In 2021, it was ranked No. 217 on Rolling Stone's list of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".\n\n\n== Background and inspiration ==\nAccording to Nicks, the title came from a conversation she had with Tom Petty's first wife, Jane, about the couple's first meeting. Jane said they met \"at the age of seventeen\", but Jane's strong Southern accent made it sound like \"edge of seventeen\" to Nicks. She liked the sound of the phrase so much that she told Jane she would write a song for it and give her credit for the inspiration.\nAlthough Nicks had originally planned to use the title for a song about Tom and Jane Petty, the death of her uncle Jonathan and the murder of John Lennon during the same week of December 1980 inspired a new song for which Nicks used the title. Nicks' producer and lover Jimmy Iovine was a close friend of Lennon, and Nicks felt helpless to comfort him. Soon after, Nicks flew home to Phoenix, Arizona, to be with her uncle Jonathan, who was dying of cancer. She remained with her uncle and his family until his death.\nNicks had never actually heard a dove's call before, as she revealed in 2020 when she had only just heard it recently. The opening lyrics were inspired by a menu she was reading at a Phoenix restaurant in 1980, which said, \"The white wing dove sings a song that sounds like she’s singing ooh, ooh, ooh. She makes her home here in the great Saguaro cactus that provides shelter and protection for her…\".\n\n\n== Composition and lyrics ==\nAs is typical of Nicks' songs, the lyrics are highly symbolic. Nicks has said that the white-winged dove represents the spirit leaving the body on death, and some of the verses capture her experience of the days leading up to her uncle Jonathan's death.\n\nThroughout the song, a distinctive 16th note guitar riff is played by Waddy Wachtel, progressing through C, D, and E-minor chords. During the bridge, the chords alternate twice between E-minor and C. Nicks's backing band recommended that they emulate The Police's \"Bring On the Night\" for the guitar riff, although Wachtel was unfamiliar with the song.\"I had never heard \"Bring On the Night,\" and at that session they told me they were going to do this song based on this feel. I had heard something about the Police, but I didn't know what they were talking about. Then about two years ago, I had the radio on, and on comes what sounds like \"Edge of Seventeen\" – and all of a sudden, there's Sting's voice! I thought, 'We ripped them off completely!' I called Stevie that night and said, 'Listen to me, don't ever do that again!'\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRecord World praised the song for its \"powerful lyrics, a percolating rhythm section and Stevie's throaty vocal.\" Author Zoe Howe has described the song as being about \"transforming and elevating the feelings of grief and soaring above them with strength\" and being \"a perfect combination of tough rock 'n' roll grit, raw emotion and full-beam, strut-about-in-platform-boots rock queen glamour.\"\nThe song is a favourite among Nicks' fanbase.\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\n\"Edge of Seventeen\" peaked at No. 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks in April 1982. The live version on the B-side \nEdge of Seventeen is a 1998 coming of age romantic comedy-drama film directed by David Moreton, written by Moreton and Todd Stephens, starring Chris Stafford, and co-starring Tina Holmes and Andersen Gabrych.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nSandusky, Ohio, 1984: Eric Hunter is a Eurythmics-obsessed, musically driven teenager coming to terms with his sexual identity. When Eric and his best friend, Maggie, accept summer jobs in food service at the local amusement park, they befriend their lesbian manager, Angie, and gay college student, Rod. Sparks fly between the two boys, even as Maggie waits patiently in the wings for Eric's affections. Eric and Rod eventually go on a date that ends at a motel, but then Rod promptly heads back to Ohio State. The encounter leaves Eric with mixed feelings, but he is now more sure of his sexuality.\nAfter beginning his senior year of high school, Eric starts to change up his appearance by letting Maggie dye the top half of his hair blonde, and wearing edgier and more effeminate clothes. This raises eyebrows with his loving parents, but Eric learns that his mom is going to get a part-time job at a local movie multiplex to help send him to study music in New York. While at a party with Maggie, several guys from their school call Eric gay slurs that cause him to leave. Later that night, Eric ventures out to the local gay disco \"The Universal\", a hopping joint run by none other than his old boss, Angie, who tells him not to worry about what everyone else thinks. He dances with a guy who takes him out to his car where the guy gives Eric a rim job, but then leaves shortly afterwards. Stung by a meaningless sexual experience, he calls Rod, who at first seems happy to hear from him, but then tells Eric that he probably shouldn't call him anymore. Eric then goes to Maggie's house where he finally tells her that he is gay. Maggie does not seem to be that surprised since she suspected Eric's relationship with Rod, but she comforts him nevertheless.\nEric starts visiting the bar frequently, where he feels accepted by Angie and her close circle of friends. While waiting to meet up with Maggie one night, Eric clicks with a local college student named Jonathan. When Maggie finally comes to the club, she is heckled by Angie's friends for being Eric's \"fag hag\", and leaves. Eric follows Maggie, but she is upset at him for previously leading her on. Eric goes back to the club to find Jonathan, only to discover that he is already gone. He goes to the Ohio State dorms in hopes of finding him, but decides to find Rod instead. They go back to Rod's room where they have sex. Eric is shown to be uncomfortable during it, and leaves after Rod falls asleep.\nWhen Eric goes home, he is ambushed by his mother, Bonnie, about his recent behavior and appearance, and says that people are getting the wrong idea about him. Eric leaves, and goes to see Angie. While at her house, Angie explains to Eric that it is difficult to accept yourself for who you really are, and that he should give himself some time. He reconciles with Maggie, but quickly realizes that it was a mistake after sleeping together. Crestfallen at his rejection and his willingness to toy with her affections, Maggie ends the friendship. After she leaves, Eric's mother confronts him about a pair of matches she found in his clothes that were from the bar. He quickly denies ever going to the Universal, and leaves. When Eric finally comes home, he finds his mother playing on the piano. He comes out to her; feeling a weight being lifted off his shoulders.\nEric later goes back to the bar just as Angie begins to sing.

Released on July 27, 1981, the album peaked at number one on the US Billboard 200 in September of that year. Bella Donna was awarded platinum status by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on October 7, 1981, less than three months after its release, and in 1990 was certified quadruple-platinum for four million copies shipped. Bella Donna spent nearly three years on the Billboard 200, from July 1981 to June 1984.\nThe album spawned four hit singles during 1981 and 1982: the Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers-penned duet \"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\" (number 3), the Don Henley duet \"Leather and Lace\" (number 6), along with \"Edge of Seventeen\" (number 11) and the country-tinged \"After the Glitter Fades\" (number 32).\nBella Donna would mark the beginning of Nicks' trend of calling upon her many musician friends and connections to fully realize her sparse demo recordings. Along with friends Tom Petty and Don Henley, Nicks brought in session musician Waddy Wachtel, Bruce Springsteen's E-Street Band pianist Roy Bittan, and Stax session man Donald \"Duck\" Dunn of Booker T. & the MGs. The album marked the first recording featuring Nicks' backing vocalists, Sharon Celani and Lori Perry, who still record and tour with Nicks today.\nThe album was also included in the \"Greatest of All Time Billboard 200 Albums\" chart.\n\n\n== History ==\nNicks began work on Bella Donna in 1979, in between sessions for Fleetwood Mac's Tusk album, released in October that year. Nicks recorded various demo versions of songs in early and mid-1980 but these recordings were not used on the album. Following the end of the Tusk tour on September 1, 1980, work with a full band commenced under producer Jimmy Iovine.\nNicks recalled that the album was recorded piecemeal since several of the session musicians, including Waddy Watchel and Russ Kunkel, were operating under a tight schedule. \"We didn't put on 50,000 guitars because we didn't have Waddy around long enough to do 50,000 guitar overdubs. We were lucky to get him to do one guitar part.\" The Bella Donna recording sessions also presented Nicks with an opportunity to work on arrangements without Lindsey Buckingham, who extensively assisted with arrangements on her Fleetwood Mac material. For Bella Donna, Nicks instead allowed the session musicians to develop their own ideas for the instrumentation based on the demos she created.\nRecording sessions continued until the spring of 1981 when the final songs for the album were completed: \"Edge of Seventeen\" and \"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\". The 10-song, 42-minute album Bella Donna was released in the summer of 1981. Nicks wrote \"Think About It\" for her friend and Fleetwood Mac bandmate Christine McVie during the Rumours recording sessions, but the song was never completed until Bella Donna. After the Glitter Fades was Nicks' oldest song on the record, having been written in 1972, while \"Think About It\", \"Leather and Lace\", and \"Highway Man\" were written in 1975.\nA number of finished songs did not make it on the album, including \"Blue Lamp\", which was released instead on Heavy Metal soundtrack later in 1981, and \"Sleeping Angel\", released on the Fast Times at Ridgemont High soundtrack in 1982. These two songs were included on Nicks' Enchanted boxed set in 1998, along with another unused Bella Donna session song, \"Gold and Braid\". Three more songs from these sessions, \"If You Were My Love\", \"Belle Fleur\" and \"The Dealer\", were finally released on Nicks' album 24 Karat Gold: Songs from the Vault (2014). In total, Nicks recorded 16 songs for the album, of which ten were selected for Bella Donna.\nOn her Enchanted boxed set release in 1998, remastered versions of some Bella Donna tracks ran noticeably longer in some instances, notably \"Leather and Lace\". Video footage of the album sessions can be found on the DVD portion of Nicks' retrospective release Crystal Visions – The \nHailee Steinfeld (born December 11, 1996) is an American actress, singer and songwriter.

There weren't any boys my age, so I spent a lot of time by myself, imagining things. And every time we would get established somewhere, we would move. Life just started to get good in seventh grade, and then we moved to Chicago. I ended up in a really big high school, and I didn't know anybody. But then The Beatles came along and changed my whole life. And then Bob Dylan's Bringing It All Back Home came out and really changed me. Thursday I was one person, and Friday I was another. My heroes were Dylan, John Lennon and Picasso, because they each moved their particular medium forward, and when they got to the point where they were comfortable, they always moved on.\n\nIn 1963, Hughes's family moved to Northbrook, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. There, his father found work selling roofing materials. Hughes attended Grove Middle School, later going on to Glenbrook North High School, which gave him inspiration for the films that eventually made his reputation. He met Nancy Ludwig, a cheerleader and his future wife, in high school. As a teenager, Hughes turned to movies as an escape. According to childhood friend Jackson Peterson, \"His mom and dad criticized him a lot (...) She [Marion] would be critical of what John would want to do\". Hughes was a fan of the Beatles, and allegedly knew a lot about movies and the Rat Pack.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 1970–1981: Rise to prominence ===\nAfter dropping out of the University of Arizona, Hughes began selling jokes to well-established performers such as Rodney Dangerfield and Joan Rivers. Hughes used his jokes to get an entry-level job at Needham, Harper & Steers as an advertising copywriter in Chicago in 1970 and later in 1974 at Leo Burnett Worldwide. During this period, he created what became the famous Edge \"Credit Card Shaving Test\" ad campaign.\nHughes's work on the Virginia Slims account frequently took him to the Philip Morris headquarters in New York City, which allowed him to visit the offices of National Lampoon magazine.

As Carly, the team's tactician, she assumes the life of a stay-at-home single mother.\nCooper played a main character in Apple TV+'s See (2019–2022), about a post-apocalyptic world where most of humanity is blind.

The subsequent year, Kenan Thompson speculated that the series may end if Michaels left, saying, \"He's the one that's had his touch on the whole thing . . . It opens the opportunity for a lot of bullshit to come into the game because he's such a legend that he keeps off those corporate wolves.\" During season forty-nine, Michaels suggested that 2000s-era member Tina Fey could take over, but insisted that he would finish the next season before any dramatic changes. He reiterated these plans in May, when a fiftieth anniversary special was announced that would celebrate the series' history on February 16, 2025.

Coming-of-age stories tend to emphasize dialogue or internal monologue over action and are often set in the past. The subjects of coming-of-age stories are typically teenagers. The Bildungsroman is a specific subgenre of coming-of-age story.\nThe plot points of coming-of-age stories are usually emotional changes within the character(s) in question.\n\n\n== Bildungsroman ==\n\nIn literary criticism, coming-of-age novels and Bildungsroman are sometimes interchangeable, but the former is usually a wider genre. The Bildungsroman (from the German words Bildung, \"education\", alternatively \"forming\" and Roman, \"novel\") is further characterized by a number of formal, topical, and thematic features. It focuses on the psychological and moral growth of the protagonist from childhood to adulthood (coming of age), in which character change is important.\nThe genre evolved from folk tales of young children exploring the world to find their fortune. Although the Bildungsroman arose in Germany, it has had extensive influence first in Europe and later throughout the world. Thomas Carlyle had translated Goethe's Wilhelm Meister novels into English, and after their publication in 1824/1825, many British authors wrote novels inspired by it.\nMany variations of the Bildungsroman exist, such as the Künstlerroman (\"artist novel\"), which focuses on the self-growth of an artist.\n\n\n== Teen films ==\nIn film, coming-of-age is a genre of teen films. Coming-of-age films focus on the psychological and moral growth or transition of a protagonist from youth to adulthood. A variant in the 2020s is the \"delayed-coming-of-age film, a kind of story that acknowledges the deferred nature of 21st-century adulthood\", in which young adults may still be exploring short-term relationships, living situations, and jobs even into their late 20s and early 30s.\nPersonal growth and change is an important characteristic of the genre, which relies on dialogue and emotional responses, rather than action. The story is sometimes told in the form of a flashback. Historically, coming-of-age films usually centred on young boys, although coming-of-age films focusing on girls have become more common in the early 21st century, such as The Poker House (2008), Winter's Bone (2010), Hick (2011), Girlhood (2014), Mustang (2015), Inside Out (2015), The Diary of a Teenage Girl (2015), Mistress America (2015), The Edge of Seventeen (2016), Lady Bird (2017), Sweet 20 (2017), Aftersun (2022) and Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret. (2023).\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of coming-of-age stories\n\n\n== References ==\nSurvivor is the third studio album by American girl group Destiny's Child. It was released on April 25, 2001, by Columbia Records. As their breakthrough second studio album The Writing's on the Wall (1999) became a rising commercial success, Destiny's Child faced the controversial departure of original members LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson, who were replaced with Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams, in February 2000. Soon afterwards, they commenced production of their third studio album, tentatively titled Independent Women.\nMere five months after joining, Franklin departed from the group in July, and \"Independent Women Part I\" was subsequently released as a single from the accompanying soundtrack for the film Charlie's Angels (2000). The song became a global commercial success and the group's third US Billboard Hot 100 number-one single. Retitling the album Survivor in reference to the turmoil surrounding their line-up alterations, Destiny's Child enlisted producers such as Anthony Dent, Damon Elliott, Mark J. Feist, Rob Fusari and Keybeats alongside Beyoncé Knowles, who produced all and co-wrote nearly all of the album's tracks. Their final product was an R&B and pop record incorporating genres such as dance, funk and hip hop. Its lyrical themes explore dynamics between women, self-esteem, independence and romantic relationships.\nUpon its release, Survivor received generally positive reviews, mostly aimed at its production, while its balladry, length and lyrical content ignited criticism. Retrospective critical commentaries have credited the record for its impact on mainstream music of the 2000s and for serving as foundation for Knowles' eventual solo career. A global commercial success, the album debuted atop the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 663,000 units, becoming Destiny's Child's first and only number-one studio album on the chart. It has gone on to be certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). At the 44th Annual Grammy Awards (2002), the album was nominated for Best R&B Album. By the end of 2001, it had sold over three million copies worldwide, being among the best-selling girl group albums of all time.\nSurvivor produced four singles. Its title track peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 and reached the top ten in 18 additional countries. In 2002, it won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. \"Bootylicious\" became Destiny's Child's fourth US Billboard Hot 100 number-one single and attained international success. \"Emotion\" became a US Billboard Hot 100 top-ten hit in the wake of the September 11 attacks, while \"Nasty Girl\" was released only overseas and achieved moderate success. The album was further promoted with the co-headlining Total Request Live Tour (2001) and the Destiny's Child World Tour (2002). After the latter's conclusion, the group embarked on a two-year hiatus, during which each member released a solo studio album to varying levels of success.\n\n\n== Background and development ==\nIn July 1999, Destiny's Child released their second studio album The Writing's on the Wall. Their breakthrough record, it debuted at number six on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 133,000 units. In December, LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson tried to split with Destiny's Child's manager Mathew Knowles, claiming that he was keeping too much of the group's profits and that he favored his daughter Beyoncé Knowles and Kelly Rowland. When the accompanying music video for \"Say My Name\" premiered in February 2000, Roberson and Luckett found out that they were being replaced with Michelle Williams, a former backing vocalist for Monica, and Farrah Franklin, an aspiring singer-actress. On March 15, Roberson and Luckett filed a lawsuit against Mathew Knowles and their former bandmates for breach of partnership and fiduciary duties. Following the lawsuit, both sides were disparaging towards each other in the media.

Founded in March 2014 by film producer Robert Simonds, the studio produces film, television, and digital media projects.\nIn April 2020, STX announced that it would merge with the Indian studio Eros International plc. The merger was completed in July 2020, and STX became a division of ErosSTX. In December 2021, Jahm Najafi announced his intention to acquire STX from the merged company for $173 million–a sale completed in April 2022. Eros remains a minority, non-voting shareholder.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2012, Simonds and McGlashan began work on conceptualizing a media company based on the idea of producing medium-budget projects with a star attached, a method that had gone out of style with Hollywood studios. The conversation led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014, with the mission to finance, develop, produce, market, and distribute star-driven content around the world. Investors in the company included Hony Capital, Tencent, PCCW, TPG Growth, RTL Group and Liberty Global. Individual investors include Gigi Pritzker, Beau Wrigley, and Dominic Ng.\nIn September 2017, it was reported that STX was considering an initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (SEHK). It was reported that a listing on the SEHK could bring STX closer to Chinese investors and audiences. The Wall Street Journal stated that the company could be valued at $3.5 billion, after raising an additional $500 million following the IPO. In April 2018, the company filed for an IPO on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.\nSTX called off its IPO in October 2018, citing the China–U.S. trade war, and conditions having deteriorated in Hong Kong due to turbulence in the mainland Chinese equity market.  An overall co-funding agreement with Chinese company Huayi Brothers Media lapsed at the end of 2018, and in April 2019, co-founder Bill McGlashan was fired due to his being indicted in the college admissions bribery scandal.\nIn April 2020, STX announced that it would merge with the Indian film and television studio Eros International plc. Simonds stated that the merger would create \"the first independent media company with the expertise and creative cultures of Hollywood and Bollywood, while also leveraging the important inroads both companies have made into the Chinese market.\" The combined company would be publicly traded, inheriting Eros' listing on the New York Stock Exchange. The merger was closed on July 30, 2020; the combined company unveiled a new logo and branding as ErosSTX in September. The combined entity raised $125 million of new equity funding and received $350 million in credit led by JPMorgan.\nIn December 2021, amid financial shortcomings following the merger, Jahm Najafi's Najafi Companies announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire STX Entertainment from ErosSTX for $173 million. However, in late January 2022, Lionsgate also emerged as a potential suitor, looking to absorb either part or whole of STX, but the deal was later rejected, leaving only Najafi as a potential suitor. In April 2022, Najafi Companies completed its acquisition of STX Entertainment. Eros Media World will retain a 15% non-voting stake in the company. In July 2022, shortly after STX's motion picture chairman Adam Fogelson departed for the studio, Deadline reported that STX was in talks with Lionsgate over a potential film distribution deal. Shortly after, it was reported that STX Entertainment's U.K. offices, including the London office housing STXinternational's headquarters, were gradually shutting down. Following the departure of STXinternational head John Friedberg to join Black Bear Pictures' international division, it was announced the latter company was nearing a deal with STX to handle part of its slate internationally. In November 2022, It was reported that STX's distribution and marketing operations would be shuttered and that Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre would go to a streaming\nLea DeLaria (born May 23, 1958) is an American comedian, actress, and jazz singer.

The lyrics were written by Nicks to express the grief resulting from the death of her uncle Jonathan and the murder of John Lennon during the same week of December 1980. The song features a distinctive, chugging 16th-note guitar riff, drum beat and a simple chord structure typical of Nicks' songs.

In the United States, \"Edge of Seventeen\" just missed out on the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 11.

She liked the sound of the phrase so much that she told Jane she would write a song for it and give her credit for the inspiration.\nAlthough Nicks had originally planned to use the title for a song about Tom and Jane Petty, the death of her uncle Jonathan and the murder of John Lennon during the same week of December 1980 inspired a new song for which Nicks used the title.

It focuses on the psychological and moral growth of the protagonist from childhood to adulthood (coming of age), in which character change is important.\nThe genre evolved from folk tales of young children exploring the world to find their fortune. Although the Bildungsroman arose in Germany, it has had extensive influence first in Europe and later throughout the world. Thomas Carlyle had translated Goethe's Wilhelm Meister novels into English, and after their publication in 1824/1825, many British authors wrote novels inspired by it.\nMany variations of the Bildungsroman exist, such as the Künstlerroman (\"artist novel\"), which focuses on the self-growth of an artist."
