{"page_content": "Reprise Records is an American record label founded in 1960 by Frank Sinatra. It is owned by Warner Music Group, and operates through Warner Records, one of its flagship labels.\nArtists currently signed to Reprise Records include Green Day, Enya, Michael Bubl\u00e9, Eric Clapton, Stevie Nicks, Neil Young, Deftones, Mastodon, Lindsey Buckingham, Josh Groban, Disturbed, Idina Menzel, My Chemical Romance, Gerard Way, Dwight Yoakam, Never Shout Never, and Billy Strings.\n\n\n== Company history ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings ===\n\nReprise Records was formed in 1960 by Frank Sinatra in order to allow more artistic freedom for his own recordings. Soon thereafter, he garnered the nickname \"The Chairman of the Board\". Because of dissatisfaction with Capitol Records, and after trying to buy Norman Granz's Verve Records, the first album Sinatra released on Reprise was Ring-a-Ding-Ding! As CEO of Reprise, Sinatra recruited several artists for the fledgling label, such as fellow Rat Pack members Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. The original roster from 1961 to 1963 included Bing Crosby, Jo Stafford, Rosemary Clooney, Duke Ellington, Nancy Sinatra, Esquivel and stand-up comedian Redd Foxx. The original Reprise LP label had four different logos, depending on the genre: a riverboat for Pop records (pictured), a cherub for Jazz records, an owl for Spoken Word/Comedy records, and a picture of Sinatra for his records.\n\nOne of the label's founding principles under Sinatra's leadership was that each artist would have full creative freedom, and at some point complete ownership of their work, including publishing rights. This is the reason why recordings of early Reprise artists (Dean Martin, Jimi Hendrix, the Kinks, etc.) are (in most cases) currently distributed through other labels. In Martin's case, his Reprise recordings were out of print for nearly 20 years before a deal was struck with Capitol Records. Reprise continued to reissue the Sinatra catalog until 2013 when it was sold to Capitol.\n\n\n=== Sale to Warner Bros. ===\nIn August 1963, as part of a film deal, Warner Bros. purchased Reprise (which had been losing money) from Frank Sinatra, who nonetheless retained a 1/3 interest in the label. Many of the older artists on the label were dropped by Warner Bros. Records. Reprise president Mo Ostin was retained as the head of the label and he went on to play a very significant role in the history of the Warner group of labels over the next four decades. Warner-Reprise executives began targeting younger acts, beginning by securing the American distribution rights to the Pye Records recordings by the Kinks in 1964. Reprise soon added teen-oriented pop acts like Dino, Desi & Billy to the roster. As well, Sinatra's own daughter Nancy (who began recording for the label in 1961) was retained by Ostin, becoming a major pop star from late 1965. The label moved almost exclusively to rock-oriented music in the late 1960s, although Frank Sinatra continued to record for the label until the 1980s.\nThrough direct signings or distribution deals, by the 1970s the Reprise roster grew to include Lee Hazlewood, Jill Jackson, Jimi Hendrix, the early Joni Mitchell recordings, Neil Young, the Electric Prunes, Donna Loren, Arlo Guthrie, Norman Greenbaum, Tom Lehrer, Kenny Rogers and The First Edition, Tiny Tim, Ry Cooder, Captain Beefheart, John Sebastian, Family, the early 1970s recordings by Frank Zappa and the Mothers, Gram Parsons, Emmylou Harris, Nico's Desertshore, the Fugs, Jethro Tull, Pentangle, T. Rex, the Meters, John Cale, Gordon Lightfoot, Michael Franks, Richard Pryor, Al Jarreau, Fleetwood Mac, Fanny, and the Beach Boys.\n\n\n=== Dormancy ===\n\nIn 1976, the Reprise label was deactivated by Warner Bros. and all of its roster (except Frank Sinatra and Neil Young) was moved to the main Warner Bros. label. Although older catalog albums continued to be manufactured with the Reprise logo, and albums by the Beach Boys on Brother Records were issued in the Reprise catalog numbering seque\nThis is a list of current and former artists who have recorded for Reprise Records or one of its associated labels.\n\n\n== 0\u20139 ==\n40 Below Summer\n54-40\n8stops7\n\n\n== A ==\na-ha\nAhmad (Giant/Reprise)\nAimee Mann\nAir Supply (Giant/Reprise)\nAkina Nakamori\nAl Jarreau\nAlanis Morissette (Maverick/Reprise)\nAlexander Zonjic\nAllen Sherman\nAllen Toussaint\nAmerican Bang\nAmerican Music Club\nAnanda Shankar\nAndreas Johnson\nArkarna\nArlo Guthrie\nArmy of Lovers (Giant/Reprise) (US/Canada)\nArt of Dying (Intoxication/Reprise)\nAsh (North America)\nAtlantic Starr\n\n\n== B ==\nThe B-52s\nBabble\nBabes in Toyland\nBaker Knight\nBarenaked Ladies\nBarney Kessel\nBash & Pop (Sire/Reprise)\nBeatmasters (Rhythm King/Sire/Reprise)\nBelly (Sire/Reprise)\nBen Webster\nBert Jansch\nBeth Nielsen Chapman\nBetty Boo (Rhythm King/Sire/Reprise) (US/Canada)\nBig Country (Giant/Reprise) (US/Canada)\nBig Daddy Kane (Cold Chillin'/Reprise)\nBig Head Todd and the Monsters (Giant/Reprise)\nBigod 20 (Sire/Reprise)\nBill Miller\nBilly Corgan\nBilly Hill (Reprise Nashville)\nBilly Strings\nBing Crosby\nBlack Sabbath (US/Canada)\nBlake Shelton (Reprise Nashville)\nBloodsimple (Bullygoat/Reprise)\nBob Mosley\nBoDeans (Slash/Reprise)\nBone Thugs-N-Harmony (Asylum/Reprise)\nBonnie McKee\nBook of Love\nBoredoms\nBrady Seals\nBrian Wilson (Sire/Reprise)\nBrowning Bryant\nBryan Ferry (US/Canada)\nBT (Perfecto/Kinetic/Reprise)\nBuddy Ebsen\nBuddy Greco\nBulletboys\n\n\n== C ==\nCaleb Kane\nCaptain Beefheart\nCarlene Carter (Giant/Reprise Nashville)\nCavo\nChaka Khan\nCharice Pempengco\nCharice\nCharles Aznavour\nCharlie Daniels\nCher (US/Australia)\nChicago (Full Moon/Reprise)\nChris Cummings\nChris Isaak\nClaudia Church\nColdcut (Tommy Boy/Reprise)\nColor Me Badd (Giant/Reprise)\nCount Basie\nCraig David (US)\nCrime Mob (Crunk Incorporated/Reprise)\n\n\n== D ==\nDa Bush Babees\nDaddy Cool\nDario G (Kinetic/Reprise)\nDave Gahan (Mute/Reprise) (US/Canada/Mexico)\nDavid Lee Roth\nDavid Sanborn\nDean Martin\nDeborah Harry (Sire/Reprise)\nDebbie Reynolds\nDeftones\nDel Reeves\nDennis Robbins\nDenny Laine (US/Canada)\nDepeche Mode (Mute/Sire/Reprise) (US/Canada/Mexico)\nDevendra Banhart\nDinah Shore\nDino, Desi & Billy\nDio (US/Canada)\nDisturbed\nDivine Styler (Giant/Reprise)\nDon Ho & the Allies\nDonald Fagen\nDonna Loren\nDrill Team\nDuane Eddy\nDuke Ellington\nDwight Yoakam (Reprise Nashville)\n\n\n== E ==\nEd Sanders\nEddi Reader\nEisley\nElla Fitzgerald\nEmmylou Harris (Reprise Nashville)\nEnya\nEnya (US)\nErasure (Mute/Sire/Reprise) (US/Canada/Mexico)\nEric Ben\u00e9t (Friday/Reprise)\nEric Clapton (Duck/Reprise)\nEsquivel!\nEssra Mohawk\nEsthero\nEthel Merman\nEddie Cano\n\n\n== F ==\nFaith No More (Slash/Reprise)\nFamily\nFamily of the Year\nFanny\nFats Domino\nFilter\nFleetwood Mac\nFlo & Eddie\nForce MDs (Tommy Boy/Reprise)\nFran\u00e7oise Hardy (US and Canada, leased from Vogue)\nFrank Sinatra (Founder) \nFrank Zappa (Bizarre/Reprise)\nFrankie Ballard (Reprise Nashville)\n\n\n== G ==\nGerard Way\nGloriana (Emblem/Reprise Nashville)\nGoldie Hawn\nGordon Jenkins\nGordon Lightfoot\nGrace (Perfecto/Kinetic/Reprise)\nGram Parsons\nGrand Daddy I.U.

In Baroque music this usually occurs at the very end of a piece, repeating the final phrase with added ornamentation.\n\n\n== Song reprises ==\nReprise can refer to a version of a song which is similar to, yet different from, the song on which it is based. One example could be \"Time\", the fourth song from Pink Floyd's 1973 album The Dark Side of the Moon, which contains a reprise of \"Breathe\", the second song of the same album. Another example could be \"Solo\", the fifth song from Frank Ocean's 2016 album Blonde, and then \"Solo (Reprise)\", the tenth song of the same album. Be Here Now, the 1997 album by Oasis, features a reprise of \"All Around the World\", while the title track of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which plays at the start of the album to introduce it, has a reprise at the end of the album to close it by replacing lines like \"we hope you will enjoy the show\" with \"we hope you have enjoyed the show\". Impera by Ghost features a reprise on the final track, \"Respite on the Spitalfields\", of a riff previously featured in the opening track, \"Imperium\".\n\n\n=== Musical theater ===\nIn musical theatre, reprises are any repetition of an earlier song or theme, usually with changed lyrics and shortened music to reflect the development of the story. Also, it is common for songs sung by the same character or regarding the same narrative motif to have similar tunes and lyrics, or incorporate similar tunes and lyrics. For example, in the stage version of Les Mis\u00e9rables, a song of the primary antagonist (\"Javert's Suicide\") is similar in lyrics and exactly the same in tune to a soliloquy of the protagonist when he was in a similar emotional state (\"What Have I Done?\"). At the end of the song, an instrumental portion is played from an earlier soliloquy of the antagonist, in which he was significantly more confident. Les Mis\u00e9rables in general reprises many musical themes..\nOften the reprised version of a song has exactly the same tune and lyrics as the original, though frequently featuring different characters singing or including them with the original character in the reprised version. For example, in The Sound of Music, the reprise of the title song is sung by the Von Trapp children and their father, the Captain; whereas the original was sung by Maria. In \"Edelweiss\" (reprise), the entire Von Trapp family and Maria sing and are later joined by the audience, whereas the original features Liesl and the Captain..\nAlso, in the musical The Music Man, the love song \"Goodnight My Someone\" uses the same basic melody (though with a more ballad quality to it) as the rousing march and theme song \"Seventy-Six Trombones\"; in the reprised versions, Harold and Marian are heard singing a snatch of each other's songs. And in Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II's Show Boat, the song \"Ol' Man River\" is reprised three times after it is first sung, as if it were a commentary on the situation in the story. In some musicals, a reprise of an earlier song is sung by a different character from the one who originally sang it, with different lyrics.\nIn Mamma Mia!, however, the reprises for the title track, Dancing Queen, and Waterloo have no altering of the lyrics, and are just shortened versions of the originals featured earlier.\nIn RENT, the song, \"I'll Cover You\" gets a reprise at Angel's funeral. It is sung primarily by Collins and is slower and more emotional to reflect Collins' emotional state. Nearing the end of the song, the rest of the company begins singing a slower version of the first verse of \"Sea\nWarner Records Inc. (known as Warner Bros. Records Inc. until 2019) is an American record label.  A subsidiary of the Warner Music Group, it is headquartered in Los Angeles, California. It was founded on March 19, 1958, as the recorded music division of the American film studio Warner Bros.\nArtists who have recorded for Warner Records include  Madonna, Prince, Linkin Park, Zach Bryan, Van Halen, Kylie Minogue, ZZ Top, Gorillaz, Bette Midler, Grateful Dead, Jane's Addiction, Duran Duran, Fleetwood Mac, Rod Stewart, Funkadelic, James Taylor,  Red Hot Chili Peppers, Mac Miller, R.E.M., Bob James, David Sanborn, and the Sex Pistols.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\nAt the end of the silent movie period, Warner Bros. Pictures decided to expand into publishing and recording so that it could access low-cost music content for its films. In 1928, the studio acquired several smaller music publishing firms which included M. Witmark & Sons, Harms Inc., and a partial interest in New World Music Corp., and merged them to form the Music Publishers Holding Company. This new group controlled valuable copyrights on standards by George and Ira Gershwin and Jerome Kern, and the new division was soon earning solid profits of up to US$2 million every year.\nIn 1930, Music Publishers Holding Company (MPHC) paid US$28 million to acquire Brunswick Records (which included Vocalion), whose roster included Duke Ellington, Red Nichols, Nick Lucas, Al Jolson, Earl Burtnett, Ethel Waters, Abe Lyman, Leroy Carr, Tampa Red and Memphis Minnie, and soon after the sale to Warner Bros., the label signed rising radio and recording stars Bing Crosby, Mills Brothers, and Boswell Sisters. Unfortunately for Warner Bros., the dual impact of the Great Depression and the introduction of broadcast radio greatly harmed the recording industry\u2014sales crashed, dropping by around 90% from more than 100 million records in 1927 to fewer than 10 million by 1932 and major companies were forced to halve the price of records from 75 to 35 cents.\nIn December 1931, Warner Bros. offloaded Brunswick to the American Record Corporation (ARC) for a fraction of its former value, in a lease arrangement which did not include Brunswick's pressing plants. Technically, Warner maintained actual ownership of Brunswick, which with the sale of ARC to CBS in 1939 and their decision to discontinue Brunswick in favor of reviving the Columbia label, reverted to Warner Bros. Warner Bros. sold Brunswick a second time (along with Brunswick's back catalog up to 1931) in 1941, this time along with the old Brunswick pressing plants Warner owned, to Decca Records (which formed its American operations in 1934) in exchange for a financial interest in Decca. The heavy loss it incurred in the Brunswick deal kept the studio out of the record business for almost 20 years, and during this period it licensed its film music to other companies for release as soundtrack albums.\n\n\n=== 1958\u20131963: formation and early years ===\n  \nWarner Bros. returned to the record business on March 19, 1958, with the establishment of its own recording division, Warner Bros. Records. By this time, the established Hollywood studios were reeling from multiple challenges to their former dominance\u2014the most notable being the introduction of television in the late 1940s. Legal changes also had a major impact on their business\u2014lawsuits brought by major stars had effectively overthrown the old studio contract system by the late 1940s and, beginning in 1949, anti-trust suits brought by the U.S. government forced the five major studios to divest their cinema chains.\nIn 1956, Harry Warner and Albert Warner sold their interest in the studio and the board was joined by new members who favored a renewed expansion into the music business\u2014Charles Allen of the investment bank Charles Allen & Company, Serge Semenenko of the First National Bank of Boston and investor David Baird. Semenenko in particular had a strong professional interest in the entertainment \nBrave Belt was a Canadian rock band from Winnipeg, Manitoba originally consisting of Randy Bachman (guitar/vocals), his former Guess Who bandmate, Chad Allan (vocals/keyboards), and Randy's brother Robbie (drums). Randy also provided bass tracks for the recording of the band's first album, Brave Belt (Reprise Records, 1971). C. F. \"Fred\" Turner was added shortly after as bassist for the supporting concerts.\nThe band made the Canadian Top 40 with the minor hit \"Crazy Arms, Crazy Eyes,\" which peaked at No. 35 in November 1971.  However, they missed the U.S. charts completely.\nIn 1972, Turner became the lead vocalist for the Brave Belt II album. Allan left the band after the recording was completed. During the supporting concerts for Brave Belt II, Tim Bachman was added as a second guitarist. Despite the changes, Brave Belt II sold poorly and the band struggled to book live shows. In a 1974 Rolling Stone interview, Randy estimated there were losses of about $150,000 in 1971-72 ($923,000 in 2020 dollars), with himself personally absorbing about 60% of the loss, as he was paying the other band member salaries from his Guess Who royalties.\nAlthough dropped from the Reprise label, the Brave Belt II lineup (C. F. Turner with Randy, Tim and Robbie Bachman) recorded and shopped around a demo that was supposed to be a Brave Belt III album.  New management convinced them to change their name \u2212 they eventually settled on Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive.\nThus, the eponymous first Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album is essentially Brave Belt III, the album that was rejected by Reprise Records. Bachman had contacted many record labels to get the Brave Belt III tapes signed.  Charlie Fach at Mercury eventually listened to the tapes and liked what he heard. Bachman listened to some suggestions, remixed and re-edited the tapes, and the band recorded at least two new songs. The result was the first Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album for Mercury, released in May 1973.\nThough Brave Belt is relatively unknown some 40 years later, the importance of the band was summed up by Randy Bachman in a 2001 interview:\n\"It was an innocent time of soul-searching. Nobody would play with me when I left The Guess Who. I was completely black-listed. I couldn't get a decent musician to play with me, except Chad Allan, who had also been in The Guess Who and left. He and I bonded together, and I might not have gotten started without him, even though he left sometime after that first album. Those [Brave Belt] albums are so important to me because, for the first time, I was making my own music, paying for it, finding strengths in it, and going through the process of finding the right music for the record. It led to me becoming a stronger producer for BTO.\"\nBrave Belt I and Brave Belt II were re-released on a single CD March 17, 2009.\n\n\n== Albums ==\n\n\n=== Brave Belt - Reprise Records - 1971 ===\n\n\n==== Track listing ====\nSide One\n\"Crazy Arms, Crazy Eyes\" - (Randy Bachman) - 2:44\n\"Lifetime\" - (Randy Bachman) - 1:53\n\"Waitin' There For Me\" - (Randy Bachman) - 3:17\n\"I Am The Man\" - (Chad Allan) - 4:03\n\"French Kiss\" - (Chad Allan, Rob Matheson) - 3:46\n\"It's Over\" - (Randy Bachman) - 3:05\nSide Two\n \"Rock And Roll Band\" - (Chad Allan) - 3:52\n\"Wandering Fantasy Girl\" - (Chad Allan) - 2:50\n\"I Wouldn't Trade My Guitar For A Woman\" - (Chad Allan) - 1:47\n\"Holy Train\" - (Chad Allan) - 3:05\n\"Anyday Means Tomorrow\" - (Randy Bachman) - 3:02\n\"Scarecrow\" - (Chad Allan, Rob Matheson) - 5:38\n\n\n==== Personnel ====\nChad Allan - piano, lead (4, 5, 8, 10, 12), co-lead (1, 2, 7, 9) and backing (11) vocals, accordion, rhythm guitar, mandolin\nRandy Bachman - lead guitar, lead (3, 6, 11), co-lead (1, 2, 7, 9) and backing vocals, bass, herzog\nRobbie Bachman - drums (1-8, 10, 11), percussion\nAdditional Personnel\nWally Didduck - fiddle\nRon Halldorson - pedal steel guitar\nBilly Mac - drums (9, 12)\n\n\n=== Brave Belt II - Reprise Records - 1972 ===\n\n\n==== Track listing ====\nSide One\n\"Too Far Away\" - (Randy Bachman) - 3:38\n\nAmerican vocalist Frank Sinatra recorded 59 studio albums and 297 singles in his solo career, spanning 54 years. \nSinatra after having had stints with the quartet The Hoboken Four and with the orchestras of Harry James and Tommy Dorsey, launched a solo career in 1943, signing with Columbia Records; his debut album The Voice of Frank Sinatra was issued in 1946.

Wachtel has worked as session musician for other artists such as Linda Ronstadt, Beth Hart, Stevie Nicks, Kim Carnes, Randy Newman, Keith Richards, The Rolling Stones (lead guitar on \"Saint of Me\"), Jon Bon Jovi, James Taylor, Iggy Pop, Warren Zevon, Bryan Ferry, Michael Sweet, Jackson Browne, Karla Bonoff, and Andrew Gold, both in the studio and live.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nWachtel was born May 24, 1947, in Jackson Heights to a Jewish family in the New York City borough of Queens. At about age 9\u201310, Wachtel began to learn to play the guitar, taking lessons with teacher Gene Dell (who insisted that he learn to play right-handed despite being naturally left-handed) until about age 14. At that age, he says, he began writing songs.\nWachtel also studied with Rudolph Schramm, who was the head of the NBC staff orchestra and went on to teach music at Carnegie Hall. Schramm tried to get Wachtel to take piano lessons, but Wachtel was intent on playing guitar so Schramm agreed to give him guitar lessons three times a week on rhythm, melody and harmony.\nAfter performing with local bands in the New York area, Wachtel formed his own band, The Orphans, who played in Connecticut and New Hampshire. Eventually the band settled into a regular bar band routine, playing in Newport, Rhode Island, where Wachtel took lessons from Sal Salvador. When the Orphans disbanded, he formed another band, Twice Nicely. At the suggestion of Bud Cowsill (of The Cowsills), he brought Twice Nicely to Los Angeles in 1968 where they recorded a few demos, but after two years, Wachtel decided to work as a session player.\n\n\n== Films ==\nIn 1972, he made an appearance in the film The Poseidon Adventure as the acoustic guitar player in a fictitious band on stage in the dining room when the ship capsizes.  Waddy appeared alongside Linda Ronstadt in the 1978 film, FM.  He also played in the Oscar-winning short film, \"Session Man\" in 1991.\nWachtel has composed and played instruments for film scores including Joe Dirt, Up in Smoke, Nice Guys Sleep Alone, The Longest Yard, The Benchwarmers, Grandma's Boy, Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star, Strange Wilderness, The House Bunny, and Paul Blart: Mall Cop. He has also composed, produced, or performed in songs with Warren Zevon, Joe Walsh, Jackson Browne, Linda Ronstadt and others.\n\n\n== Session and touring work ==\nIn 1972, he was hired by Warren Zevon to play guitar on The Everly Brothers' Stories We Could Tell album and join them in a subsequent tour.\nBy 1973, he played with Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks on their first album Buckingham Nicks (credited as 'Waddy', no surname), and on tour. Later, when Nicks and Buckingham joined Fleetwood Mac, he played rhythm guitar on their 1975 album Fleetwood Mac on the track \"Sugar Daddy\".\nIn 1980, he wrote, recorded and sang lead vocals on an album for producer Peter Asher with members of Linda Ronstadt's band, including musicians Don Grolnick, Dan Dugmore, Stanley Sheldon and Rick Marotta. Both the group and the album were titled Ronin. Released on the Mercury label, the record never charted.\nIn 1984, he played on Steve Perry's (Journey) solo album Street Talk.\nHe has appeared on hundreds of albums with many different artists and bands.\nProduction credits include albums by Stevie Nicks, Keith Richards, Jackson Browne, Bryan Ferry, The Church, Sand Rubies, George Thorogood and the Destroyers and Warren Zevon. Wachtel co-wrote several songs with Zevon including \"Werewolves of London\". He also co-wrote the Warren Zevon song \"Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead\" from the album Mr. Bad Example. He performed on all seven Warren Zevon albums from 1976 through 1992, producing or co-producing three.\nWachtel also shares co-writing credits with Stevie Nicks on a few tracks such as \"Annabel Lee\", and \"I Don't Care\".\nWachtel has been credited on some albums as Bob Wach\nJames Lee Keltner (born April 27, 1942) is an American drummer and percussionist known primarily for his session work. He was characterized by Bob Dylan biographer Howard Sounes as \"the leading session drummer in America\".\n\n\n== Career ==\nKeltner was inspired to start playing because of an interest in jazz, but the popularity of jazz was declining during the late 1950s and early 1960s, and it was the explosion of pop/rock in the mid-1960s that enabled him to break into recording work in Los Angeles. His first gig as a session musician was recording \"She's Just My Style\" for the pop group Gary Lewis and the Playboys.\nKeltner's music career was hardly paying a living, and for several years at the outset he was supported by his wife. Toward the end of the 1960s, he finally began getting regular session work and eventually became one of the busiest drummers in Los Angeles. His earliest credited performances on record were with Gabor Szabo on the 1968 album Bacchanal.\nIn 1968, Keltner was also working in a music shop in Pasadena just down the street from the old Ice House coffeehouse when he was recruited to play drums in a \"psychedelic\" vocal group named \"MC Squared\" along with Michael Crowley, Michael Clough, Linda Carey\u2014all from the folk group The Back Porch Majority)\u2014and session guitarist/bassist Randy Cierley Sterling. They were signed by Mo Ostin and recorded an album for Warner/Reprise originally titled \"MC Squared\" which has later been re-mastered and re-released in 2012 with the album title \"Tantalizing Colors.\" They appeared live that same year on the Hugh Hefner / Playboy Magazine television show Playboy After Dark, playing two songs:  an original by MC Squared members Michael Clough and Michael Crowley titled \"I Know You\" and a version of the Fred Neil song Everybody's Talkin'.  Both Playboy After Dark performances with Keltner playing drums can currently be viewed on YouTube.\nIt was his work with Leon Russell playing on Delaney & Bonnie's Accept No Substitute that attracted the attention of Joe Cocker, who recruited Russell and everyone else he could out of the Delaney & Bonnie band for his  Mad Dogs & Englishmen tour. Playing with Joe Cocker led to work in 1970 and 1971, on records by Carly Simon (No Secrets), Barbra Streisand (Barbra Joan Streisand), Booker T. Jones (Booker T. & Priscilla), George Harrison (The Concert for Bangladesh) and John Lennon (Imagine).\n\n\n=== Former Beatles ===\nKeltner is known for his session work on solo recordings by three members of the Beatles, working with George Harrison, John Lennon (including Lennon solo albums, as well as albums released both by the Plastic Ono Band and Yoko Ono), and Ringo Starr.\nKeltner played on many former Beatle solo releases, including Harrison's 1973 album Living in the Material World and Lennon's 1974 album Walls and Bridges. When Ringo Starr recorded his first full-fledged pop album, Ringo, Keltner was featured on five tracks. Following this, Keltner joined George Harrison on his 1974 tour of the United States.\nIn 1974, Keltner played on the Lennon-produced Harry Nilsson album Pussy Cats alongside Ringo (and Keith Moon) on \"Rock Around the Clock\". Keltner was featured on the Nilsson albums Son of Schmilsson with Harrison, Starr and Beatles associate Klaus Voormann as well as Duit on Mon Dei with Starr and Voormann.\nKeltner's relationship with the former Beatles was such that, in 1973, his name was used to mock Paul McCartney on albums released by Harrison and Starr. Early that year, McCartney, the only Beatle not to have worked with Keltner, included a note on the back cover of his Red Rose Speedway album, encouraging fans to join the \"Wings Fun Club\" by sending a \"stamped addressed envelope\" to an address in London. Later that year, both Harrison's Living in the Material World and Starr's Ringo contained a similar note encouraging fans to join the \"Jim Keltner Fan Club\" by sending a \"stamped undressed elephant\" to an address in Hollywood. Keltner performed \nHerbert Butros Khaury (April 12, 1932 \u2013 November 30, 1996), also known as Herbert Buckingham Khaury, and known professionally as Tiny Tim, was an American musician and musical archivist. He is especially known for his 1968 hit recording of \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\", a cover of the popular song \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips with Me\" from the 1929 musical Gold Diggers of Broadway. Tiny Tim was renowned for his wide vocal range, in particular his far-reaching falsetto.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nTiny Tim was born Herbert Khaury in Manhattan, New York City, on April 12, 1932. His mother Tillie (n\u00e9e Staff), a Polish-Jewish garment worker, was the daughter of a rabbi. She had immigrated from Brest-Litovsk, present-day Belarus, as a teen in 1914. His father, Butros Khaury, was a textile worker from Beirut, present-day Lebanon, and the son of a  Maronite Catholic priest. Tiny Tim himself was a devout Catholic.\nKhaury displayed an interest in music at a very young age. At the age of five, his father gave him a vintage wind-up gramophone and a 78-RPM record of \"Beautiful Ohio\" by Henry Burr. Khaury has passionately praised Burr, telling Johnny Carson that \"the wonderful Henry Burr's\" circa-1915 records inspired his own singing style. He would sit for hours listening to the record. At the age of six, he began teaching himself guitar. By his pre-teen years, he developed a passion for records, specifically those from the 1900s through the 1930s. He began spending most of his free time at the New York Public Library, reading about the history of the phonograph industry and its first recording artists. He researched sheet music, often making photographic copies to take home to learn, a hobby he continued for his entire life. He grew up in the Washington Heights neighborhood in Manhattan, where he attended George Washington High School.\nIn 1945, while recovering from appendix removal, he read the Bible and listened to music on the radio. After his recovery, he rarely left his room except to go to school, where he was described as a mediocre student. He dropped out of high school after continuously repeating his sophomore year, taking a series of menial jobs. Around this time, he discovered he could sing in a high register while listening to Rudy Vall\u00e9e and taught himself to play ukulele using an Arthur Godfrey method book. He would later describe this period of his life as a \"religious experience\".\n\n\n=== The Singing Canary ===\nBy the early 1950s, Tiny Tim had landed a job as a messenger at the New York office of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, where he became ever more fascinated with the entertainment industry. He then entered a local talent show and sang \"You Are My Sunshine\" in his newly discovered falsetto. He started performing at dance club amateur nights under different names, such as \"Texarkana Tex\", \"Judas K. Foxglove\", \"Vernon Castle\", and \"Emmett Swink.\" To stand out as a performer, he wore wild clothing, grew his hair long and wore pasty white face makeup, partly inspired by Rudolph Valentino. His mother did not understand Herbert's change in appearance and was intending to take her now-twentysomething son to see a psychiatrist at Bellevue Hospital until his father stepped in. \n\nIn 1959, he performed as \"Larry Love, the Singing Canary\" at Hubert's Museum and Live Flea Circus in New York City's Times Square. While there, he signed with a manager who sent him on unpaid auditions throughout Greenwich Village. At this stage he began performing the song that would later become his signature, \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\". In 1963, he landed his first paid gig at Page 3, a lesbian-run club on the corner of Charles Street and Seventh Avenue, playing six hours a night and six nights a week for $96 per month. For the next two years, he performed as \"Dary Dover\" and later \"Sir Timothy Timms\". After a show in which he was booked to follow a \"midget\" act, his manager George King decided to bill him as \"Tiny Tim\" - a name which st\nThe American jazz singer Sammy Davis Jr. recorded extensively throughout his career and most recordings remain in the catalogs as various reissues.

When he was young, his family moved to Sacramento. He first started drumming in his early teens playing the drums for the band Phallucy in the early 90s. During this time, he also drummed for Deftones on the side, when the band was having problems landing a permanent and dedicated drummer. At the time when he started learning drums, he also learned how to play guitar, but growing up with a stepfather (Neil) who played the drums, he took a deeper passion with the drums. Abe's father, Sid, was also a musician and an early influence for Abe before his untimely passing. His influences include Stewart Copeland, Ginger Baker and Mitch Mitchell.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\nCunningham is known for his frantic, pounding rhythms on such songs as \"Knife Prty\" and clever usage of tempo (\"Mein\"), while at the same time refusing to indulge in the double bass drum setup of many metal traditionalists. However, he does use a double bass pedal as part of his kit, as seen in various drum magazines. A BBC reviewer has praised his style for displaying \"the assured expressiveness of a musician whose abilities stretch further than most metal-scene sticksmen\".\n\n\n== Other ventures ==\nCunningham has been a long time endorser of Tama Drums and Zildjian Cymbals, and for most of his career, has played the same setup. He has been featured in various ads for Tama and Zildjian. He is an endorser of Vater drumsticks, and at the 2017 NAMM Show revealed his new signature Vater drumsticks, the model is called \"Cool Breeze\" (which is Abe's nickname of sorts).\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nCunningham lives in Sacramento, California, with his family. He has two sons, Sidney and Daniel, with his ex-wife, Annalynn Seal. Annalynn made a guest appearance on \"MX\" singing along with Chino Moreno.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== With Deftones ===\nAdrenaline (1995, Maverick Records/Warner Bros.

A member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame since 2001 (his induction speech was given by longtime fan Keith Richards), Burton has also been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum. He was elected into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2024. Critic Mark Deming writes that \"Burton has a well-deserved reputation as one of the finest guitar pickers in either country or rock ... Burton is one of the best guitar players to ever touch a fretboard.\" He is ranked number 24 in Rolling Stone list of 250 greatest guitarists of all time.\nSince the 1950s, Burton has recorded and performed with an array of singers, including Bob Luman, Dale Hawkins, Ricky Nelson, Elvis Presley (and was leader of Presley's TCB Band), The Everly Brothers, Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, Glen Campbell, John Denver, Gram Parsons, Emmylou Harris, Judy Collins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Claude King, Elvis Costello, Joe Osborn, Roy Orbison, Joni Mitchell, Hoyt Axton, Townes Van Zandt, Steve Young, Vince Gill, and Suzi Quatro.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and career ===\nBurton was born in Dubberly in south Webster Parish near Minden, Louisiana, to Guy M. Burton (1909\u20132001) and the former Lola Poland (1914\u20132011), a native of rural Fryeburg in Bienville Parish. She was the daughter of James and Althius Poland. Burton's wife is Louise Burton.\nSelf-taught, Burton began playing guitar during childhood. He was hired to be part of the staff band for the popular Louisiana Hayride radio show in Shreveport. While he was still a teenager, Burton left Shreveport for Los Angeles, where he joined Ricky Nelson's band. There, he made numerous recordings as a session musician. Burton created and played the guitar solo on Dale Hawkins 1957 hit song \"Susie Q\", a record that would become one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.  He had originally written the song as an instrumental before Hawkins wrote lyrics for it; Burton never received credit or royalties for his contributions to \"Susie Q\".\n\n\n=== With Ricky Nelson, work as a session musician, and Shindig! ===\nBurton played guitar on the majority of Ricky Nelson's songs recorded during the first 11 years of Nelson's career, beginning with his premiere at Master Recorders in Hollywood on November 18, 1957, for the classic \"Stood Up\"/\"Waitin' in School\" rockabilly single.  At this time, Burton was relegated to rhythm as Joe Maphis was still playing lead guitar for Nelson.  Ricky Nelson's original (regular) band included Burton and double bassist James Kirkland; Kirkland was later replaced by Joe Osborn on electric bass.\nBurton's first single as Nelson's lead guitarist was \"Believe What You Say\".  In 1965 he started working on the television program Shindig! which curtailed his touring with Nelson. However, Burton continued contributing to his friend's studio albums through the Perspective sessions in April 1968.\nThe Shindig! exposure led to recording session work with a variety of artists, mostly as an unattributed sideman. In 1966, he began focusing more on his work as a session guitarist. \nIn 1967 Burton played Dobro on the Richie Furay song, \"A Child's Claim To Fame\" on Buffalo Springfield's second album, Buffalo Springfield Again. Due to the volume of work, Burton turned down an offer to join Bob Dylan's first touring band, and another offer to play on Elvis Presley's 1968 comeback TV special Elvis.\n\n\n=== With Elvis Presley ===\nIn 1969, Presley again asked Burton to join his show in Las Vegas, and, this time, Burton accepted. Burton organized the TCB Band, serving as its leader, and backed Presley from 1969 until Presley's death in 1977.  A hallmark of Elvis' live shows during this period was his exhortation, \"Play it, James\", as a cue for the guitarist's solos. For the first season in Vegas in 1969, Burton played his red standard Telecaster. Shortly the\nMichael Wayne Campbell (born February 1, 1950) is an American guitarist and vocalist. He was a member of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and co-wrote many of the band's hits with Petty, including \"Refugee\", \"Here Comes My Girl\", \"You Got Lucky\", and \"Runnin' Down a Dream\".  Outside of The Heartbreakers, he has worked as a session guitarist and songwriter with a number of other acts, including composing and playing on the Don Henley hits \"The Boys of Summer\" & \"The Heart of the Matter\" as well as working on most of Stevie Nicks's solo albums. Campbell, along with Neil Finn, joined Fleetwood Mac to replace lead guitarist Lindsey Buckingham on their world tour in 2018\u20132019.  After the end of that tour, he has been involved in his own band, the Dirty Knobs. As of 2024, the Dirty Knobs have released three albums.\nOn November 11, 2011, Rolling Stone magazine named Campbell in their list of the top 100 guitarists, coming in at number 79. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002 as a member of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nCampbell was born on February 1, 1950, in Panama City, Florida. He grew up there and in Jacksonville, Florida, where he graduated from Jean Ribault High School in 1968. At the age of 16, his mother, Helen Barber, bought him his first guitar, a Harmony acoustic model which he later described as \"unplayable\" from a pawnshop. His first electric guitar was a $60 Guyatone, but playing a friend's Gibson SG (a model which Campbell would not own himself for many years) was a transformative experience. Like Tom Petty, Campbell drew his strongest influences from The Byrds and Bob Dylan, with additional inspiration coming from guitarists such as Scotty Moore, Luther Perkins, George Harrison, Carl Wilson, Jerry Garcia, Roger McGuinn, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Jimmy Page, Mick Taylor, and Neil Young. The first song he learned to play was \"Baby Let Me Follow You Down,\" a song which appeared on Dylan's eponymous debut album. He formed a band named Dead or Alive which quickly disbanded.\nCampbell met Tom Petty through drummer Randall Marsh. Marsh was auditioning to be in Petty's band Mudcrutch and learned that Mudcrutch had recently lost their guitarist. He suggested that Petty try Campbell, who was his roommate and had actually been listening to the conversation in the next room. Campbell impressed Petty with his version of \"Johnny B. Goode\" and was offered a spot in the band. Mudcrutch became a popular act around Gainesville and north Florida in the early 1970s. They relocated to Los Angeles in 1974 and signed a record deal with Shelter Records, but released only one poor-selling single and broke up soon after.\n\n\n== Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers ==\n\nIn 1976, Campbell rejoined Petty to begin Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers with former Mudcrutch member Benmont Tench (keyboards) along with Ron Blair (bass guitar) and Stan Lynch (drums).\nLike the other Heartbreakers, Campbell avoids the virtuoso approach to playing, preferring to have his work serve the needs of each song.\nCampbell co-produced the Heartbreakers albums Southern Accents, Pack Up the Plantation: Live!, Let Me Up (I've Had Enough), Into the Great Wide Open, Songs and Music from \"She's the One\", Echo, The Last DJ, The Live Anthology and Mojo, as well as the Petty solo albums Full Moon Fever, Wildflowers, and Highway Companion. His sole vocal contribution to the group was on the track \"I Don't Wanna Fight\" on Echo.\nCampbell collaborated, recorded, and toured with Tom Petty for almost 50 years. His last live performance with the Heartbreakers was on September 25, 2017, at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. Tom Petty died unexpectedly about one week later, on October 2.\n\n\n== Side projects ==\nIn 1997, Campbell co-founded the Blue Stingrays with Heartbreakers member Ron Blair and Mudcrutch member Randall Marsh, and released their one album the same year.\nIn 2007, he joined a reformed Mudcrutch with Petty, Tench, Marsh, and Tom Leadon\nOld Dan's Records is Canadian singer Gordon Lightfoot's eighth studio album, released in 1972 on the Reprise Records label. The album reached #1 in Canada on the RPM national album chart on November 5, 1972, and remained there for three weeks. In the U.S., it peaked at #95 on the pop chart.\nThe album marks a continued evolution in Lightfoot's sound as he begins to add country influences to his standard folk sound with the help of the banjo, dobro and steel guitar. Lightfoot would continue to use these country influences in his music until the early 1980s.\nDespite its 1972 year of initial release, the album was nominated for and won the 1974 Juno Award for \"Folk Album of the Year\".  Lightfoot also won a Juno that year as \"Folk Singer of the Year\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll compositions by Gordon Lightfoot\n\n\n=== Side 1 ===\n\"Farewell to Annabel\" \u2013 2:59\n\"That Same Old Obsession\" \u2013 3:46\n\"Old Dan's Records\" \u2013 3:05\n\"Lazy Mornin'\" \u2013 3:43\n\"You Are What I Am\" \u2013 2:37\n\n\n=== Side 2 ===\n\"Can't Depend on Love\" \u2013 3:12\n\"My Pony Won't Go\" \u2013 3:50\n\"It's Worth Believin'\" \u2013 3:24\n\"Mother of a Miner's Child\" \u2013 3:18\n\"Hi'way Songs\" \u2013 3:37\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nGordon Lightfoot - vocals, guitar, vibraphone\nRed Shea - lead guitar, classical guitar, Dobro\nTerry Clements - lead guitar\nRick Haynes - bass\nBarry Keane - drums, percussion\nDave Brown - percussion\nBruce Good - autoharp\nLarry Good - 5-string banjo\nDavid Bromberg - slide Dobro (\"My Pony Won't Go\")\nNick De Caro - piano, orchestral arrangements\nOllie Strong - steel guitar\nTechnical\nLee Herschberg - engineer\nEd Thrasher - art direction\nJohn Reeves - photography\n\"Special thanks to Bill Richards and Guido Basso and members of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlbum lyrics and chords\nWarner Music Group Corp., commonly abbreviated as WMG, is an American multinational entertainment and record label conglomerate headquartered in New York City. It is one of the \"big three\" recording companies and the third-largest in the global music industry, after Universal Music Group (UMG) and Sony Music Entertainment (SME). Formerly part of Time Warner (later known as WarnerMedia, now Warner Bros. Discovery), WMG was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange from 2005 until 2011, when it announced its privatization and sale to Access Industries. It later had its second IPO on Nasdaq in 2020, once again becoming a public company. With a multibillion-dollar annual turnover, WMG employs more than 4,500 people and has operations in more than 50 countries throughout the world.\nThe company owns and operates some of the largest and most successful labels in the world, including Elektra Records, Reprise Records, Warner Records, Parlophone Records (previously owned by EMI), and Atlantic Records. WMG also owns Warner Chappell Music, one of the world's largest music publishers.\nSince August 2, 2018, WMG has expanded its business to digital media operations through its acquisition of Uproxx.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1950s and 1960s ===\nThe film studio Warner Bros. had no record label division at the time one of its contracted actors, Tab Hunter, scored a No. 1 hit song in 1957 for Dot Records, a division of rival Paramount Pictures. In order to prevent any repetition of its actors recording for rival companies, and to also capitalize on the music business, Warner Bros. Records was created in 1958; its original office was located above the film studio's machine shop on 3701 Warner Boulevard in Burbank, California. In 1963, Warner purchased Reprise Records, which had been founded by Frank Sinatra three years earlier so that he could have more creative control over his recordings. With the Reprise acquisition, Warner gained the services of Mo Ostin, who was mainly responsible for the success of Warner/Reprise.\nAfter Warner Bros. was sold to Seven Arts Productions in 1967 (forming Warner Bros.-Seven Arts), it purchased Atlantic Records, founded in 1947 and WMG's oldest label (until WMG completed its acquisition of Parlophone in 2013), as well as its subsidiary Atco Records. This acquisition brought Neil Young into the company fold, initially as a member of Buffalo Springfield. Young became one of Warner's longest-established artists, recording both as a solo artist and with groups under the Warner-owned Atlantic, Atco, and Reprise labels. Young also recorded five albums for Geffen Records during that label's period of Warner distribution. The Geffen catalogue, now owned by Universal Music Group, represents Young's only major recordings not under WMG ownership.\nAtlantic, its subsidiary Atco Records, and its affiliate Stax Records paved the way for Warner's rise to industry prominence. The purchase brought in Atlantic's lucrative back catalogue, which included classic recordings by Ray Charles, the Drifters, the Coasters, and many more. In the mid-1960s, Atlantic/Stax released a string of landmark soul music recordings by artists including Booker T & the MGs, Sam & Dave, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, Ben E. King, and Aretha Franklin. Ultimately, the sale led to Stax leaving Atlantic because Seven Arts Productions insisted on keeping the rights to Stax recordings. Atlantic moved decisively into rock and pop in the late 1960s and 1970s, signing major British and American acts including Led Zeppelin, Cream, Crosby Stills & Nash, Yes, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Genesis, Average White Band, Dr. John, King Crimson, Bette Midler, Roxy Music, and Foreigner.\nIn 1969, two years after being purchased by Seven Arts, the Warner Bros.-Seven Arts company was sold to the Kinney National Company. In mid-1972, Kinney Music of Canada, Ltd. was renamed WEA Music of Canada, Ltd. (French: WEA Musique du Canada, Lt\u00e9e) as the Canadian branch of the WEA (Warner, El\nJune Elizabeth Millington (born April 14, 1948) is a Filipina-American guitarist, songwriter, producer, educator, and actress. \nMillington was the founder of the music groups the Svelts and Wild Honey, before becoming co-founder and lead guitarist of the all-female rock band Fanny, which was active from 1970 to 1974. Millington has been called \"a godmother of women's music\", and is the co-founder and artistic director of the Institute for the Musical Arts (IMA) in Goshen, Massachusetts.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJune Elizabeth Millington was born in Manila, the Philippines, on April 14, 1948, the eldest of the seven children of Filipina socialite \"Yola\" Yolanda Leonor Limjoco Millington (born February 10, 1922, in Lian, Batangas, the Philippines; died December 19, 2002, in California, U.S.), and former United States Navy Lt. Commander John \"Jack\" Howard Millington (born September 18, 1915, in Burlington, Vermont; died June 24, 1980, in Bristol, Vermont). He had graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1939, and was a son of Professor Howard G. Millington, a noted folklorist. June Millington's parents were married in Manila in May 1947, and divorced in California in March 1970. Millington is the older sister of bassist Jean Y. Millington Adamian (born May 25, 1949, in Manila), Richard J. Millington, Stephen H. Millington, James E. Millington, David S. Millington, and Sylvia F. G. Millington Lyons.\n\n\n=== Philippines ===\nJack and Yola Millington and their children lived luxuriously  with Yola's parents Angel Limjoco and Felisa Limjoco (n\u00e9e Lejano) in various Manila locations until they moved to the United States in 1961, including at 56 R. Pascual Street, San Juan (then part of Rizal province); in the Wack Wack Golf and Country Club in Mandaluyong; near the old American School in Pasay; and on N. Domingo Street, San Juan; and for several months just before they emigrated at the Howell Compound in Quezon City. Additionally, during 1953, Millington and her family lived for a year in Baguio with her grandparents.\nAt the age of eight, Millington began playing piano to entertain her family, and later listened to music on the radio and attempted to play along on ukulele. Her family encouraged her to sing and play ukulele at gatherings.\nMillington and her siblings attended The American School, then located in Donada Street in Pasay in Manila, where she later recalled: \"the racism we encountered at the American School was crushing.\" By 1960 Millington transferred to the Assumption Convent school located in Makati, Metro Manila. Early in 1961, when Millington was in the seventh grade, she heard a girl play the guitar, which jump-started her interest in the instrument.\nOn her 13th birthday, Millington was given a small, hand-made, mother-of-pearl inlaid guitar by her mother.\n\n\n=== United States ===\nThree weeks later, in May 1961, the Millington family left the Philippines for the United States on the SS President Cleveland. While on board ship, Millington switched from playing the ukulele to acoustic guitar. On June 22, 1961, the Millington family arrived in the U.S., and then settled in Sacramento, California.\nMillington recalled: \"We always felt like \"other\", never quite fitting in, both in Manila and Sacramento. Being both biracial and bicultural was a really really tough slot in the '50s into the '60s, our formative teenage years.\" In an attempt to become more popular and make friends, in 1962, Millington and her sister Jean wrote their first song \"Angel in White\", followed by \"Miss Wallflower '62\", which they sang with two other girls on their ukuleles at their junior high school variety show. Millington recalled that afterwards, \"Kids started coming up to us and telling us they liked it. So it dawned on us this was a way to make friends.\" In 1962, Millington and her sister Jean began to sing folk songs together as an acoustic duo at hootenannies and similar events, including the songs of Peter, Paul and Mary and other artists featu\nFrancis Albert Sinatra (; December 12, 1915 \u2013 May 14, 1998) was an American singer and actor. Nicknamed the \"Chairman of the Board\" and later called \"Ol' Blue Eyes,\" he is regarded as one of the most popular entertainers of the mid-20th century. Sinatra is among the world's best-selling music artists, with an estimated 150 million record sales globally.\nBorn to Italian immigrants in Hoboken, New Jersey, Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era and was greatly influenced by the easy-listening vocal style of Bing Crosby. He found success as a solo artist after signing with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the \"bobby soxers\". In 1946, Sinatra released his debut album, The Voice of Frank Sinatra. He then signed with Capitol Records and released several albums with  arrangements by Nelson Riddle, notably In the Wee Small Hours (1955) and Songs for Swingin' Lovers! (1956). In 1960, Sinatra left Capitol Records to start his own record label, Reprise Records, releasing a string of successful albums. He collaborated with Count Basie on Sinatra-Basie: An Historic Musical First (1962) and It Might as Well Be Swing (1964). In 1965, he recorded the retrospective album September of My Years and starred in the Emmy-winning television special Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music. After releasing Sinatra at the Sands in early 1966, Sinatra recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Tom Jobim, Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim. It was followed by 1968's Francis A. & Edward K. with Duke Ellington. Sinatra retired in 1971 following the release of \"My Way\" but came out of retirement two years later. He recorded several albums and released \"New York, New York\" in 1980.\nSinatra also forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for From Here to Eternity (1953), he starred in The Man with the Golden Arm (1955) and The Manchurian Candidate (1962). Sinatra also appeared in musicals such as On the Town (1949), Guys and Dolls (1955), High Society (1956), and Pal Joey (1957), which won him a Golden Globe Award. Toward the end of his career, he frequently played detectives, including the title character in Tony Rome (1967). Sinatra received the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1971. On television, The Frank Sinatra Show began on CBS in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s.\nIn 1983, Sinatra was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1985 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. Sinatra received eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award, and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He was included in Time magazine's compilation of the 20th century's 100 most influential people. American music critic Robert Christgau called him \"the greatest singer of the 20th century\" and he continues to be regarded as an iconic figure.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nFrancis Albert Sinatra was born on December 12, 1915, in a tenement at 415 Monroe Street in Hoboken, New Jersey, the only child of Italian immigrants Natalina \"Dolly\" Garaventa and Antonino Martino \"Marty\" Sinatra, who boxed under the name Marty O'Brien. Sinatra weighed 13.5 pounds (6.1 kg) at birth and had to be delivered with the aid of forceps, which caused severe scarring to his left cheek, neck, and ear, and perforated his eardrum\u2014which remained damaged for the rest of his life. His grandmother resuscitated him by running her grandson under cold water until he gasped his first breath. Due to his injuries, his baptism at St. Francis Church in Hoboken was delayed until April 2, 1916. A childhood operation on his mastoid bone left major scarring on his neck, and during adolescence he was further scarred by cystic acne. Sinatra was raised in the Catholic Church.\nSinatra's mother was energetic and driven; biographers believe that she was the dominant factor in the development of\nDwight David Yoakam (born October 23, 1956) is an American country singer-songwriter, actor, and filmmaker. He first achieved mainstream attention in 1986 with the release of his debut album Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.. Yoakam had considerable success throughout the late 1980s onward, with a total of ten studio albums for Reprise Records. Later projects have been released on Audium (now MNRK Music Group), New West, Warner, and Sugar Hill Records.\nHis first three albums\u2014Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc., Hillbilly Deluxe, and Buenas Noches from a Lonely Room\u2014all reached number one on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. Yoakam also has two number-one singles on Hot Country Songs with \"Streets of Bakersfield\" (a duet with Buck Owens) and \"I Sang Dixie\", and twelve additional top-ten hits. He has won two Grammy Awards and one Academy of Country Music award. 1993's This Time is his most commercially successful album, having been certified triple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\nYoakam's musical style draws from a wide variety of influences including alternative country, neotraditional country, honky-tonk, rock, and the Bakersfield sound. He is known for his distinctive tenor singing voice, unconventional musical image, and the lead guitar work of his longtime producer and bandleader Pete Anderson. Yoakam writes most of his own songs but has recorded many successful cover songs by a wide range of artists including Johnny Horton, Elvis Presley, Cheap Trick, The Blasters, Lefty Frizzell, and Queen. He has collaborated with Beck, John Mellencamp, k.d. lang, Ralph Stanley, and members of Alison Krauss & Union Station.\nAs an actor, Yoakam has appeared in the movies Red Rock West, Sling Blade, Panic Room, The Minus Man, and Wedding Crashers, as well as South of Heaven, West of Hell, which he wrote and directed. He also appeared in the TV series P.S. I Luv U and Under the Dome, as well as the Amazon Prime Video original series Goliath.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nDwight David Yoakam was born October 23, 1956, in Pikeville, Kentucky. He is the eldest of three children to Ruth (n\u00e9e Tibbs) and David Yoakam. At the time of Yoakam's birth, his father was serving in the United States Army. After David Yoakam was discharged from the Army, the Yoakams moved to Columbus, Ohio. By this point the couple had a second son named Ronald and a daughter named Kimberly. Meanwhile, David supported his family by working at a Westinghouse Electric Corporation factory and later by ownership of a Texaco gas station. Yoakam's father had acquired a guitar manufactured by the Kay Musical Instrument Company while in the Army, and gave it to Yoakam after being unable to learn to play it himself. Although Yoakam later broke this guitar, he received another one as a Christmas present while he was in the fourth grade. He also wrote his first song around this point. As a child, Yoakam took influence from the music that his parents listened to on records as well as WMNI, then an AM country music radio station in Columbus. Among these records were compilations by Johnny Cash and Johnny Horton. According to his mother, the family would also sing songs to each other when on road trips to visit Yoakam's maternal grandparents. Yoakam himself also stated that he was influenced by rock and roll acts he had seen on television, such as Elvis Presley.\nThe Yoakam family moved to another neighborhood of Columbus in 1968, where Yoakam attended Northland High School. His mother encouraged all three of her children to join the school's band, in which Yoakam played drums. He also attended drama class at Northland High School, which led to him playing the role of Charlie in a production of Flowers for Algernon. Yoakam later attributed this performance as giving him more confidence performing in front of others. In his senior year of high school, Yoakam and some classmates formed a rock and roll band to compete in the school's talent show. The band became popula\nMichael Steven Bubl\u00e9  (IPA:  boo-BLAY; born September 9, 1975) is a Canadian singer and songwriter. Born in Burnaby, British Columbia, he is often credited for helping to renew public interest and appreciation for traditional pop standards and the Great American Songbook. Bubl\u00e9 has sold over 75 million records worldwide, and won numerous awards, including five Grammy Awards and fifteen Juno Awards.\nIn 2003, Bubl\u00e9's first album reached the top ten in Canada and the United Kingdom. He found a worldwide audience with his 2005 album It's Time and his 2007 album Call Me Irresponsible \u2013 which reached number one on the Canadian Albums Chart, the UK Albums Chart, the US Billboard 200, the Australian ARIA Albums Chart and several European charts. His 2009 album Crazy Love debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 after three days of sales, and remained there for two weeks. It was also his fourth number-one album on Billboard's Top Jazz Albums chart. His 2011 holiday album, Christmas, was in first place on the Billboard 200 for the final four weeks of 2011 and the first week of 2012, totalling five weeks atop the chart, it also made the top 5 in the United Kingdom. With this, Christmas became his third-consecutive number-one album on the chart. To Be Loved was released in April 2013, followed by Nobody but Me in October 2016 and Love in November 2018.\n\n\n== Early life and musical beginnings ==\nMichael Steven Bubl\u00e9 was born in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada, on September 9, 1975, the son of Lewis Bubl\u00e9, a fisherman, and Amber (n\u00e9e Santaga), a homemaker. Bubl\u00e9's paternal and maternal great-grandparents immigrated to Canada from Italy. His surname was originally spelled \"Bubli\", and some of his paternal ancestors came from Istria. Bubl\u00e9 stated: \"[On the side of the family native to modern-day Croatia] some say we're Yugoslavian, others that we're Italian.\" He has two younger sisters, Brandee, a children's book author, and Crystal, an actress. He and his siblings were raised Roman Catholic. He attended Seaforth Elementary School and Cariboo Hill Secondary School.\nAccording to an Oprah Winfrey interview on October 10, 2009, Bubl\u00e9 dreamed of becoming a famous singer since he was two. When he was a teenager, he slept with his Bible and prayed to become a singer. His interest in jazz began at around age five when his family played Bing Crosby's White Christmas album. His musical influences include Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Tony Bennett, Elvis Presley, Bobby Darin and Sam Cooke.\nThe first time his family noticed his singing talent was during the Christmas holidays, when Bubl\u00e9 was 13 years old, and they heard him powerfully sing the phrase \"May your days be merry and bright\" when the family was singing to the song \"White Christmas\" on a car ride.\nBubl\u00e9 also has a strong passion for ice hockey and wanted to become a professional hockey player for the Vancouver Canucks growing up, but believed he was not good enough. \"I wanted so bad to be a hockey player... If I was any good at hockey, I probably wouldn't be singing right now.\" He often played hockey in his youth, watched Vancouver Canucks games with his father, and said that he \"went to every single home game as a kid... I remember I wanted to be Gary Lupul, I wanted to be Patrik Sundstrom and Ivan Hlinka. I used to think that being named Michael Bubl\u00e9 was pretty cool because I was close to being called Jiri Bubla.\" Bubl\u00e9 shared his hockey interest with his grandfather.\nFrom the age of 14, Bubl\u00e9 spent six years working during the summer as a commercial fisherman with his father and crewmates. He called the experience \"the most deadly physical work I'll ever know in my lifetime. We'd be gone for two, sometimes three months at a time and the experience of living and working among guys over twice my age taught me a lot about responsibility and what it means to be a man.\"\nHis first singing engagements were in nightclubs at age 16 and were facilitated by his Italian grandfather Demetrio Santag\nReprise Please Baby: The Warner Bros. Years is a 2002 box set of songs by American country musician Dwight Yoakam, highlighting his career on Reprise Records and Warner Bros. Records, along with his initial 1981 demos and two new tracks. It has received positive reviews from critics.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nWriting for The A. V. Club, Stephen Thompson stated that this compilation \"has more than settled any arguments about Yoakam's rightful place in modern country's canon\" by including material from his \"fine\" 1980s releases as well as the musician's \"immensely satisfying but lesser-known '90s catalog\". Editors at AllMusic rated this album 5 out of 5 stars, with critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing that \"on Rhino's excellent four-disc box set\" Yoakam's influence on country music is display with \"a superb chronicling of his time at Reprise/Warner Records\" that \"doesn't focus simply on the hits\", adding up to music that is \"all necessary to understanding Yoakam's music and his influence\". Jim Caligiuri of The Austin Chronicle also rated this box set 5 out of 5 stars, characterizing it as \"a testament to a talent unmatched in many ways\" and \"a marvelous first chapter in a career that shows no signs of slowing down\". In a brief overview of box sets released at the end of 2002, Neil Strauss stated that the best part of Reprise Please Baby: The Warner Bros. Years was the fourth disc of previously unreleased studio and live material and continued that \"in this set, one can hear [Yoakam']s stubborn traditionalism and his innate eclecticism intertwine as two decades roll by\". No Depression's review stated that \"so many good points jump out of the speakers here\", displaying that \"Yoakam is equally at home with all forms of country from the second half of the 20th century\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll songs written by Dwight Yoakam, except where noted.\nDisc 1\n\n\"Honky Tonk Man\" (Tillman Franks, Howard Hausey, and Johnny Horton) \u2013 2:48\n\"Guitars, Cadillacs\" \u2013 3:05\n\"It Won\u2019t Hurt\" \u2013 3:05\n\"Miner\u2019s Prayer\" \u2013 2:19\n\"Little Sister\" (Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman) \u2013 3:03\n\"Little Ways\" \u2013 3:21\n\"Please, Please Baby\" \u2013 3:35\n\"Always Late with Your Kisses\" (Blackie Crawford and Lefty Frizzell) \u2013 2:11\n\"This Drinkin\u2019 Will Kill Me\" \u2013 2:34\n\"Streets of Bakersfield\" (Homer Joy) \u2013 2:50\n\"I Sang Dixie\" \u2013 3:49\n\"I Got You\" \u2013 3:29\n\"I Hear You Knockin\u2019\" (Dave Bartholomew, Pearl King, and J.

Payne (born March 12, 1949, in Waco, Texas) is an American pianist who, with Lowell George, co-founded the American rock band Little Feat. He is considered by many other rock pianists, including Elton John, to be one of the finest American piano rock and blues musicians. In addition to his trademark barrelhouse blues piano, he is noted for his work on the Hammond B3 organ. Payne is an accomplished songwriter whose credits include \"Oh, Atlanta\". Following the death of Little Feat drummer Richie Hayward on August 12, 2010, Payne is the only member of the group from the original four-piece line-up currently playing in the band.\nPayne has worked and recorded with J. J. Cale, Jimmy Buffett, Doobie Brothers, Emmylou Harris, Bryan Adams, Pink Floyd, Bob Seger, Toto, Linda Ronstadt, Jackson Browne, Carly Simon, James Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, Helen Watson, Stevie Nicks, Robert Palmer, Richard Torrance, Stephen Bruton, and Shocking Edison. He was a guest performer on Bonnie Raitt's album Sweet Forgiveness in 1977, and wrote its track, \"Takin' My Time.\"\nPaul Barrere and Bill Payne played several live concerts with Phil Lesh and Friends, from October 1999 through July 2000.  Payne was a member of Boulder band Leftover Salmon from 2014 until December 2015.\nIn August 2015, Payne was selected to play keyboards for The Doobie Brothers after their keyboardist Guy Allison was called to work on an album project in Japan. However, in December 2015 Payne rejoined the Doobies as a touring member, officially taking the position previously held by Allison.  In the few weeks of touring with the Doobies, he was featured with the band and Michael McDonald on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.  Payne's temporary term ended in early September after the Doobies' concert at the BB&T Pavilion in Camden, New Jersey.\n\n\n== Other work ==\nPayne was a pioneer in the development of online music communities. In the early 1990s, he contacted his fan base and enlisted the help of friend Jay Herbst to develop the Little Feat Grass-roots Movement. This model went on to be a template for many bands in the creation of their Street Teams, which enlist the help of fans for purposes of music and concert promotion. This method has proven to be an effective vehicle for bringing bands and fans closer together, and forging friendships between them.\nPayne now also works as a commercial photographer.\n\n\n== Songwriting (selected) ==\nPayne wrote or co-wrote many of the songs in Little Feat's catalogue, including the following:\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Little Feat ===\n\n\n=== Solo ===\nCielo Norte (2005)\n\n\n== Collaborations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBill Payne Discography\nLittle Feat website\nSomething Wild (1966)\nCertain Fury O.S.T.

Records before signing to major label Reprise Records. Dookie, the band's first album on the label and third studio album overall, was released in February 1994. It was a breakout success, selling over 10 million copies in the United States and 20 million copies worldwide. Dookie spawned five singles, including the international hits \"Longview\", \"Basket Case\" and \"When I Come Around\". The album placed Green Day at the forefront of the 1990s punk rock revival.\nInsomniac, the band's fourth studio album, was released in October 1995. While not as successful as Dookie, the album managed to peak at number two on the US Billboard 200 and received a double platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
