The school serves as a Visual and Performing Arts Magnet and Center for International Studies magnet for Orange County Public Schools.\nThe school's first principal, Bill Spoone, went on to be elected to the Orange County School Board. The football stadium is named after him. The school's gymnasium is named after its second principal, Larry Payne, and is nicknamed \"The House of Payne.\"\nThe school opened with enrollment above capacity and began using portable classrooms on the North Campus, formerly known as the 9th Grade Center. Due to overflow from main campus, many non-freshman classes were moved into additional portable classrooms at the 9th Grade Center, which was renamed North Campus, with the main campus renamed the South Campus. Portable classrooms are still used on the North Campus and are primarily for freshman-level classes.\nAs of the 2014\u201315 school year the school had 3,641 students, of whom 35% were white, 32% African American, 24% Hispanic, 7% Asian, and 2% multiracial.\nThe school underwent a series of renovations which finished in 2015.

A full-time employee of a large aerospace contractor and not formally employed by the school, Murray was elected to their Athletic Hall of Fame in 2001.\nThe school's baseball facility is John Barbati Field. In 1992, the baseball facilities were completely renovated with a state of the art press box, team office and facilities. The new facilities were designed and constructed by William P. Riegert, CEO of Cox Associates, Architects, and donated to the OC School Board in a dedication ceremony on February 22, 1992. Accepting for the OC School Board were Assistant Superintendent Dave Wofford, Assistant Superintendent Dave Sojourner, Superintendent Don Shaw, Bill Spoone, and Bill Thompson.

He became a prominent figure in citrus farming in Central Florida and remains known in Orlando for his philanthropy.  \n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPhilip Phillips was born in Memphis, Tennessee to Henri and Isabelle Phillippe, both originally from France. Henri had come to the United States while serving in the merchant navy under Napoleon III. He spent most of his childhood in Lebanon, Tennessee.\nPhillips earned a medical degree from Columbia University in New York, for which he earned the life-long nickname \"Doc\". He first moved to Florida in 1894 with a $5,000 endowment from his father and bought a grove in Satsuma, but returned to Tennessee when the plants died off during the Great Freeze that same winter. In 1897, Phillips acquired land in Osceola County, which he used as orchards and grazing fields for cattle. In 1901, he married Della Wolf, with whom he had two sons, Howard and Walter. Phillips moved his family to a grove he purchased by Sand Lake near Orlando. Over the years, Phillips built housing and a post office for his guest workers, most from the Bahamas, developing the property into what would later become Dr. Phillips, Florida. In the 1950s, he established a town clinic for black citizens, who were otherwise restricted in accessing medical services in Florida.\nHe died in Hot Springs, Arkansas and is buried in Doctor Phillips Cemetery.\n\n\n== Career ==\nPhillips initially sold his harvest as produce before he began manufacturing fruit juice at a self-operated plant in 1928.  A citrus magnate, he owned more than 5,000 acres (20 km2) of citrus groves across nine Floridian counties in 1920 before selling his industry assets to Granada Groves and Minute Maid in 1954 in a 75%/25% split. In 1953, he established the Dr. P. Phillips Foundation, while Dr. Phillips Inc. remained in the real estate business, particularly as run by his son Howard.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nMany places and establishments are named in his honor in the Orlando, Florida area, including the community of Dr. Phillips, Florida (a suburb of Orlando), Dr. P.

You just have to assume that they're a reasonable age. I don't think we found out what his age was until we were deep in the season and then we were like, 'Oh, OK.' I assumed he was, like, 20. And the other thing I will say, when you see an actual 15-year-old boy, they're just not going to be a heartthrob.

It is mostly known for being the mailing address for Walt Disney World, although almost all of the resort facilities, including all four theme parks, are physically located in the adjacent city of Bay Lake. It is one of two Florida municipalities inside the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, which also contains Walt Disney World, the other being Bay Lake. The permanent residential population of Lake Buena Vista was 24 at the 2020 census.\nThe city is part of the Orlando\u2013Kissimmee\u2013Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area, more commonly known as Greater Orlando or the Orlando metropolitan area.\n\n\n== History ==\nChapter 67-1965 of the Laws of Florida, incorporating the City of Reedy Creek, was signed into law by Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. on May 12, 1967, the same day he also signed chapters 67-764 (creating the Reedy Creek Improvement District), also known as the Reedy Creek Improvement Act, and 67-1104 (incorporating the city of Bay Lake). It was located fully inside the Reedy Creek Improvement District. The city was controlled by Walt Disney Productions and allowed it powers that other area attractions had not had.\n\nChapter 69-1527, which became law on July 3, 1969, without the governor's approval, redefined the city boundaries. The city was completely moved, taking over some land that had been part of the City of Bay Lake (and was given up by Chapter 69-836, which became a law the same day) and including some other land that had formerly been unincorporated. Soon after, the City of Reedy Creek was renamed to the City of Lake Buena Vista to better reflect its new location, through which Reedy Creek did not flow. \"Buena Vista\" comes from the name of the street in Burbank, California, where The Walt Disney Company is headquartered.\nThe Reedy Creek Improvement District had all the powers of the city and more, raising the question of why cities needed to be incorporated inside it. Walt Disney's original plans for the site included at least one futuristic living area, a planned \"community of the future\". This was never built, but some of the ideas were incorporated into the EPCOT theme park and later Celebration, Florida. The only residents of the city are Disney employees and their immediate family members who live in a small community on Royal Oak Court, north of Disney Springs. From 1971 to 2022, the only landowners are fully owned subsidiaries of Disney, and rights-of-way for state and county roads.\nOn February 27, 2023, the Florida Legislature passed House Bill 9B to supersede the Reedy Creek Improvement Act, replacing the Reedy Creek Improvement District with the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe approximate coordinates for the City of Lake Buena Vista is located at 28\u00b022\u203239\u2033N 81\u00b031\u203218\u2033W (28.377362, \u201381.521728).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 3.1 square miles (8.0 km2), of which 3.0 square miles (7.7 km2) is land and 0.12 square miles (0.3 km2) (4.02%) is water.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nThe climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild winters.

The lake, which was called \"Blake Lake\" before its acquisition by Disney, was named for Buena Vista Street in Burbank, California, where Disney's corporate headquarters are located. Several Walt Disney Company business entities had names containing \"Buena Vista\", a Spanish phrase that means \"good view\".\nIn 2015, guide maps for the Disney Springs shopping, dining, and entertainment district started promoting Village Lake, which the district and Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa borders, as \"Lake Buena Vista\".
