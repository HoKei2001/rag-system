He named the album after his eldest child, Asahd Tuck Khaled. In March 2019, he announced the release date, while in the meantime, promoting the album extensively on his social media accounts. He also posted a trailer for the album. DJ Khaled has also teased numerous collaborations on his social media, which, along with Future, Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 on \"Top Off\", and Justin Bieber, Chance the Rapper and Quavo on \"No Brainer\", include J Balvin, Cardi B, Meek Mill, Post Malone, Travis Scott, Chief Keef, Bryson Tiller, Sizzla, and 2 Chainz. In April 2019, TMZ reported that \"Higher\" featuring Nipsey Hussle and John Legend would appear on the album. DJ Khaled, Nipsey Hussle, and John Legend shot the music video before Nipsey's death on March 31, 2019.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nFather of Asahd received mixed reviews among critics.

Father of Asahd debuted behind American rapper and record producer Tyler, the Creator's fifth studio album, Igor.\nOn June 6, DJ Khaled posted a now-deleted video on his Instagram page that many believe was aimed at Tyler, the Creator after his album beat out Father of Asahd for the number one spot on the Billboard charts. In the video, Khaled stated, \"Here's the thing, I make albums so people can play it. And you actually hear it. You know, driving your car you hear another car playing it. Go to the barber shop, you hear them playing it. You know, turn the radio on, and you hear them playing it. It's playing everywhere - it's called great music. It's called albums that you actually hear the songs. Not no mysterious shit, and you never hear it.\" Many people took the \"mysterious shit\" line to be about Tyler, who responded on Twitter when a follower told him, \"Wow doin pretty good for some mysterious shit.\" Tyler told the follower, \"yeah i am, IGOR OUT NOW.\"\n\n\n== Track l\nKhaled Mohammed Khaled (; born November 26, 1975), known professionally as DJ Khaled, is an American DJ, record producer, and record executive. Originally a Miami-based radio personality, Khaled has since become known for enlisting high-profile music industry artists to perform on singles and albums, for which he often serves as hype man. His distinctions are his booming voice presence, \"motivational\" abstractions, and numerous catchphrases. While his musical contribution is often questioned, Khaled's role has been described as \"organization, direction, [and] promotion\".\nKhaled was born in New Orleans to Palestinian immigrant parents. He first gained recognition as a radio host in the 1990s for the radio station 99 Jamz, and translated his popularity by working with Fat Joe's hip hop collective, Terror Squad, as a DJ for their live performances. Following his production credits on the group's material, Khaled enlisted several hip hop artists associated with the group and his native Miami to perform on his debut studio album, Listennn... the Album (2006). His second album, We the Best (2007), spawned the hit single \"I'm So Hood\" (featuring T-Pain, Trick Daddy, Rick Ross and Plies). His two subsequent releases\u2014We Global (2008) and Victory (2010)\u2014both peaked within the top ten of the Billboard 200; the latter was supported by the single \"All I Do Is Win\" (featuring T-Pain, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg and Rick Ross), which received triple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\nHis fifth studio album and major label debut, We the Best Forever (2011), saw continued commercial success and brought Khaled to mainstream prominence by spawning his first Billboard Hot 100-top ten single, \"I'm on One\" (featuring Drake, Rick Ross and Lil Wayne). His following three albums\u2014Kiss the Ring (2012), Suffering from Success (2013), and I Changed a Lot (2015)\u2014were released to moderate critical and commercial reception. Throughout 2015 and 2016, Khaled gained wider recognition as a public figure due to his social media activity. This, along with several Internet memes, foresaw the release of his ninth studio album, Major Key (2016), which was met with further critical and commercial success as it debuted atop the Billboard 200 and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.\nHis tenth album, Grateful (2017), became his second consecutive number-one album and was preceded by the singles \"I'm the One\" (featuring Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper and Lil Wayne) and \"Wild Thoughts\" (featuring Rihanna and Bryson Tiller), which peaked at numbers one and two on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively. His eleventh album, Father of Asahd (2019), contained the song \"Higher\" (featuring Nipsey Hussle and John Legend), which won Best Rap/Sung Performance at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards\u2014Khaled's first Grammy Award win. His eponymous twelfth album (2021) and thirteenth album, God Did (2022), both debuted atop the Billboard 200. The latter's title track (featuring Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Jay-Z, John Legend and Fridayy) earned three nominations at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards: Song of the Year, Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance.\nOutside of music, Khaled has gained success as a writer, with his book The Keys featuring on the New York Times Best Seller list. He has also performed as an actor for the films Spies in Disguise (2019) and Bad Boys for Life (2020). His record label, We the Best Music Group has distributed his releases since its formation in 2008, though Khaled signed other artists to the imprint including Ace Hood, Kent Jones, Mavado, Flipp Dinero, and Vado, among others.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nKhaled Mohammed Khaled was born on November 26, 1975, in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Palestinian parents who immigrated to the United States; his father was from Mazra'a ash-Sharqiya, and his mother from Ramallah.

During that same month, Balbuena also guest performed on labelmate Pusha T's album Daytona and New York rapper Nas' album Nasir. Her debut studio album, Modus Vivendi (2020), and its follow-up, You Can't Kill Me (2022), were both positively received by music critics despite failing to chart.\nAside from her solo career, Balbuena is also a member of the New Jersey\u2013based musical collective 070, from which she adapted her stage name. The group has released one mixtape, The 070 Project: Chapter 1 (2016).\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBalbuena was born in North Bergen, New Jersey, and is of Dominican descent.

By 2018, the 070 crew was noted to have 11 members, including artists and producers.\nBy 2016, Shake was earning hundreds of thousands of streams on SoundCloud. Soon after posting several songs on SoundCloud, Shake attracted the attention of Miami-based promoter and social media personality YesJulz. After hearing \"Proud\" specifically, YesJulz reached out to Shake on Twitter, quickly signing on to be her manager. Shake broke through with \"Trust Nobody\", released early in that year. In August, Shake collaborated with fellow 070 members Ralphy River, Hack, and Treee Safari on the single \"Honey\". The song featured production from frequent collaborators, The Kompetition, a three-person production group. \"Honey\" simultaneously premiered on Complex and 1 AM Radio on Dash. Vibe commented that the track \"[sounded] tailor\u2013made to rock on dance floors everywhere.\"\nAlso in 2016, Shake signed with Kanye West's GOOD Music label. GOOD Music found out about Shake through Julz, as she played some of Shake's music at a Yeezy fitting, interesting the label's president, Pusha T. After signing Shake, the label picked up her \"Trust Nobody\" track and re-released it in September. Shake spent October and November opening up for English rock band The 1975 during the American leg of their 2016 tour. On December 8, 070 released their first mixtape, The 070 Project: Chapter 1.\n\n\n=== Since 2017: Glitter, Modus Vivendi and You Can't Kill Me ===\nShake modeled for Gypsy Sport's Fall 2017 runway show.

At the time of Glitter's release, media outlets noted that her lyrical content concentrated on her self-esteem issues, drug use, and sexuality. Shake described Glitter as \"about being in a dark place and finding yourself and figuring it out. It's about being in the lowest of lows type of shit.\" Shortly p\n\"Just Us\" is a song by American producer DJ Khaled featuring R&B singer SZA from Khaled's 2019 album Father of Asahd.

According to Billboard's Gil Kaufman, \"Top Off\" is \"a breathless outlaw track about outrunning the police and enjoying the finer things\". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times disliked Future's verse, writing: \"Once you swipe away the numbing hook and pseudo-verse from Future, there, plain as day, is an impressive Jay-Z/Beyonc\u00e9 duet.\" Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork gave a negative review of the song, writing that it is \"more bland than it is bizarrely successful, proof that Khaled's blockbuster-stuffed style often suffocates under the heft of its own bravado\". He opined that the artists' personalities \"are simply too distinct at this point to produce something compelling when shoved together on the same track\". Pat King of Metro named it \"one of the catchiest songs in recent memory about outrunning the cops\". Adreon Patterson of Paste felt that \"the track is a little underwhelming considering the collaborators' musical status\". Serving as a follow-up to \"Shining\" and \"I Got the Keys\", he found the song \"disappointing and anti-climactic\". Tom Breihan of Stereogum praised Khaled for making the song sounds like both a \"fame-flexing celebrity event\" and an \"actual song\". Lauren O'Neill of Noisey complimented Beyonc\u00e9's ability \"to knock every other rapper out of the park with her skill and flow\". Bianca Gracie of Fuse declared that the song lacks innovation and fails to be memorable. \"Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 deserve a harder beat underneath their flows; the juvenile SoundCloud production didn't do them any favors especially on Beyonc\u00e9's opening part.\" Following the release of Father of Asahd, Frazier Tharpe of Complex magazine ranked the features on the album, with Beyonc\u00e9's verse on \"Top Off\" coming in 2nd, behind Nipsey Hussle's verse on \"Higher\". Tharpe commented that \"if there's any benefit to keeping this old dog of a song on the album, it's giving this blackout verse from B a proper home\".\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\nPerformers\n\nDJ Khaled \u2013 composition, production, vocals\nJay-Z \u2013 composition, vocals\nFuture \u2013 composition, vocals\nBeyonc\u00e9 \u2013 composition, production, vocals\nAdditional musician\n\nJoe Zarrillo \u2013 composition, production\nTechnical\n\nManny Marroquin \u2013 mix engineering\nChris Athens \u2013 master engineering\nChris Galland \u2013 engineering\nRobin Florent \u2013 engineering assistance\nScott Desmarais \u2013 engineering assistance\nJuan Pe\u00f1a \u2013 record engineering\nYoung Guru \u2013 record engineering\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"DJ Khaled - Top Off (Audio) ft.

The song was released on July 27, 2018, by We the Best Music Group and Epic Records, the second single from Khaled's eleventh studio album, Father of Asahd (2019). It marks the second collaboration between the artists, following 2017's \"I'm the One\" (which also featured Lil Wayne), from Khaled's tenth studio album Grateful. Khaled produced the song with DaviDior, Sir Nolan, Nic Nac and Poo Bear. The song peaked within the top ten of the charts in Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nIn early July, DJ Khaled shared plans for his song, inspired by his vacation to Cabo San Lucas. \"I'm gonna make my own soap,\" he said. \"So I'm here to announce today\u2014and this is crazy that we're talking about this\u2014I'm gonna make my own soap.\" He also revealed, \"I got a song coming out with Justin Bieber and some more of my great friends on the record. I want it to be a surprise, but it's going to be one of the biggest anthems.\" In a series of teasers on Instagram, he gradually rolled out the news. In one video, Justin and his manager, Scooter Braun, joined in and showcased their southern accents. \"We've always been the best and always will be the best. That's a statement and a half,\" Bieber teased.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nBillboard's Sam Tornow described the song as a potential summer hit with its \"all-star cast, bubbly beats and infectious chorus\". He wrote: \"The crew keeps the hype up all the way through, from Bieber's first chorus until his last. Every collaborator holds his own, accenting each other's different styles while still popping off during his own verse.\" Conversely, Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork called the song \"gratuitous fun that's derivative and shiftless and capitalistic\".\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\nIn the United States, the song debuted at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100, making it Khaled's fourth top-ten song, Bieber's 14th, Chance the Rapper notches his second and Quavo posts his fifth top ten on the chart. The song dropped to number 11 in its second week on the chart.\nIn the United Kingdom, \"No Brainer\" debuted at number one on the Official Trending Chart following its release, with the song set to debut at number 9 of the chart regardless of any added points. In August 2018, the song opened at number four on the UK Singles Chart, where it became DJ Khaled's third and Bieber's 14th top-five single in the country. As for other countries, the song reached the top ten of the charts of Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and Ireland.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video premiered via YouTube an hour after the song's release. Directed by Colin Tilley, the video begins on the set of a movie in Hollywood with \"We The Best\" replacing the typical white Hollywood Sign. Bieber helms the director chair alongside Khaled and his son, Asahd. One part of the video is highly reminiscent of a scene from the film Wayne's World, as Khaled and Justin stand atop the faux clouds. Product placement is heavily displayed throughout the blockbuster, boasting different liquors from Bumbu to Ciroc and Belaire. Quavo injects himself into the colorful scene taking on the role of an artist, meticulously painting away at his blank canvas with a parrot mysteriously chilling out on his shoulder. Chance is the last of the co-stars to make an appearance, and the setting immediately switches to a Gatsby-themed party, as the squad dances the night away.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==\nThe discography of Jeezy, an American rapper, consists of thirteen studio albums, 18 mixtapes, 70 singles (including 38 as a featured artist) and 28 music videos.

Rowe has an older half-sister, Panya Jamila. Her mother is Christian and her father is Muslim. She was raised as a Muslim and continues to follow Islam. \n\nIt's like the belief in one God, all the pillars of Islam et cetera, and I think those are ideas that will never leave me, those make sense in my spirit. It's the way that I connect with God; it has always made sense to me. I think I would love to wear my hijab but I feel like I don't wanna wear my hijab and talk crazy on stage and be in videos with Travis Scott. Like I don't wanna be disrespectful because I have too much love and respect for the religion, for my father, and for myself.\nShe attended a Muslim prep school every day after her regular schooling, where she used to wear hijab.
