{"page_content": "Mark Ruiz (born April 9, 1979 in R\u00edo Piedras, Puerto Rico), is an Olympic diver from Puerto Rico.  Ruiz represented the United States in the 2000 Olympic Games and the 2004 Olympic Games.\n\n\n== Childhood ==\nRuiz took up diving at the age of 9. Upon a coach's suggestion, he moved to the U.S. at 12 to take advantage of the better training system.  During the spring nationals in 1999, he swept all three events (10-meter platform, 3-meter springboard and the non-Olympic event of 1-meter springboard), becoming the first diver since Greg Louganis in 1988 to accomplish this feat.\nRuiz is a graduate of Dr. Phillips High School in Orlando, Florida.  He was a member of the swimming and diving team and was the individual state champion for diving all four years he competed.\n\n\n== Competition ==\nMark's first attempt at the Olympics happened at the 1996 Trials. Ruiz also competes in synchronized diving (springboard and platform), which will have medal events for the first time in Sydney. Ruiz, a four-time national champion in the platform, has already qualified in the platform and 3-meter springboard. He and partner Rio Ramirez finished fourth in the 3-meter springboard at the 2000 World Cup. Mark retired (temporarily) after the 2004 Olympics in Greece.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter his temporary retirement from competition, Ruiz taught diving clinics at the YMCA Aquatic Center. In 2010 Mark's former team, Team Orlando Diving (TOD) affiliated with the YMCA of Central Florida and became YCF Diving.  Mark Ruiz was named head coach and continues in this position today.\n\n\n== Achievements ==\n2004  Olympic Team\n2000  Olympic Team\n2000  Olympic Team Trials, platform, 3-meter springboard, 1st\n2000  National Indoor Championships, platform, 3-meter springboard, 1st\n2000  National Indoor Championships, synchronized, platform, 1st\n2000  World Cup, platform, 5th; 3-meter springboard, 7th\n1999  Summer National Championships, synchronized, 3-meter springboard, 1st, platform, 2nd\n1999  Summer National Championships, platform, 3- and 1-meter springboard, 1st\n1999  Pan American Games, 3-meter springboard, 1st, platform, 5th\n1999  World Cup, platform, 3rd\n1999  Spring National Championships, synchronized, platform, 1st; 3-meter springboard, 3rd\n1999  Spring National Championships, platform, 3- and 1-meter springboard, 1st\n1998  Summer National Championships, synchronized, platform, 1st\n1998  Summer National Championships, platform, 1-meter springboard, 1st; 3-meter springboard, 2nd\n1998  Goodwill Games, 3-meter springboard, 10th; platform, 6th\n1997  World Cup, platform, 5th\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOlympic Trial Photos\nMark Ruiz Bio - YCF Diving\nMark Ruiz Diving Camps\nMark Ruiz at Olympics at Sports-Reference.com (archived)\nRosie M. Vivas (n\u00e9e Ruiz; June 21, 1953 \u2013 July 8, 2019) was a Cuban fraudster who, among other schemes, was declared the winner in the female category for the 84th Boston Marathon in 1980, only to have her title stripped eight days after the race when it was discovered that she had not run the entire course. She is believed to have jumped onto the course about a half-mile before the finish.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nRuiz was born in Havana, Cuba, and moved to Memphis, Florida, with her family in 1962 when she was eight years old. After immigrating to the United States, Ruiz was separated from her mother and lived with aunts, uncles, and cousins in Hollywood, Florida. In 1972, she graduated from South Broward High School and then attended Wayne State College in Nebraska. She graduated with a degree in music in 1977.\n\n\n== New York City Marathon ==\nShe moved to New York City in the 1970s, eventually finding work with Metal Traders, a commodities firm. In 1979, she qualified for the New York City Marathon and was credited with a time of 2:56:29, the 11th woman overall \u2014 enough for her to qualify for the Boston Marathon.\nRuiz's application for the NYC marathon arrived after the cut-off date for the race, but she received special dispensation from the New York Road Runners due to her claim that she was dying of brain cancer.\nAfter the 1980 Boston Marathon, New York City Marathon officials investigated Ruiz's run and concluded that she cheated and did not run the entire course, so on April 25, 1980, she was retroactively disqualified from the race. \nFreelance photographer Susan Morrow reported meeting her on the subway during the New York City Marathon and accompanying her from the subway to the race. She lost touch with Ruiz after that, but came forward when the news of Ruiz's dubious Boston win broke. According to Morrow, she met Ruiz on the subway and together they walked a distance to the finishing area, where Ruiz identified herself as an injured runner. She was escorted to a first aid station and volunteers marked her down as having completed the marathon, thus qualifying her for the Boston Marathon.\nNew York City Marathon officials launched an investigation and could not find any sign of Ruiz near the finish line. On April 25, based on this and other evidence, the games committee of the New York City Marathon retroactively disqualified Ruiz from the 1979 race, with marathon director Fred Lebow saying she could not possibly have run the entire course.\n\n\n== Boston Marathon ==\nOn April 21, 1980, Ruiz appeared to win the Boston Marathon's female category with a time of 2:31:56. Her time would have been the fastest female time in Boston Marathon history as well as the third-fastest female time ever recorded in any marathon. \nHowever, suspicions mounted about Ruiz almost from the beginning. Men's winner Bill Rodgers, who had just won his third straight Boston Marathon, noticed that Ruiz could not recall many things that most runners know by heart, such as intervals and splits. Other observers noticed that Ruiz was not panting or coated in sweat, and her thighs were less lean and muscular than would be expected for a world-class runner. She later released stress-test results showing her resting heart rate as 76. Most female marathoners have a resting heart rate in the 50s or lower.\nIn addition, her time of 2:31:56 was an unusual improvement, more than 25 minutes ahead of her reported time in the New York City Marathon six months earlier. When asked by a reporter why she did not seem fatigued after the grueling race, she said, \"I got up with a lot of energy this morning.\" Some female competitors thought it was odd that, when asked what she had noticed about the suburb of Wellesley while running through it, she did not mention the students of Wellesley College, who traditionally cheer loudly for the first female runners as they pass the campus. \nMost seriously, no other runners could recall seeing her.

Ruivivar's breakthrough role came in 1999 as Carlos Nieto, a paramedic in the action/drama series Third Watch (1999\u20132005), which centers on the life of police officers, paramedics, and firemen of a fictional precinct and fire station in New York City. In the show, Carlos was a Hawaiian-born Filipino-American who was abandoned by his family and spent his youth in various foster homes. \nAfter Third Watch, Ruivivar remained in the drama genre, usually playing a police officer, detective or FBI agent in shows such as Traveler, Quantico, Numb3rs, Criminal Minds, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (all 2007)  and Lie to Me (2009).\nIn 2010, he had a main role in ABC's The Whole Truth as Alejo Salazar.

Due to sharing the name of the Marvel character better known as Deadpool, Wilson has been referred to in the media as the \"Deadpool Killer\". Wilson was sentenced to death in 2024 after being found guilty of first-degree murder, among other charges. Prior to the murders, Wilson had a criminal history dating back to 2012, including convictions for burglary, grand theft, and firearms offenses.\n\n\n== Life and early crimes ==\nWade Steven Wilson was born on May 20, 1994 to teenage parents, and was adopted by Steve and Candace Wilson and raised in Tallahassee, Florida, where he was attending Chiles High School. During his youth, Wilson was often described as \"troubled\" and was reportedly involved in minor criminal activities and substance abuse. He also sustained several head injuries during his childhood and adolescence, which he later cited as contributing to his feelings of instability. \nHis encounters with the law began in 2012 in Leon County where he was involved in various incidents, including burglary, assault, and firearm-related offenses. In November 2013, Wilson was sentenced to prison for burglary and grand theft, serving until September 2014. In 2015, he faced charges of sexual battery and kidnapping after a woman accused him of assaulting her in his vehicle following a party. However, he was acquitted of these charges by a jury. By 2017, Wilson was incarcerated again for stealing firearms, serving until July 2018. Later in 2018, he was mentioned in connection with the case of Denise Williams, who was convicted of conspiring to murder her husband. During this time, Wilson allegedly attempted to fabricate evidence and even offered to kill Williams. In February 2019, his former girlfriend reported an incident in which he allegedly assaulted and strangled her. Although she initially accused him of kidnapping and rape, investigators did not pursue these charges due to a lack of evidence and an existing no-contact order. On July 1, 2019, Wilson was arrested again for battery.\n\n\n== Murders ==\nOn October 7, 2019, Wilson committed two murders within hours. The first victim, Kristine Melton, was strangled in her home after Wilson had met her at a live music bar. Later that day, Diane Ruiz, a mother of two and a bartender, was strangled and subsequently run over multiple times after being lured into Melton's car under false pretenses. He called his biological father, Stephen Testasecca, soon afterwards and confessed to murdering the women. Testasecca and his wife called the police and Wilson was arrested the following day. He told detectives that he would be willing to \"do it again\".\n\n\n== Legal proceedings and public reaction ==\nDuring legal proceedings, evidence of Wilson's mental health was presented, including testimony about his brain injuries. A neurologist testified that brain scans showed trauma and impairment which might explain some of Wilson's impulsive behaviors. However, experts for the prosecution argued that drug abuse was a more significant factor in his actions. The defense claimed that Wilson's drug abuse could have impaired his judgment at the time of the crime.\nWilson's father, Stephen Testasecca, testified against him in court, recounting details of his confession over the phone. Testasecca stated that his son ran over Ruiz after realizing she was not yet dead, and also could not explain his motives beyond \"I just wanted to do it.\" More than the required 8 out of the 12 jurors recommended the death penalty for Wilson (9 for the murder of Melton and 10 for the murder of Ruiz). Having the power to take or disregard the jury's suggestion, judge Nicholas Thompson imposed two death sentences. Wilson is appealing the decision to the Supreme Court of Florida.\nWilson's sentencing was marked by public interest and controversy, including numerous messages from individuals pl\nDr. Phillips High School is a public high school in Dr. Phillips, Florida, United States, near Orlando.\nIt serves the Dr. Phillips census-designated place (CDP), the Bay Hill CDP, and the residential portion of Lake Buena Vista.\n\n\n== History ==\nDr. Phillips High School opened in fall of 1987 and was built for about 2,500 students in the Dr. Phillips area of southwest Orange County, Florida.\nThe campus sits on 55 acres (220,000 m2) in the Orlando city limits and unincorporated Orange County, opposite Universal Orlando. The school serves as a Visual and Performing Arts Magnet and Center for International Studies magnet for Orange County Public Schools.\nThe school's first principal, Bill Spoone, went on to be elected to the Orange County School Board. The football stadium is named after him. The school's gymnasium is named after its second principal, Larry Payne, and is nicknamed \"The House of Payne.\"\nThe school opened with enrollment above capacity and began using portable classrooms on the North Campus, formerly known as the 9th Grade Center. Due to overflow from main campus, many non-freshman classes were moved into additional portable classrooms at the 9th Grade Center, which was renamed North Campus, with the main campus renamed the South Campus. Portable classrooms are still used on the North Campus and are primarily for freshman-level classes.\nAs of the 2014\u201315 school year the school had 3,641 students, of whom 35% were white, 32% African American, 24% Hispanic, 7% Asian, and 2% multiracial.\nThe school underwent a series of renovations which finished in 2015. A new building has been added, along with new VPA classrooms on the South Campus.\n\n\n== Athletics ==\nThe press box at Bill Spoone Stadium is dedicated to Mike Murray, \"The Voice of the Panthers\" since the school opened its doors in 1987. A full-time employee of a large aerospace contractor and not formally employed by the school, Murray was elected to their Athletic Hall of Fame in 2001.\nThe school's baseball facility is John Barbati Field. In 1992, the baseball facilities were completely renovated with a state of the art press box, team office and facilities. The new facilities were designed and constructed by William P. Riegert, CEO of Cox Associates, Architects, and donated to the OC School Board in a dedication ceremony on February 22, 1992. Accepting for the OC School Board were Assistant Superintendent Dave Wofford, Assistant Superintendent Dave Sojourner, Superintendent Don Shaw, Bill Spoone, and Bill Thompson. Today the Press Box is dedicated to Scott Muhlhann, a baseball player and 1992 school valedictorian who died of cancer in 1998.\nThe mascot for Dr. Phillips is the Panther; specifically, the Florida panther.

Ruiz is of Puerto Rican descent, and is the first Latino boxer to win a world heavyweight title.\n\n\n== Amateur career ==\n1991: Competed as a light heavyweight at the World Championships in Sydney, Australia.

Result was:\nLost to Jeremy Williams PTS\n\n\n== Professional career ==\n\n\n=== First reign as WBA heavyweight champion ===\nAfter Lennox Lewis defeated Evander Holyfield for the undisputed (WBA, WBC, and IBF) heavyweight title in late 1999, the WBA ordered Lewis to defend the title against mandatory challenger Ruiz, but Lewis refused. Though he had been undefeated since his 1st round 19 second loss against David Tua in 1996, the level of competition Ruiz had been facing was suspect and the only name he had beaten (to date) was a nearly 40-year-old Tony Tucker.\nRuiz and his management sued, claiming that WBA rules entitled him to a title shot. A judge agreed, but rather than face Ruiz in a bout that was seen as commercially unattractive, Lewis instead fought Michael Grant, considered to be a very worthy contender at the time, having knocked out a series of recognized \"name\" opponents on HBO. After learning of this, the judge decreed that upon entering the ring against Grant on April 29, 2000, Lewis would automatically forfeit the WBA title.\n\n\n=== Ruiz vs. Holyfield ===\n\nRuiz fought former champion Holyfield to fill the vacancy on August 12, 2000, losing by unanimous decision (this result made Holyfield the first to win a world heavyweight title on four occasions). Many observers and boxing reporters felt that the underdog Ruiz had done enough to win.\nDue to this controversial decision, the WBA ordered an immediate rematch in early 2001, and Ruiz won the WBA title. Some critics still believe the decision was controversial (Ruiz was on the ground for a few minutes after Holyfield appeared to deliver a low punch to the groin). Footage following the match showed that the punch may have been legal, but it wasn't disputed.\nRuiz defended the title twice: a controversial draw in a third match against Holyfield where the press believed Holyfield to have won, and a disqualification victory against Kirk Johnson where the Canadian contender was disqualified for repeated low blows in the tenth round. Ruiz was accused in both the second Holyfield fight and the Johnson fight of faking low blows that actually seemed to be closer to his beltline than his groin (although Johnson was shown on replays to hit Ruiz below the belt several times).\n\n\n=== Ruiz vs Jones Jr. ===\n\nOn March 1, 2003, Ruiz was contracted to fight Roy Jones Jr., who at the time was The Ring light heavyweight champion. If Jones was to beat Ruiz in the fight, he would join Bob Fitzsimmons, Michael Spinks, and Michael Moorer as the only three fighters to win titles at light heavyweight and heavyweight as well as becoming the second fighter (Fitzsimmons being the first) to win titles at both middleweight and heavyweight. Ruiz, who said referee Jay Nady \"wouldn't let me fight my fight\", lost a unanimous decision to Jones and moved back into the WBA's contender pool.\n\n\n=== Second reign as WBA heavyweight champion ===\n\nRuiz, however, would receive another shot before 2003 was out. As champion Jones was required to face the WBA's number one contender, former WBO champion Vitali Klitschko. Neither the Jones nor the Klitschko camps were able to agree to a fight by an imposed deadline, so Jones became a champion-in-recess. Klitschko, however, did not want to fight the #2 contender, former WBC, IBF, and lineal champion Hasim Rahman, for the interim championship. After David Tua, the #3 contender, also turned down th\nWilliam Mark (Berwick-upon-Tweed, 6 March 1782 - Alhaur\u00edn el Grande, 13 January 1849) was a British consul and governor of the British colony in southern Spain, as well as the founder of the English Cemetery in Malaga.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nBorn into a large, poor family, at the age of eleven he was taken into the home of a textile merchant who taught him the trade. When he was eighteen, he enlisted in the British Royal Navy, where he was well regarded for his knowledge of accountancy.\nThree years after enlisting in the Navy, he was invited to dine on the Victory, where he met Admiral Horatio Nelson, under whom he served for some months. This episode was widely celebrated by Mark, who wrote a book about his experiences in the service of the Admiral.\nIn 1808 he was posted as an accountant to Gibraltar, where he met Emma Bedwell, whom he married in 1810.\n\n\n== Diplomatic career ==\n\nHe was assigned to Malaga to succeed the elderly incumbent consul. Mark and his family arrived in Malaga in 1816, although he did not take up his post as consul until 1824.\nThanks to his efforts as consul to the then governor of Malaga, Jos\u00e9 Manso, he managed to obtain the concession of a burial place for the British colony in the English Cemetery of Malaga, making it the first of the Anglican Protestant cemeteries to be established in Spain.\nAlso thanks to his dealings with the Spanish authorities, he managed to rescue the body of young Robert Boyd, who had been shot on the beach of San Andr\u00e9s, in M\u00e1laga, as a result of his participation in the pronunciamiento of the General Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Torrijos. Boyd's body was the second to be buried in the English Cemetery.\nHe served as consul until 1837. He was succeeded by his son, William Penrose Mark, as consul and governor of the British colony in Spain.\n\n\n== Death ==\nDied in Alhaur\u00edn el Grande, near M\u00e1laga, on 13 January 1849 and was buried in the English Cemetery in Malaga, where he has a funerary monument.\nIn 2007, the crypt where his grave is located along with seven other members of the Mark family was discovered by chance underneath the monument to his memory. In addition to William Mark's grave, the crypt also contained the graves of his wife Emma B.

Ruiz entered the adult film industry in September 2005 when she was 18 years old under the name Jenna Presley. In 2010, she was named by Maxim as one of the 12 top female stars in porn. Complex ranked her 17th on its list of \"The Top 100 Hottest Porn Stars (Right Now)\" in 2011.\nDuring her time in the adult film industry, Presley used crystal meth, heroin, and cocaine (to try to lose weight), as well as ecstasy and oxycontin. She witnessed her boyfriend being fatally-stabbed by a motorcycle gang.\nAfter three years in the industry, Ruiz's grandparents took her to the Rock Church in San Diego, where \"she raised her hand to receive Jesus as her personal Lord and Savior\" after hearing a sermon by preacher Miles McPherson. Further inspired by Rachel Collins, a Christian pastor at XXX Church, Ruiz left the adult film industry in December 2012 after she completed her last scene in Las Vegas.\n\n\n=== Ministry ===\nIn a 2013 interview, Ruiz discussed a book in the making about her past struggles with drugs in the industry and about her new faith in Christianity. In August 2013, she appeared on The View with Craig Gross, pastor of the Triple X Church, to discuss her conversion to Christianity.\nAfter leaving the pornography industry, she preached at Cornerstone Church of San Diego.\nIn 2016, Ruiz married Richard De La Mora, a pastor at Cornerstone Church.

He was a major figure in the salsa rom\u00e1ntica subgenre that was popular in the 1980s and early 1990s. \nDuring his youth, he developed a passion for percussion, later confessing that this would have been his second choice after singing. Fan reaction to his work was diverse. Within the Latino community, he was regarded as \"one of the best salseros ever\", and Puerto Ricans abroad were particularly fond of it because it brought back memories of their homeland. Among non-Latinos, some admitted that his music had been responsible for their interest in salsa as a genre and even the Spanish language.\nAs salsa moved closer to pop music, and toned down the eroticism in its lyrics during the 1990s, Ruiz was challenged, along with other salsa rom\u00e1ntica performers, but he managed to record a number of hits during his late career. He suffered from years of drug and alcohol abuse. His personal shortcomings were exploited by the tabloid media but had little impact on his popularity. In 1998, Ruiz died due to complications from liver disease.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nFrankie Ruiz  was born in Paterson, New Jersey to Frank Torresola and Hilda Ruiz, a Puerto Rican couple who had moved to the city. After being born, he was initially adopted by his grandmother, Concepci\u00f3n, as his mother was 15 years old. Afterwards his custody passed to his parents and he was raised in Union City, along his brothers Viti and Juanito. He received his primary and secondary school education in Paterson, where his father served as education commissioner.\nAt the age of 5, Ruiz played percussion instruments at the Roberto Clemente Park in Trenton and at other city venues. One of these performances earned him an award at a show held at the Majestic Theater in Paterson. During the following years, he continued performing with the support of his parents, meeting artists like Tito Puente in the process. Despite this, Ruiz was not enrolled in formal singing classes and mostly depended on practice. During this time, he developed a friendship with Joe Salvador, through which he met Rosemary Salvador, whose family sponsored his performances and those of his brothers. Both joined a local music group led by Charlie L\u00f3pez, known as Orquesta Nueva (otherwise known as The Charlie L\u00f3pez Orquesta), as vocalist and bass player, and started performing salsa at talent shows. He recorded his first song \"Salsa Buena\" with this band, which was followed by \"Borinquen\".\n\n\n== Musical career ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings as a vocalist ===\nAfter their parents divorced, Hilda Torresola relocated to Mayag\u00fcez, Puerto Rico with the siblings. There they settled at Barrio Balboa to live with his grandmother, and other family members. By his early teens, Ruiz had begun performing at nightclubs. He became interested in a salsa band called La Soluci\u00f3n, directed by Roberto Rivera, which he was able to join after multiple attempts. With this band, Ruiz re-recorded a new version of \"Salsa Buena\". As he became its lead singer and recorded the hit single titled \"La Rueda\" (\"The Wheel\"), the band was renamed Frankie Ruiz y La Soluci\u00f3n and he toured with it for three years. Ruiz became an alcoholic and drug user following the death of his mother in a car accident and the murder of his girlfriend, an aspect of his personal life that was emphasized by the media.\nRuiz continued performing with other bands including La Dictadora and La Moderna Vibraci\u00f3n. In 1982, Ruiz joined Tommy Olivencia and his Primerisima Orquesta, replacing Gilberto Santa Rosa as vocalist. He recorded the hit singles \"Fantas\u00eda de un capintero\" and \"Como lo hacen\", which were followed by \"Lo Dudo\", \"Primero Fui Yo\", Como Una Estrella\", and \"Que Se Mueran de Envidia\". In total, Ruiz participated in the recording of three albums with Olivencia: Un tri\u00e1ngulo de triunfo, Tommy Olivencia and Celebrando otro aniversario. As his career centered around\nPablo Ruiz Picasso (25 October 1881 \u2013 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist, and theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France. One of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) and the anti-war painting Guernica (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War.\nPicasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years, painting in a naturalistic manner through his childhood and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, his style changed as he experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas. After 1906, the Fauvist work of the older artist Henri Matisse motivated Picasso to explore more radical styles, beginning a fruitful rivalry between the two artists, who subsequently were often paired by critics as the leaders of modern art.\nPicasso's output, especially in his early career, is often periodized. While the names of many of his later periods are debated, the most commonly accepted periods in his work are the Blue Period (1901\u20131904), the Rose Period (1904\u20131906), the African-influenced Period (1907\u20131909), Analytic Cubism (1909\u20131912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912\u20131919), also referred to as the Crystal period. Much of Picasso's work of the late 1910s and early 1920s is in a neoclassical style, and his work in the mid-1920s often has characteristics of Surrealism. His later work often combines elements of his earlier styles.\nExceptionally prolific throughout the course of his long life, Picasso achieved universal renown and immense fortune for his revolutionary artistic accomplishments, and became one of the best-known figures in 20th-century art.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nPicasso was born at 23:15 on 25 October 1881, in the city of M\u00e1laga, Andalusia, in southern Spain. He was the first child of Don Jos\u00e9 Ruiz y Blasco (1838\u20131913) and Mar\u00eda Picasso y L\u00f3pez. Picasso's family was of middle-class background. His father was a painter who specialized in naturalistic depictions of birds and other game. For most of his life, Ruiz was a professor of art at the School of Crafts and a curator of a local museum.\nPicasso's birth certificate and the record of his baptism include very long names, combining those of various saints and relatives. Ruiz y Picasso were his paternal and maternal surnames, respectively, per Spanish custom. The surname \"Picasso\" comes from Liguria, a coastal region of north-western Italy. Pablo's maternal great-grandfather, Tommaso Picasso, moved to Spain around 1807.\nPicasso showed a passion and a skill for drawing from an early age. According to his mother, his first words were \"piz, piz\", a shortening of l\u00e1piz, the Spanish word for \"pencil\". From the age of seven, Picasso received formal artistic training from his father in figure drawing and oil painting. Ruiz was a traditional academic artist and instructor, who believed that proper training required disciplined copying of the masters, and drawing the human body from plaster casts and live models. His son became preoccupied with art to the detriment of his classwork.\nThe family moved to A Coru\u00f1a in 1891, where his father became a professor at the School of Fine Arts. They stayed for almost four years. On one occasion, the father found his son painting over his unfinished sketch of a pigeon. Observing the precision of his son's technique, an apocryphal story relates, Ruiz felt that the thirteen-year-old Picasso had surpassed him, and vowed to give up painting, though paintings by him exist from later years.\nIn 1895, Picasso was traumatized when his seven-year-old sister, Conchita, died of diphtheria. After her death, the family moved to Barcelona, \nAnthony Joshua vs. Andy Ruiz Jr. was a heavyweight professional boxing match contested between undefeated and unified WBA (Super), IBF, WBO, and IBO champion Anthony Joshua, and former world title challenger Andy Ruiz Jr. The bout took place on June 1, 2019, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. Joshua was originally scheduled to face undefeated WBA No. 2 and WBO No. 3 ranked heavyweight Jarrell Miller, who was replaced by Ruiz Jr. after Miller failed three drug tests. \nAfter coming in as a 25\u20131 underdog, in a shocking upset, Ruiz Jr. won the match via technical knockout in the seventh round, ending Joshua's undefeated record and becoming the new unified heavyweight champion. Ruiz became the only American boxer to win the unified heavyweight championship since Hasim Rahman in 2001. The fight is considered one of the biggest upsets in boxing history, drawing comparisons to Mike Tyson vs. Buster Douglas in 1990 and Lennox Lewis vs. Hasim Rahman in 2001.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAndy Ruiz Jr. failed to become heavyweight champion back in December 2016, when he lost to Joseph Parker by close but somewhat debatable Majority decision. Ruiz stated how he felt like he won and wanted a rematch but the fight never took place. Meanwhile, Parker made two defenses of his WBO title until he lost to unified heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua in March 2018. Joshua since then made his next defense against Alexander Povetkin, which he stopped in the seventh round.\nJoshua had repeatedly spoken of his desire to fight the undefeated WBC champion Deontay Wilder for all four world titles, but with the American expected to fight Tyson Fury in a rematch in Las Vegas in April before the fight was cancelled, he needed an alternative opponent and insisted Dillian Whyte would then be the leading candidate. The 30-year-old Whyte called Joshua out once Derek Chisora had recovered from his 11th-round knockout, but Joshua, 29, and unusually booed by many of those present at The O2, said: \u201cIf Deontay Wilder is serious and he is going to fight Tyson Fury and doesn\u2019t want to become undisputed champion, Dillian you will get a title shot.\"\nOn 29 December 2018, with Joshua's Wembley date still on hold, Hearn stated that Whyte was the frontrunner to challenge Joshua. Whilst still waiting for Hearn to contact him, Whyte claimed to hear rumours that Joshua would cancel the Wembley date and instead fight American contender Jarrell Miller at Madison Square Garden. On 12 January 2019, Whyte revealed that he had turned down a \"severe lowball\" offer from Joshua to fight him in a rematch. Whyte did not reveal the figure, however he claimed it was lower than what he received against Chisora in December 2018. By 21 January, Hearn stated there was a possibility Joshua would fight in the United States instead. According to Hearn, it was Joshua who was making the offer for the Whyte fight. Whyte claimed Joshua did not want to fight him, as he had known since September 2018, that he would be fighting in April 2019, yet did not make any offers. On 1 February, Hearn admitted it was becoming highly unlikely that Joshua would still fight at Wembley Stadium on 13 April. On 2 February, Whyte claimed the Joshua fight \"was dead\" and he was to look at other options, including a potential fight with Dominic Breazeale. According to Miller, Joshua initially offered Whyte $3 million, then increased the offer to $5 million, only to go down to $3.5 million.\nOn 8 February, terms were agreed for Joshua to defend his unified heavyweight titles against Miller (23-0-1, 20 KOs) on 1 June at Madison Square Garden in New York City, marking Joshua's US debut. The event became the highest grossing pre-sale in the arena's boxing history. It was reported that Joshua would pocket \u00a319.3 million (equivalent to $25 million). Another report claimed Joshua was to earn an estimated $32 million. Miller's deal with DAZN ensured he received a career-high purse of $4.875 million, which would include two mor\nWhen Evil Lurks (Spanish: Cuando acecha la maldad) is a 2023 supernatural horror film written and directed by Demi\u00e1n Rugna.

It received a theatrical release by IFC Films on October 6, and debuted on the streaming service Shudder on October 27.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe morning after hearing gunshots in the woods near the land where they work, brothers Pedro and Jaime discover an eviscerated corpse, which leads them to a nearby shack where Mar\u00eda Elena, an elderly woman, and her two sons, Uriel and Eduardo, are in hiding. Uriel has become a \"Rotten\", a being possessed by an unborn demon awaiting physical birth. The corpse was that of a \"Cleaner\", a professional who was to kill Uriel and exorcise the demon before it could possess others.\nThe authorities dismiss the demon as not their problem. The landowner, Ruiz, suggests removing Uriel from the shack and dumping him away from his land. After driving several hundred kilometers, the men realize that Uriel has fallen off the truck somewhere along the way. Unable to find him, Ruiz declares the matter resolved and returns home. The next morning, one of Ruiz's goats has become possessed. Ruiz's wife Jimena warns against using guns because they will only spread the infectious possession, but Ruiz shoots the animal with his shotgun. A possessed Jimena then kills Ruiz and commits suicide. That night, Eduardo knocks on Pedro and Jaime's door. Eduardo's mother disappeared after the men took Uriel, and he found Ruiz and Jimena dead. Afraid to return to his shack alone, he begs the men to let him stay the night. Pedro allows Eduardo to sleep in their shed, provided that he surrenders his pistol and promises to leave at sunrise.\nThe next morning, Jaime and Pedro plan to leave town with their families to be safe. Jaime gets their mother Sara while Pedro goes to his ex-wife Sabrina and his two children, Santino and Jair. Sabrina lives with Leonardo, her new husband. The family dog, who previously licked Pedro's demon-mucked clothes, mauls Vicky (Leonardo and Sabrina's daughter) dragging her outside. Leonardo shoots the dog despite Pedro's warning. Pedro returns to Sabrina and discovers that Vicky is back, and seemingly normal. As Pedro steals a car and drives away with his sons, a possessed Leonardo rams his truck into Sabrina and Vicky, who later dances gleefully.\nAfter Pedro picks up Jaime and Sara, the assembled family leaves town. They meet up with Mirta, a former Cleaner and Jaime's acquaintance from the city, who invites them to stay overnight. Mirta warns Jaime about Jair, who exhibits signs of possession. Jaime dismisses this as related to Jair's autism. Mirta explains that they must find and kill Uriel using the appropriate ritual to prevent the demon from being fully born. Sabrina eventually kidnaps Santino. Jaime chases after her while Mirta and Pedro take Mirta's truck to search for Uriel. Jaime reaches Sabrina only to find that she has killed Santino and is eating his brains. Furious, he runs Sabrina down and pins her to a tree. Sara stays behind to wait with Jair, who begins walking unassisted and speaking without impediment.\nPedro and Mirta's search leads to a schoolhouse filled with possessed children who killed all the nearby adults and worked to conceal Uriel. Uriel is hidden under an auditorium's stage, and Pedro tries to unearth him as Mirta sets up the exorcising ritual. Losing his patience and believing that a nearby fire axe might help dismember and move Uriel, Pedro runs to the office only to be locked in by the children. While he is occupied, the children kill Mirta and dismantle her equipment. Getting back to the auditorium too late to save Mirta, an angry Pedro beats Uriel to death. The demon is then born out\nRio Noble Ruiz (born May 22, 1994) is an American professional baseball third baseman for the Conspiradores de Quer\u00e9taro of the Mexican League.

As a teenager, he walked across the Mexico \u2013 United States border every day to attend a high school in nearby Eagle Pass, Texas, from which he graduated as valedictorian just three years after beginning to learn English.

Ruiz succeeded Sanders in the CEO's seat in 2002, and was named chairman of the board in 2004.\nRuiz endorsed the decision to buy ATI, which led to a period of financial reverses. Ruiz survived rumors of his ouster in late 2007. However, he resigned as CEO on July 18, 2008, after AMD reported its seventh consecutive quarterly loss.\nRuiz took AMD \"off death watch,\" according to a leading industry analyst. As CEO, Ruiz led AMD to \"important technical accomplishments and strides in its competition against Intel,\" but \" he was never able to stanch the company's persistent financial losses.\" Analyst Rob Enderle gives Ruiz credit for the strategy to spin off the manufacturing operations, \"relieving AMD of the cost of running chip plants and allowing more focus on chip design.\" Ruiz was behind the deal in which an Abu Dhabi government arm funded the new venture.\nAccording to the New York Times, \"From about 2003 to 2006, A.M.D. offered a line of chips that analysts and many computer makers hailed as superior to Intel\u2019s products. Executives from A.M.D. contended that Intel blunted the adoption of these chips through its financial arrangements.\"\nIn 2010, the Federal Trade Commission settled a number of anti-competition complaints against Intel. Intel \"accepted all the terms of the settlement without admitting that it had committed any anticompetitive acts.\"  In 2009, AMD \"settled its own antitrust complaint against Intel in November with Intel agreeing to pay $1.25 billion.\"\nIn February 2012, the Albany Times Union looked back at the June 2006 announcement by Ruiz and then-current New York Governor George Pataki that AMD and then its spin-off GlobalFoundries \"would be building the world's most advanced 'chip fab' on the planet.\" The news \"vault[ed] the Capital Region into the global technology spotlight virtually overnight.\" Pataki said GlobalFoundries is likely to end up spending $7 billion and hiring 2,000 employees at the plant, with 9,000 additional jobs created as a result.\nRuiz was named Chairman of AMD spin-off GlobalFoundries in March 2009. He resigned concurrent with reports that identified Ruiz as the previously unnamed AMD executive who allegedly discussed AMD's plans for the spin-off with an investment manager before it had been publicly disclosed.

Her body was discovered in garbage bags on 28 December 1991 without any identification. A postmortem found strangulation to be the likely cause of death. Animal hairs were found on the body, and newspaper was stuffed inside her mouth.\nOn its removal, fingerprints in what appeared to be blood were present but could not be immediately identified. Investigators spent many weeks attempting to identify the victim. A sustained and significant media campaign was also conducted. Investigators were eventually contacted by a former associate of the victim who recognised her as Vivianne Ruiz.\nInvestigators discovered Ruiz had been in a relationship with Richard White, a convicted criminal with a history of assault and drug trafficking. He had grown to know Ruiz through her work as a prostitute and dancer in the Kings Cross nightclubs in Sydney. Investigators discovered White had left Australia shortly after Ruiz was found murdered. The fingerprint found on the newspaper Ruiz's killer had left in her throat was initially considered not to belong to White. Later testing demonstrated that a tonal reverse had occurred, a rare event where the valleys between fingerprint ridges transfer blood from the grooves of the fingerprint, as opposed to its ridges.\nInvestigators eventually tracked White to England, where he was living with relatives. A warrant was sought in England for his arrest, which was eventually made in Newcastle by local detectives and Scotland Yard. White returned to Australia to face trial for the murder. After two trials were aborted due to his abnormal conduct, he was eventually found guilty in 1996 and sentenced to the maximum jail term permitted in New South Wales at the time, which was fifteen years with a minimum of nine before being eligible for parole.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe body of a female was located on the side of a suburban street in Sydney, Australia on 28 December 1991. She was wrapped in garbage bags, indicating to investigators that the victim was murdered elsewhere and transported to the location. She had suffered head injuries, and officers observed something inside her mouth that appeared at the time to be paper. A ligature was around her throat. There was no identification found on the body. Investigators described the murder as a \"frenzied attack\", and \"a callous, very brutal murder\".\n\n\n== Post-mortem ==\nA post mortem examination found the victim weighed 62 kg (137 lb) and was  1.61 m (5 ft 3 in) tall, and was estimated to be between 16 and 25 years old. The victim was found to have suffered injuries, with a wound on her head and strangulation marks on the throat. Bruises indicated she had been further injured after her death.\nNewspaper was removed from the mouth and revealed to be two full-sized sheets of the Sydney Morning Herald, dated 10 December 1991. Three distinct fingerprint patterns were identified. The fingerprints were photographed, and then enhanced with ninhydrin, an organic compound that can detect fingerprints. The practice is commonly used by forensic investigators in the analysis of latent fingerprints on porous surfaces such as paper, as the amino acids in sweat secretions that gather on a finger's unique ridges transfer to surfaces when touched. Exposure of the surface to ninhydrin converts the amino acids into visibly coloured products and thus reveals the print. Once completed, the fingerprint was fed into the police fingerprint database, though no match was found. \nA significant number of animal hairs were also found during the post-mortem. Tests showed that these were from a domestic dog, possibly a German Shepherd.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nBy the time the post-mortem was over, the body had not been identified.

Ruiz's father, Cesar Edwin Ruiz, was killed when he was struck by a motorist while helping a driver change tires when Cesar was eight years old. He attended Camden High School before transferring to IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida after his sophomore year. Ruiz was named an Under Armour All-American as a senior in 2017. Rated a four-star recruit and the top center in his class nationally, Ruiz committed to play college football at Michigan over offers from Florida, Auburn, LSU, and several other top-level programs.\n\n\n== College career ==\nRuiz played in ten games as a freshman, starting five games at right guard and long snapper with his first career start coming against Minnesota. Ruiz started all 13 of Michigan's games at center as a sophomore and was named third-team All-Big Ten Conference by the league's coaches and was an honorable mention selection by the media.\nRuiz was named to the Watchlist for the Rimington Trophy going into his junior season. Ruiz started all 13 of Michigan's games at center, allowing only eight total quarterback pressures in 447 snaps and was named the best pass blocking center in college football by Pro Football Focus, and was named second-team All-Big Ten by the coaches and third-team by the media. Following the end of the season, Ruiz announced that he had decided to forgo his senior season in order to enter the 2020 NFL draft. Over three seasons, Ruiz played in 36 games for Michigan with 31 games started.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\n\nRuiz was drafted by the New Orleans Saints in the first round with the 24th overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. Ruiz made his NFL debut on September 21, 2020, on Monday Night Football against the Las Vegas Raiders, playing on six snaps at right guard.\nIn the 2021 season opening win against the Green Bay Packers, Ruiz started the game at right guard, but played center for rest of the game after Erik McCoy suffered a calf injury in the first quarter. He continued being the team's starting center for the next four games until McCoy returned in Week 7 and Ruiz moved back to right guard.\nOn December 20, 2022, the Saints placed Ruiz on season\u2013ending injured reserve with a foot injury. The next day, it was revealed that Ruiz had suffered a Lisfranc fracture during the team's final offensive possession in Week 15 against the Atlanta Falcons.\nOn September 9, 2023, Ruiz signed a four-year, $44 million contract extension with the Saints with $30 million guaranteed.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nNew Orleans Saints bio\nMichigan Wolverines bio\nCesar Ruiz on Twitter\nKyle Prandi (born June 19, 1979 in Cleveland, Ohio) is an American diver and Olympian from Strongsville, Ohio.

An infielder, Ruiz played in Major League Baseball for the Cincinnati Reds and California Angels from 1964 through 1971. He was the only major-league player ever to pinch-hit for Johnny Bench. He is, however, best remembered for a play he made his rookie season. His steal of home against the Philadelphia Phillies on September 21, 1964 has entered baseball folklore. Viewed by most over the years as \"mad\" or \"zany,\" the play received a revisionist defense that put it in perspective as a daring and worthwhile gamble. It is often viewed as the turning point of the Phillies late season standings collapse in 1964.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nRuiz was born in Santo Domingo, Cuba, on December 5, 1938. His father, who owned a cigar factory, wanted Giraldo to succeed him in running the business. However, Chico attended college, where he studied architecture. His brother, Julio, later headed the labor force of Cubatabaco, which absorbed the Sabl\u00f3n business and various other private-sector tobacco enterprises.\nRuiz signed with the Cincinnati Redlegs in 1958 at age 19. He was among the last of the Cuban players to make it out of Cuba before the borders were sealed. He batted .275 with 28 home runs over six seasons in their farm system before making the renamed Cincinnati Reds out of spring training in 1964. Though he was a shortstop by trade, he made all 79 of his appearances on the field at either second or third base.\nRuiz married Isabel Su\u00e1rez Navarro on October 4, 1961. They later had two daughters, Isis and B\u00e1rbara Isa.\n\n\n== \"The Curse of Chico Ruiz\" ==\nOn September 21, 1964, facing Art Mahaffey and the Philadelphia Phillies, Ruiz singled with one out in the sixth and the score 0\u20130. He advanced to third base on a single by Vada Pinson; however, Pinson made the second out of the inning trying to stretch it into a double. With two outs, Frank Robinson stepped to the plate.\nThough in later years Mahaffey recalled he had gotten two strikes on Robinson, newspaper accounts at the time showed, in actuality, the count was 0\u20131. Ruiz, noting Mahaffey had used a long windup on the first pitch, broke for home on the next delivery. Seeing the runner, a rattled Mahaffey rushed and uncorked a pitch which Phillies catcher Clay Dalrymple could not handle. Ruiz stole home, accounting for the only run of the game. Then and later, Ruiz's decision was viewed as a bad one, considering that Robinson\u2014Cincinnati's best hitter\u2014was up. Sabermetric analysis, however, shows that it was not a bad percentage play.\nAt the start of that game, the Phillies had a 6+1\u20442-game hold on first place with 12 games to play. The Phillies then lost ten straight games to finish tied for second place. Phillies third baseman Dick Allen is quoted in Crash, The Life and Times of Dick Allen by Tim Whitaker as saying that the play \"broke our humps\". Chico Ruiz's steal of home has evolved into a popular culture legend. Some Philadelphia sports fans still refer to the \"Curse of Chico Ruiz\" as the reason for many of the misfortunes of the team over time. A novel by Gregory T. Glading entitled 64 Intruder centers on what might have happened had Ruiz been called out on the play.\n\n\n== \"Bench me or trade me\" ==\nWith Pete Rose at second, Deron Johnson at third and Leo C\u00e1rdenas at short, Ruiz was squeezed out of a very solid infield, and saw very little playing time over the next two seasons. He took it in stride, bringing a cushion to sit on the bench, a pair of special soft, comfortable alligator spiked shoes and a battery-driven fan the people in St. Louis gave him at their games to keep himself cool and comfortable on the bench.\nHis chance finally arrived in 1967 when C\u00e1rdenas broke his finger. He performed admirably in C\u00e1rdenas' absence, batting .283 with five runs scored and four runs batted in while providing solid defense at short. This was foll\nAntonio Cipriano Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda y Francisco de Santa Ana Machado y Ruiz (26 July 1875 \u2013 22 February 1939), known as Antonio Machado, was a Spanish poet and one of the leading figures of the Spanish literary movement known as the Generation of '98. His work, initially modernist, evolved towards an intimate form of symbolism with romantic traits. He gradually developed a style characterised by both an engagement with humanity on one side and an almost Taoist contemplation of existence on the other, a synthesis that, according to Machado, echoed the most ancient popular wisdom. In Gerardo Diego's words, Machado \"spoke in verse and lived in poetry.\"\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMachado was born in Seville, Spain, one year after his brother Manuel. He was a grandson to the noted Spanish folklorist, Cipriana \u00c1lvarez Dur\u00e1n. The family moved to Madrid in 1883 and both brothers enrolled in the Instituci\u00f3n Libre de Ense\u00f1anza. During these years\u2014with the encouragement of his teachers\u2014Antonio discovered his passion for literature. While completing his Bachillerato in Madrid, economic difficulties forced him to take several jobs, including working as an actor. In 1899, he and his brother traveled to Paris to work as translators for a French publisher. During these months in Paris, he came into contact with the great French Symbolist poets Jean Mor\u00e9as, Paul Fort and Paul Verlaine, and also with other contemporary literary figures, including Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo and Oscar Wilde. These encounters cemented Machado's decision to dedicate himself to poetry.\n\nIn 1901, he had his first poems published in the literary journal 'Electra'. His first book of poetry was published in 1903, titled Soledades. Over the next few years, he gradually amended the collection, removing some and adding many more. In 1907, the definitive collection was published with the title Soledades and Galer\u00edas. Otros Poemas. In the same year, Machado was offered the job of Professor of French at the school in Soria. Here, he met Leonor Izquierdo, daughter of the owners of the boarding house Machado was staying in. They were married in 1909, he was 34 and Leonor was 15. Early in 1911, the couple went to live in Paris where Machado read more French literature and studied philosophy. In the summer however, Leonor was diagnosed with advanced tuberculosis and they returned to Spain. On 1 August 1912, Leonor died, just a few weeks after the publication of Campos de Castilla. Machado was devastated and left Soria, the city that had inspired the poetry of Campos, never to return. He went to live in Baeza, Andalusia, where he stayed until 1919. Here, he wrote a series of poems dealing with the death of Leonor which were added to a new (and now definitive) edition of Campos de Castilla published in 1916 along with the first edition of Nuevas canciones. While his earlier poems are in an ornate, Modernist style, with the publication of \"Campos de Castilla\" he showed an evolution toward greater simplicity, a characteristic that was to distinguish his poetry from then on.\nBetween 1919 and 1931, Machado was Professor of French at the Instituto de Segovia, in Segovia. He moved there to be nearer to Madrid, where Manuel lived. The brothers would meet at weekends to work together on a number of plays, the performances of which earned them great popularity. It was here also that Antonio had a secret affair with Pilar de Valderrama, a married woman with three children, to whom he would refer in his work by the name Guiomar. In 1932, he was given the post of professor at the \"Instituto Calder\u00f3n de la Barca\" in Madrid. He collaborated with Rafael Alberti and published articles in his magazine, Octubre, in 1933\u20131934.\nWhen the Spanish Civil War broke out in July 1936, Machado was in Madrid. The war was to separate him forever from his brother Manuel who was trapped in the Nationalist (Francoist) zone, and from Valderrama who was in Portugal. Machado was evacuated with his elderly mother and uncle to Valencia, and then to B\nJes\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez Ruiz (Spanish pronunciation: [xe\u02c8se ro\u02c8\u00f0\u027ei\u0263e\u03b8 \u02c8rwi\u03b8]; born 26 February 1993), known as Jes\u00e9, is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as winger or forward for Malaysia Super League club Johor Darul Ta'zim.\nAn academy graduate of La Liga side Real Madrid, Jes\u00e9 debuted for the senior team in 2011, making 94 appearances across all competitions for the club and scoring eighteen goals. During his time in Madrid, which was disrupted by a serious knee injury in 2014, he won two Champions League medals, as well as a title in each of La Liga, the FIFA Club World Cup and the Copa del Rey.\nJes\u00e9 left the club in 2016 to join Ligue 1 side Paris Saint-Germain for a reported fee of \u20ac25 million, before returning to Spain six months later to join hometown club Las Palmas on loan for the remainder of the season. Jes\u00e9 then joined Premier League side Stoke City on loan for the 2017\u201318 season, and later Real Betis for the second half of the 2018\u201319 La Liga campaign. After a brief loan spell with Primeira Liga club Sporting CP, Jes\u00e9 left PSG to rejoin Las Palmas on a permanent deal. \nOn the international stage, Jes\u00e9 earned 36 caps at youth level for Spain from under-16 to under-21 level, scoring sixteen goals overall. He was part of the Spain U19 side which won the 2012 UEFA European Under-19 Championship and claimed the Golden Boot award for ending as the tournament's top goalscorer.\nJes\u00e9 is also a musician and goes by the stage name Jey M. He was previously part of a two-man reggaeton band which was formed in March 2014 and disbanded later that year.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Real Madrid ===\n\n\n==== Early career ====\nBorn in Las Palmas, Canary Islands, Jes\u00e9 began his football career with local team Hurac\u00e1n in 2005, whom he joined from amateur side El Pilar. His form at youth level for the club saw him attract interest from La Liga sides Espanyol, Mallorca and Barcelona, but he opted to sign for Real Madrid's youth system in 2007, aged 14. Jes\u00e9 made his senior debut for the Real Madrid Castilla side on 16 January 2011 in a 5\u20130 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B home win over Universidad de Las Palmas. His performance throughout the match, which included an assist for Dani Carvajal, drew early comparisons to fellow Real Madrid teammate and multiple Ballon d'Or winner, Cristiano Ronaldo. Jes\u00e9 spent most of the season with Real Madrid's Juvenil A team, however, and enjoyed a successful 2010\u201311 campaign which earned him a permanent promotion to the Castilla side.\n\n\n==== 2011\u201313: Youth and entrance to the first team squad ====\nIn July 2011, Jes\u00e9 was selected by first-team manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho for the club's pre-season tour of the United States and made his non-competitive debut for Real Madrid in a friendly against Los Angeles Galaxy, coming on as a 64th minute substitute for Jos\u00e9 Callej\u00f3n and scoring in a 5\u20131 win. He returned to the Castilla for the start of the season and scored his first goal on 2 October 2011 against La Roda, finishing an assist from \u00c1lvaro Morata in a 4\u20132 away loss. Having impressed with the reserve side during the first half of the season, Jes\u00e9 was handed his senior debut on 12 December in the first round of the Copa del Rey, replacing Ronaldo for the final fifteen minutes of a 2\u20130 away triumph over SD Ponferradina. After the match Jes\u00e9 dedicated his debut to his family who had supported him in fulfilling his dream. He made his first La Liga appearance on 24 March 2012, once again replacing Ronaldo for the last ten minutes of a 5\u20131 home win over Real Sociedad. Aside from his two senior appearances, Jes\u00e9 made 39 appearances and scored 10 goals for Castilla as the club was crowned Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B champions. The senior side were also crowned champions of La Liga, having claimed the title with two games to spare in early May.\nThe following season, after criticism that players from the Castilla were not being given a fair chance, Mourinho stated that it was difficult to do so as the senior side played a different style to the \nMark Lerner (born September 1953) is an American businessman.
