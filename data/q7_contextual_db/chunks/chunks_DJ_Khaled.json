        "content": "Khaled Mohammed Khaled (; born November 26, 1975), known professionally as DJ Khaled, is an American DJ, record producer, and record executive. Originally a Miami-based radio personality, Khaled has since become known for enlisting high-profile music industry artists to perform on singles and albums, for which he often serves as hype man. His distinctions are his booming voice presence, \"motivational\" abstractions, and numerous catchphrases. While his musical contribution is often questioned, Khaled's role has been described as \"organization, direction, [and] promotion\".\nKhaled was born in New Orleans to Palestinian immigrant parents. He first gained recognition as a radio host in the 1990s for the radio station 99 Jamz, and translated his popularity by working with Fat Joe's hip hop collective, Terror Squad, as a DJ for their live performances. Following his production credits on the group's material, Khaled enlisted several hip hop artists associated with the group and his native Miami to perform on his debut studio album, Listennn... the Album (2006). His second album, We the Best (2007), spawned the hit single \"I'm So Hood\" (featuring T-Pain, Trick Daddy, Rick Ross and Plies). His two subsequent releases—We Global (2008) and Victory (2010)—both peaked within the top ten of the Billboard 200; the latter was supported by the single \"All I Do Is Win\" (featuring T-Pain, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg and Rick Ross), which received triple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\nHis fifth studio album and major label debut, We the Best Forever (2011), saw continued commercial success and brought Khaled to mainstream prominence by spawning his first Billboard Hot 100-top ten single, \"I'm on One\" (featuring Drake, Rick Ross and Lil Wayne). His following three albums—Kiss the Ring (2012), Suffering from Success (2013), and I Changed a Lot (2015)—were released to moderate critical and commercial reception. Throughout 2015 and 2016, Khaled gained wider recognition as a public figure due to his social media activity. This, along with several Internet memes, foresaw the release of his ninth studio album, Major Key (2016), which was met with further critical and commercial success as it debuted atop the Billboard 200 and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.\nHis tenth album, Grateful (2017), became his second consecutive number-one album and was preceded by the singles \"I'm the One\" (featuring Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper and Lil Wayne) and \"Wild Thoughts\" (featuring Rihanna and Bryson Tiller), which peaked at numbers one and two on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively. His eleventh album, Father of Asahd (2019), contained the song \"Higher\" (featuring Nipsey Hussle and John Legend), which won Best Rap/Sung Performance at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards—Khaled's first Grammy Award win. His eponymous twelfth album (2021) and thirteenth album, God Did (2022), both debuted atop the Billboard 200. The latter's title track (featuring Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Jay-Z, John Legend and Fridayy) earned three nominations at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards: Song of the Year, Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance.\nOutside of music, Khaled has gained success as a writer, with his book The Keys featuring on the New York Times Best Seller list. He has also performed as an actor for the films Spies in Disguise (2019) and Bad Boys for Life (2020). His record label, We the Best Music Group has distributed his releases since its formation in 2008, though Khaled signed other artists to the imprint including Ace Hood, Kent Jones, Mavado, Flipp Dinero, and Vado, among others.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nKhaled Mohammed Khaled was born on November 26, 1975, in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Palestinian parents who immigrated to the United States; his father was from Mazra'a ash-Sharqiya, and his mother from Ramallah. His brother Alec Ledd (Alaa Khaled) is an actor.\nHis musician parents played Arabic music; Khaled\nThe discography of American disc jockey DJ Khaled consists of thirteen studio albums which contain 54 singles (including 11 as a featured artist); his videography consists of at least 58 music videos (including 6 as a featured artist). Khaled's value proposition is his extensive network of artists of whom he enlists to perform on studio recordings. While first accumulating such connections from his work as a live DJ and radio personality, he's since become known himself for numerous quips and phrases uttered on these records—many of which became Internet memes. Furthermore, his interviews, quotes, or other presentative qualities have often been described as \"motivational\" or \"inspirational\". Despite commercial success, the albums in Khaled's discography have often garnered largely mixed receptions from music critics.\nEach released independently, Khaled released his first four albums: Listennn... the Album on June 6, 2006 (reaching number 12 on the Billboard 200), We the Best on June 12, 2007 (number eight), We Global on September 16, 2007 (number seven), and Victory on March 2, 2010 (number 14). The albums spawned Billboard Hot 100 Top 40 hits including \"I'm So Hood\" (featuring T-Pain, Trick Daddy, Rick Ross, and Plies), \"We Takin Over\" (featuring Akon, T.I., Rick Ross, Fat Joe, Birdman, and Lil Wayne), \"Out Here Grindin\" (featuring Akon, Rick Ross, Young Jeezy, Lil Boosie, Trick Daddy, Ace Hood and Plies), and \"All I Do Is Win\" (featuring T-Pain, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg, and Rick Ross).\nOn July 19, 2011, Khaled released his fifth studio album and major label debut, We the Best Forever through Cash Money Records and Young Money Entertainment, imprints of Republic Records. The album reached number five on the Billboard 200 and produced his first Billboard Hot 100 top-10 single, \"I'm on One\" (featuring Drake, Rick Ross, and Lil Wayne).\nOn August 21, 2012, Khaled released his sixth studio album, Kiss the Ring. The album reached number four on the Billboard 200. On October 22, 2013, Khaled released his seventh studio album, Suffering from Success. The album reached number seven on the Billboard 200 and produced the top-40 single, \"No New Friends\" (featuring Drake, Rick Ross, and Lil Wayne), which peaked at number 37 on the Billboard Hot 100.\nKhaled departed from the labels for an exclusive one-album contract with Sony Music and RED Distribution, releasing his eighth studio album, I Changed a Lot on October 23, 2015. The album reached number 12 on the Billboard 200 and spawned the commercial R&B single \"Hold You Down\" (featuring Chris Brown, August Alsina, Future, and Jeremih), which peaked at number 39 on the Billboard Hot 100.\nAfter gaining wider attention as an Internet meme and signing with Epic Records, Khaled released his ninth studio album, Major Key on July 29, 2016. The album debuted and peaked atop the Billboard 200, becoming his first project to do so. It produced the top-20 single, \"For Free\" (featuring Drake) which peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also produced the top-40 singles, \"I Got the Keys\" (featuring Jay-Z and Future) and \"Do You Mind\" (featuring Nicki Minaj, Chris Brown, August Alsina, Jeremih, Future, and Rick Ross); the songs reached numbers 30 and 27 on the Hot 100 respectively.\nOn June 23, 2017, Khaled released his tenth studio album, Grateful. The album became his second to peak atop the Billboard 200, and produced his first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, \"I'm the One\" (featuring Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper, and Lil Wayne). It was followed by another single, \"Wild Thoughts\" (featuring Rihanna and Bryson Tiller), which peaked at number two on the Hot 100.\nOn May 17, 2019, Khaled released his eleventh studio album, Father of Asahd. The album debuted and peaked at number two on the Billboard 200. It was preceded by two singles released a year prior: \"No Brainer\" (featuring Justin Bieber, Chance the Rapper, and Quavo), which peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100, and \"T\nKhaled Khaled (stylized in all caps) is the twelfth studio album by American disc jockey and record producer DJ Khaled.

Khaled Khaled is the first album by Khaled to be released since the birth of Aalam, his second child, on January 20, 2020. Khaled also played songs from the album to American rapper Kanye West, who came to his house days before it was released. On April 29, 2021, in an interview with Chelsea Briggs of Billboard, Khaled said that he hopes that the album will help his fans \"to be inspired, motivated, but I want them to be great\" and \"don't hold back your greatness, don't let nobody  [sic] stop the vision, but move with love\", and stated that the latter takeaway is the most important part.\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nOn July 15, 2020, Khaled announced the title of the album alongside the titles and respective song artworks for its dual lead singles, \"Popstar\" and \"Greece\", both of which feature Canadian rapper Drake, which were released two days later. Khaled had originally planned to release it sometime in the third or fourth quarter of 2020, but did not for unknown reasons. He teased most of the collaborations on the album before since he announced it. On April 27, 2021, he shared the album artwork and announced its release date. The following day, he revealed its track listing, while also teasing the ninth track from the album, \"Sorry Not Sorry\", which features American rappers Nas and Jay-Z and American singer-songwriter James Fauntleroy.

Asahd was also revealed to be acting as the album's executive producer, with his father taking to talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live! in March 2017 to explain the reasoning and process behind his son's position on the album, stating:\n\nHe is credited as executive producer, and his attorney has his points and royalties, everything. Listening to the songs, going over the business part of it, [deciding] if the vocals are right, if the beats are right, if the energy's right. When he [rocks and grins], those are smash hit records, when he [looks deep in thought], that's the real serious records but hits with substance. It's a vibe, you know what I mean? Believe it or not, the poops and the throw-ups are super blessings. Those are actually the real good ones. He actually threw up on me while I was mixing and working on \"Shining\", and when he threw up on me, that [was] a blessing.\n\n\n=== Recording and production ===\nThe album also saw production from an array of producers, including several in-house producers from Khaled's We the Best Music Group record label.

It was released on July 17, 2020, simultaneously with their other collaboration \"Greece\", as the dual lead singles from Khaled's twelfth studio album, Khaled Khaled. Both songs were produced by frequent Drake collaborator OZ. It marked the sixth and seventh collaborations between Khaled and Drake, and their first since 2017's \"To the Max\". The mid-tempo \"Popstar\" sees Drake boasting about being the \"popstar\" of the generation. The song proved to be more successful than \"Greece\", debuting at number three on the Billboard Hot 100, and number-one in Drake's native Canada.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn January 2020, Khaled flew to Drake's hometown Toronto where they spent time together in the studio. In June, he teased a Drake collaboration on his Instagram, captioning various posts with emojis of a key and owl, the mascot of Drake's OVO label. He further revealed that \"the first single been ready\" and confirmed that he was working on a new album. After fans inundated Khaled with questions on the Drake references, he said fans would have to wait a little longer for new music. In early July, Khaled confirmed that Drake was on his new album.\nOn July 15, a day before the song's release, Khaled announced his 12th studio album would be titled Khaled Khaled. He also announced two Drake collaborations would be released on July 17, \"Popstar\" and \"Greece\". DJ Khaled and Drake have collaborated various times, first in 2009 with \"Fed Up\", and during the 2010s, on \"I'm On One\", \"No New Friends\", \"For Free\" and \"To the Max\".\nProduced by OZ, he previously produced Drake's \"Toosie Slide\" and several tracks on his Dark Lane Demo Tapes mixtape.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nProducer OZ created the beat on July 23, 2019, and then used a loop by German production duo David x Eli, to take the track to \"the next level\". The reggae-tinged song contains \"moody\" production, with a hard, \"woozy\" beat. Drake's \"tight syllables\" include lyrics about vacationing in the tropical island Turks and Caicos, which he also referenced on the songs \"Omertà\" (2019) and \"Pain 1993\" (2020). He also boasts about his status as the \"popstar\" of the generation, while name-dropping Scooter Braun, Rihanna, Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez, David Foster, and Justin Bieber.  Complex's Eric Skelton said Drake's style on the song \"may have drawn inspiration\" from rappers Valee and Baby Keem. Valee's manager Andrew Barber tweeted that Drake replicated Valee's flow on his 2018 track \"Womp Womp\".\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe New York Times' Jon Caramanica called the song a \"string of ruminative tough talk\", and opined \"when he raps like this, with a stream of boastfulness, it's often an ego-clearing amuse bouche for a more ambitious release to follow\". Rolling Stone's Charles Holmes complimented the song's star quality, stating: \"It's a blunt object of a song that seems willing to forgo anything resembling subtlety\". Billboard's Michael Saponara labelled the song \"Instagram caption-friendly\", and said it oozes with \"song of the summer potential\".\n\n\n== Music video ==\nWith the announcement on the songs, Khaled posted a trailer for the song's video, co-starring Spanish actor Jordi Mollà.\nThe music video was released on Khaled's YouTube channel on September 3, 2020. The video stars fellow Canadian singer Justin Bieber, replacing Drake and Khaled due to the latter being busy. However, Drake does appear at the beginning of the video, as the video opens up with Drake showing his acting abilities as he receives countless video messages from Khaled, who asks him to appear in the video for the song. Drake, left speechless, then starts to show frustration towards Khaled's constant nagging and hassling. While in his home country of Canada, Drake then calls Bieber to appear in the video for both him and Khaled. The video also features cameos from Scooter Braun, as well as King Bach, Timothy DeLaGhetto, \nTyler Gregory Okonma (born March 6, 1991), known professionally as Tyler, the Creator, is an American rapper, record producer, director, and fashion designer. He has been cited as an influential figure in alternative hip hop during the 2010s.\nOkonma became well known in the late 2000s, when he emerged on the internet as the leader and co-founder of the music collective Odd Future. Within the group, Okonma participated as a rapper, producer, director and actor, releasing studio albums that he produced for its respective members. Okonma also performed on his sketch comedy show Loiter Squad (2012–2014).\nAlong with his collaborations with the group, Okonma developed his solo career beginning with his self-released debut album Bastard (2009). Bastard earned him recognition in the online music press as an emerging artist from the indie music scene. His second album, Goblin (2011), brought him mainstream media exposure, aided by the popularity of the single \"Yonkers\" and its accompanying music video. During this period, Okonma faced controversy in the media for his horrorcore-influenced sound and his violent, transgressive lyrical content.\nAfter the release of his third album, Wolf (2013), Okonma began to separate himself from his horrorcore productions, turning to more accessible sounds including fusions of jazz, soul and R&B. In 2015, Tyler released his fourth album, Cherry Bomb. It features artists such as Lil Wayne and Kanye West. In 2017, Okonma released Flower Boy, followed by subsequent albums Igor (2019) and Call Me If You Get Lost (2021), all of which earned him widespread critical acclaim and commercial success, with the latter two albums debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 and each winning Best Rap Album at the 2020 and 2022 Grammy Awards, respectively. His eighth studio album, Chromakopia was released on October 28, 2024.\nAside from his musical productions, Okonma became a significant figure in fashion with his clothing ventures Golf Wang and Le Fleur, and for his collaborations with major brands such as Lacoste, Converse and Louis Vuitton. Okonma is also the founder of the Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival music festival, which has been held annually since 2012, and which featured appearances by Kanye West, Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Lana Del Rey, and Billie Eilish, among others. He has also directed all of the music and promotional videos of his career, under the pseudonym Wolf Haley. Okonma has won two Grammy Awards, three BET Hip Hop Awards, a BRIT Award, and a MTV Video Music Award. In 2019, he was named \"Music Innovator of the Year\" by The Wall Street Journal. In 2024, the Los Angeles Times featured Okonma in its \"L.A. Influential\" series as a \"creator who is leaving their mark\" in Los Angeles.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nTyler Gregory Okonma was born on March 6, 1991, in Hawthorne, California, the son of a Nigerian father with Igbo ancestry, whom he never met, and an American mother of mixed African-American and white Canadian descent. He spent his early life living in Hawthorne before moving to Ladera Heights at 17. At the age of seven, he would take covers out of CD cases and create covers for his own imaginary albums—including a tracklist with song lengths—before he could even make music. At the age of 14, he taught himself to play the piano.\nIn his 12 years of schooling, he attended 12 different schools in the Los Angeles and Sacramento areas. In the eighth grade, Okonma joined a drama class and was kicked out for being too hyperactive, and in the ninth grade, he was not allowed to join the band class because he could not read music.\nHe worked at FedEx for under two weeks, and at Starbucks for over two years. Okonma took his stage name from a Myspace page he used to post his creative endeavors.\nWhen Okonma was 15, he had a YouTube channel named \"Bloxhead\". His first YouTube video was released on February 28, 2008. He posted videos until October 2009, when he stopped uploading to focus on his debut album, Bastard\nVictory is the fourth studio album by American disc jockey and record producer DJ Khaled. It was released on March 2, 2010, by We the Best Music Group and E1 Music.\n\n\n== Singles ==\nThe album's lead single, \"Fed Up\" featuring Usher, Young Jeezy, Rick Ross and Drake, was released on October 28, 2009. This song peaked at number 45 on the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip Hop songs. The album version features an extra verse from rapper Lil Wayne. On December 3, 2009, the music video was released for \"Fed Up\" featuring Usher, Young Jeezy, Rick Ross and Drake.\nThe album's second single, \"Put Your Hands Up\" featuring Schife, Young Jeezy, Rick Ross and Plies, was released on February 8, 2010. On March 2, 2010, the music video was released for \"Put Your Hands Up\" featuring Schife, Young Jeezy, Rick Ross and Plies. Plies was not featured in the music video, and his part in the song skips over to Rick Ross.\nThe album's third single, \"All I Do Is Win\" featuring T-Pain, Ludacris, Rick Ross and Snoop Dogg, was released on February 8, 2010. The song peaked at number 24 on the US Billboard Hot 100, in which it became his most successful single at the time. On March 2, 2010, the music video was released for \"All I Do Is Win\" featuring T-Pain, Ludacris, Rick Ross and Snoop Dogg. On June 28, 2010, the music video was released for the \"All I Do Is Win\" (Remix) featuring T-Pain, Diddy, Nicki Minaj, Busta Rhymes, Rick Ross, Fabolous, Jadakiss, Fat Joe and Swizz Beatz.\nUpon its release, \"On My Way\" featuring Kevin Cossom, Bali, Ace Hood, BallGreezy, Iceberg, Rum, Desloc, Triple C's member Gunplay, and Young Cash, also charted at number 16 on the US Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\n\nThe album received mixed reviews. David Jeffries of AllMusic called the album a \"fist-pumping song cycle of triumph in the hood\". He called the five-star lineup of T-Pain, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg, and Rick Ross on \"All I Do Is Win\" the gold medal track, with the Young Jeezy showcase \"Put Your Hands Up\" winning the silver. He stated Bun B's help on the song \"Rockin’ All My Chains On\" helps score the bronze, giving the track a slight edge over the hood reggae number \"Killing Me,\" which partners Busta Rhymes with Jamaican stars Buju Banton and Bounty Killer. Through intros and shout-outs, Khaled puts more of himself into this personal, story-telling album, and while this supposedly troubled effort seems complete and sound, for the most part. He disliked the closing song \"Rep My City\" saying that it \"is the least satisfying number and is best thought of as a bonus track\". In conclusion he said \"(the album) is as satisfying as his other mega-star-studded albums, with the added benefit of being more cohesive and significantly more purposeful.\nEdwin Ortiz of HipHopDX praised the single \"Fed Up\" with an all-star lineup and a catchy hook by Usher. But said the song \"On My Way\" got a bit tiring with eight different artists on the track. He also disliked the songs \"Bring the Money Out\" and \"Rockin' All My Chains On\". Talking about \"Rockin' All My Chains On\" he stated that it's almost downright unfair to put Birdman and Soulja Boy on the same song as Bun B. He applauded Nas' performance in \"Victory\".

Father of Asahd debuted behind American rapper and record producer Tyler, the Creator's fifth studio album, Igor.\nOn June 6, DJ Khaled posted a now-deleted video on his Instagram page that many believe was aimed at Tyler, the Creator after his album beat out Father of Asahd for the number one spot on the Billboard charts. In the video, Khaled stated, \"Here's the thing, I make albums so people can play it. And you actually hear it. You know, driving your car you hear another car playing it. Go to the barber shop, you hear them playing it. You know, turn the radio on, and you hear them playing it. It's playing everywhere - it's called great music. It's called albums that you actually hear the songs. Not no mysterious shit, and you never hear it.\" Many people took the \"mysterious shit\" line to be about Tyler, who responded on Twitter when a follower told him, \"Wow doin pretty good for some mysterious shit.\" Tyler told the follower, \"yeah i am, IGOR OUT NOW.\"\n\n\n== Track l\nGod Did (stylized in all caps) is the thirteenth studio album by American disc jockey and record producer DJ Khaled. It was released on August 26, 2022, by We the Best Music Group and Epic Records. The record project earned five nominations at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards, including for Best Rap Album, and Song of the Year and Best Rap Song for the title track, featuring Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Jay-Z, John Legend and Fridayy.\nThe project serves as the follow-up to his previous album, Khaled Khaled, released a year prior. It features guest appearances from Drake, Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Jay-Z, John Legend, Fridayy, Kanye West, Eminem, Future, Lil Baby, Lil Durk, 21 Savage, Roddy Ricch, Quavo, Takeoff, SZA, Nardo Wick, Kodak Black, Don Toliver, Travis Scott, Gunna, Latto, City Girls, Skillibeng, Buju Banton, Capleton, Bounty Killer, Sizzla, Jadakiss, Vory, and Juice WRLD.\nThe album sees Khaled return to a more hip-hop-oriented approach, having courted pop prestige via features from Justin Bieber and Justin Timberlake among others on his previous album. It was supported by two singles: the Drake and Lil Baby-assisted \"Staying Alive\", and the Future and Lil Baby-assisted \"Big Time\".\n\n\n== Background ==\nAccording to Khaled, the album thematizes the constant quest to relate to and praise a higher God for believing in him when others did not and he has been very open and proudly admitted to being a Muslim who habitually prays. \"God has always told me to keep going; [...] When times get hard, I go harder. When times get great, I go even harder. I don't waste my emotions and energy on moving backwards. I use my energy to find the solution to keep going. If something ain't workin' out the way it's supposed to work out, [...] I want to find a way to get back up and keep going and find the solution.\"\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nGod Did received generally mixed reviews from critics. HipHopDX called the album \"an unexpectedly, confusingly good collection of rap songs\". The magazine also praised the album as \"one of the most well constructed albums the 46-year-old record executive has ever released\". It reserved special praise for the tracks \"Party\", \"Beautiful\", \"Way Past Luck\" and \"Juice Wrld Did\". Clash called the album \"incredibly entertaining\". One critic stated: “Clocking in at a total of 57 minutes long, the new offering from the ‘I’m The One’ producer is quintessential Khaled: laid back, soulful, hard-hitting and infectious. … It’s definitely in the running for hip hop album of the year, and a standout amongst Khaled’s long-spanning discography.” In particular, Jay-Z's performance on the track \"God Did\" received critical acclaim. Simon Vozick-Levinson of Rolling Stone called the verse \"a master class in mature lyricism\", while Complex wrote that \"the long-teased verse is a reminder that he's still an exceptional writer\" and that \"this verse will definitely go down among Jay-Z's best\". An Ambrosia For Heads article called Jay-Z's verse the best verse of 2022. The project earned five nominations at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards, including for Best Rap Album, and Song of the Year and Best Rap Song for the title track.\nHowever, Clash also called the album a \"bombastic return from the hip-hop high-roller\". Dani Blum of Pitchfork described the project as a \"bogged-down album\" in which \"some of the album's most appealing melodies and hooks seem more incidental than intentional, the logical outcome of combining stars and beats, then backing away\". Blum characterized DJ Khaled as incompetent to harness \"the power of collaboration to push artists beyond their comfort zones\", with the exception of the title track with Jay-Z, which was praised as \"ambitious\". On Metacritic, based on 6 reviews, the album received a score of 43, the lowest of Khaled's career.\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nGod Did debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, earning 107,500 album-equivalent units (including 9,500 copies in pure album sales) in its first week.\n\n\"Do You Mind\" is a song by American musician DJ Khaled featuring Trinidadian musician Nicki Minaj and fellow American musicians Chris Brown, Jeremih, Future, August Alsina, and Rick Ross.

It peaked at number 7 on the Billboard 200 chart and was certified Gold by the RIAA. \nDon Cartagena introduced the rap group Terror Squad, and Terror Squad released their debut album The Album on September 21, 1999. Terror Squad artist Armageddon contributed production to the album. The album sold 250,000 units to date. Although not commercially successful, it was critically successful and was meant to be the foundation for other members to release their own albums.\n\n\n=== 2000-2005 ===\nOn February 7, 2000, Big Pun died of a heart attack, and his album Yeeeah Baby was released posthumously that year on April 4. The album debuted and peaked at number 3 on the Billboard Top 200. The album featured guest appearances from Prospect, Cuban Link, Fat Joe and Tony Sunshine. Remy Ma (then known as Remy Martin), who was Big Pun's protege, made her debut appearance on the album. In October 2017, the album was certified Platinum in America. Shortly after Big Pun's death, Triple Seis left Terror Squad Productions and parted ways with the Terror Squad group. Cuban Link would follow suit shortly thereafter after his long-awaited debut studio album that was scheduled for a summer 2000 release, 24K, was shelved due to bootlegging, problems with Atlantic Records, and issues with Fat Joe.\nOn December 4, 2001, Fat Joe released his fourth studio album Jealous Ones Still Envy (J.O.S.E.) through Terror Squad Productions. It featured the hit singles \"We Thuggin'\" and \"What's Luv\", and featured guest appearances from Armageddon (who co-executive produced the album along with Fat Joe), Prospect, and Remy Ma. The following year in 2002, Fat Joe released Loyalty. The album was a commercial disappointment, only peaking at number 31 on the Billboard 200 and failing to achieve a RIAA certification. In 2004, Terror Squad released its second and final studio album True Story through Steve Rifkind's SRC Records, Universal Records and Terror Squad Entertainment. The album peaked at number 7 on the Billboard 200. Though Prospect, Tony Sunshine, and Armageddon had made guest appearances on Fat Joe's albums and Terror Squad albums, they never released solo debut studio albums, and they all left by 2006.\nIn 2005, Fat Joe released All or Nothing. The album did better than his previous album but was still a commercial failure, and it was Fat Joe's final al\nWe the Best is the second studio album by American disc jockey and record producer DJ Khaled. It was released on June 12, 2007, by Terror Squad Entertainment and Koch Records. Khaled, alongside fellow American rapper Fat Joe, had collectively handled as the executive producers on this album. The album was produced by The Runners, Drumma Boy, Cool & Dre, J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League, Diaz Brothers, and Jim Jonsin; as well as this record features guest appearances from T-Pain, Akon, Rick Ross, Brisco, Flo Rida, Fat Joe, Cool & Dre, Juelz Santana, Jim Jones, Plies, Birdman, Lil’ Wayne, Trick Daddy, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, Trina, Paul Wall, Bun B, T.I., and Young Jeezy, among others.\nWe the Best received a mixed reception from critics, who found some of the tracks enjoyable and engaging, but felt it was over-bloated with lesser tracks and Khaled's persistent ad-libbing throughout the album. The record debuted at number eight on the US Billboard 200. As of January 2008, the album has sold 440,000 copies in the United States. It was supported by two singles: \"We Takin' Over\" (featuring T.I., Akon, Rick Ross, Fat Joe, Birdman, and Lil Wayne), and the other Rick Ross-featured track, \"I'm So Hood\", alongside T-Pain, Trick Daddy, and Plies.\n\n\n== Singles ==\nThe album's lead single, called \"We Takin' Over\" was released on April 1, 2007. The song features guest vocals from American rappers T.I., Rick Ross, Fat Joe, Birdman, and Lil Wayne, alongside the musician Akon. The song was produced by Danja.\nThe album's second single, \"I'm So Hood\" was released on August 28, 2007. The song features guests vocals from American recording artist T-Pain, alongside fellow American rappers Trick Daddy, Plies, and Rick Ross (whom recently featured on the track and its previous single, \"We Takin' Over\"). The song was produced by The Runners.\nThe album's promotional singles features two of the album's tracks—\"I'm From The Ghetto\" and \"Brown Paper Bag\"—released sometime in 2007.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\n\nWe the Best received a generally mixed reception from music critics. Steve 'Flash' Juon of RapReviews praised the album for showcasing great lyricism and production from some of the best rappers and producers working at the time but found Khaled's repeated trademark phrases annoying, concluding with: \"Other than that though this album is good - hell it's even summer banger ride in your Jeep with it 'til October good. Just don't fool yourself into thinking that Khaled had anything to do with it other than putting the right people together in the right place at the right time.\" Rolling Stone's Christian Hoard said that Khaled's beats weren't anything innovative but were used well thanks to a huge list of guest artists and tracks like \"Hit Them Up\" and \"Brown Paper Bag\" that he credited for being \"big, dumb pleasures, just begging to blast from your SUV.\" AllMusic editor David Jeffries also praised the album for collecting a lot of capable guest artists to deliver great lyricism but found some of Khaled's catchphrases and geographical jumping through his producers as the album's shortcomings, concluding that, \"Much more frustrating than a failure, We the Best earns a slight thumbs up if you think of it as a disjointed soundtrack or four-hit mixtape.\"\nAndres Tardio of HipHopDX commented on the various tracks throughout the album, saying that some of them can grab the attention of the listeners but others will feel tiring with the overabundance of guest artists and their lack of focus in the lyrics. Pitchfork contributor Tom Breihan said that after the first single, the album starts to sound rote and generic with tracks that deliver more swagger-rap and less thought-provoking substance, concluding that \"We the Best, it turns out, is indicative of one of the major problems with mainstream rap lately: too many rappers seem unwilling to drop their defenses and speak plainly.\" Nathan Slavik of DJBooth gave credit to the first two singles for having great \nAngela Brookins-Gillispie (born November 24, 1976), better known as Jacki-O, is an American singer from Miami, Florida. She signed with local record label Poe Boy Entertainment, an imprint of TVT Records to release her debut album Poe Little Rich Girl (2007), which entered the Billboard 200. Prior, she was known for her 2003 dirty rap single \"Pussy (Real Good)\" (more commonly censored as \"Nookie\"), which was followed up with her 2004 single, \"Sugar Walls.\"\nHer second studio album, The Lil Red Riding Hood (2009) was released through EMI and failed to chart. Throughout her career, Jacki-O has worked with high-profile artists including Timbaland, Busta Rhymes, T-Pain, Ghostface Killah, Ying Yang Twins and DJ Khaled. In 2014, Jacki-O retired from her recording career in favor of a career as an ordained Christian minister. Since then, she has written two books.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAngela Brookins was born on November 24, 1976, to an African-American mother and a Haitian/African-American father. She has two sisters and two brothers. Jacki-O grew up in the Pork & Beans public housing complex in the Liberty City neighborhood of Miami, Florida. She started writing poetry in middle school and freestyle rap in high school. Brookins dropped out of high school, but later earned a GED.\nBrookins started getting in trouble for stealing at a young age. As she got older, she became known for committing credit card fraud and stealing items from stores to resell at half price - which she frequently discussed in her music. \nOn December 23, 1994, Brookins gave birth to a daughter, Brittany Di'Angelis. Brookins was 18.\n\n\n== Music career ==\nIn 2002, Jacki teamed up with Poe Boy Entertainment to obtain a recording contract; in the process, she helped established the Poe Boy brand with her first mixtape, entitled The Official Bootlegg. It went on to sell over 470,000 copies and was downloaded over 250,000 times. Subsequently, she released her first music video, \"Nookie\", which became her biggest hit to date. \nIn 2008, Jacki-O revealed to Hip Hop Weekly that she was forced to have sex with a Poe Boy Entertainment executive to receive a $10,000 advance that she was previously promised. After the interview garnered negative comments, Jacki-O explained that she was not proud of what occurred, but wanted to come forward about abuse she endured in the industry. She said, \"I'm very talented and my music speaks for itself. I don't have to have sex to get to where I need to be at. The authority that I was under … I was being abused by the authority.\"\nIn 2004, Jacki-O was signed to TVT Records, whereupon she released another music video, \"Fine\", (featuring the Ying Yang Twins), as well as two more singles, \"Slow Down\" and \"Sugar Walls\". Her debut album, Poe Little Rich Girl, was released October 26, 2004, selling 90,345 in its first week.\nHer next mixtape, released four years later in 2008, was entitled Jack-Da Rippa and featured the singles \"I Got Yo Man\", \"3rd Eye\", \"Cool It Now\" and \"Queen Of The South\". This led to a recording contract with her own label imprint Jackmove Ent. the next year, where she released Lil Red Riding Hood, featuring her newest single, \"Baby Mama\", as the lead-off track. Following this, she released a mixtape entitled BBBP (Bad Bitches Bang Pink).\nIn March 2010, Jacki-O announced that she is gearing up for the release of a new street album/mixtape, titled Griselda Blanco, which she plans to release digitally. The first single released from the mixtape was entitled, 'Bang Bang,' and was a rumoured verbal attack on fellow female rapper Lil' Kim.\nIn 2014, Jacki-O announced via her official Facebook account that she transitioned from Gangsta rap to Christian hip hop due to religious commitment, stating that she has been \"touched by God\" and that she will release her next album when the timing is right. Jacki-O's net worth is $1.7 million in assets.\n\n\n== Writing ==\nJacki-O's first novel is called Grown & Gangsta (2008), described as an \"urba\n\"Love, Money, Fame\" is a song recorded by South Korean boy band Seventeen featuring American music producer DJ Khaled. It was released on October 14, 2024, as the lead single from their thirteen extended play Spill the Feels. The song debuted at number one on the Circle Digital Chart, becoming their third chart topper in South Korea.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nIn August 2024, Pledis Entertainment announced that Seventeen would be releasing a new Korean language EP in the October of that year, alongside an announcement for the Right Here World Tour. The EP Spill the Feels was announced for release on October 14. \nIn September, Seventeen members Woozi, Mingyu, and Vernon flew to Miami, US, to meet with American music producer DJ Khaled. A collaboration was teased at on October 1 and officially announced as the album's lead single on October 3.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"Love, Money, Fame\" has been described as having a groovy melody reminiscent of R&B and hip-hop, boosted by harmoniously arranged vocals. \nThe song was composed by Woozi, Bumzu, DJ Khaled, Rudi Daouk, Jakob Mihoubi, Carlyle Fernandes, Charli Taft, Daniel 'Obi' Klein, and Park Ki-tae; its lyrics were written by Woozi, Bumzu, Vernon, and Robb Roy.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video was released on October 14, concurrently with the album. It was directed by 725 of Sl8ight Visual Lab. The video features the group handling various crises such as plane crashes and armed robbery, due to having the power of love. The core message of the music video echoes lyrics of the song, which state \"everyone wants love, money, and fame, but I only want you.\"\nThe set of the music video was recreated in a partnership with Airbnb, allowing fans to immerse themselves in the video for one night.\n\n\n== Accolades ==\nDuring the song's promotional period on South Korean music programs, \"Love, Money, Fame\" achieved three first place wins.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nDigital download and streaming – Remixes\n\"Love, Money, Fame\" (featuring DJ Khaled) – 3:06\n\"Love, Money, Fame\" (English version; featuring DJ Khaled) – 3:06\n\"Love, Money, Fame\" (sped up version) – 2:29\n\"Love, Money, Fame\" (Hitchhiker Remix) – 3:03\n\"Love, Money, Fame\" (TAK Remix) – 3:03\nDigital download and streaming – Timbaland Remix\n\"Love, Money, Fame\" (featuring DJ Khaled) – 3:06\n\"Love, Money, Fame\" (Timbaland Remix; featuring DJ Khaled) – 3:13\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\"I Did It\" is a song by American record producer DJ Khaled, featuring American rappers Post Malone, Megan Thee Stallion, Lil Baby, and DaBaby. The song was serviced to US radio on June 1, 2021, as the fourth single from Khaled's twelfth studio album, Khaled Khaled. It samples \"Layla\" by Derek and the Dominos.\n\n\n== Background ==\nPrior to the album's release, DJ Khaled declared that the song would become an anthem: \"It's one of those records where, like, after a Super Bowl win, or an NBA championship, any accomplishment. The last time I felt like this was '[All I Do is Win]'\".\n\"I Did It\" samples Derek and the Dominos' 1971 single \"Layla\", in particular the guitar riff performed by Duane Allman.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nStereogum's Chris De Ville positioned it eleventh in their ranking of songs from Khaled Khaled, stating: \"In theory, an all-star posse cut with Post Malone singing over the 'Layla' guitar riff should be a slam dunk. But the hulking, sputtering beat takes all the drama out of Duane Allman's  classic riff, and the verses land like formalities. Worst of all, Posty is basically unrecognizable and unmemorable\". Variety's A.D Amorosi shared a similar sentiment: \"Even the Derek and the Dominoes' rock-out sample that kicks off the chic, aggressive 'I Did It' with an un-AutoTuned Post Malone singing out strong and full bodied (a rarity on his own records) sounds as if Khaled tailored his tone to suit the vocalist, rather than his usual other-way-around\". Clash's Robin Murray said the song \"supplies a real golden moment\", calling it a \"fiery team up\". Steve Juon of Rap Reviews criticized the sample for being \"overly familiar and easy to pick out immediately\", opining that \"a little subtlety in selection goes a long way\". Luke Fox of Exclaim! called the song \"compelling\", and said each artist \"take turns splashing quick, personality-drenched verses.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==\nCîroc is a brand of alcoholic beverages produced in France since 2003 and owned by the British-based multinational alcoholic beverage maker Diageo. The brand family includes vodka, flavored products containing vodka, and brandy.  From 2007 the marketing and promotion for Cîroc in the United States was in conjunction with mogul Sean Combs in an \"equal-share venture\" with profits from the brand being split between Combs and Diageo, but this was terminated in 2024 after a legal dispute, leaving Diageo the sole owner.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Cîroc\" is a portmanteau  of the French word cime, meaning peak or summit-top, and roche, meaning rock, a reference to the high-altitude vineyards of the Gaillac region where Mauzac grapes are grown (the 'î' in the Cîroc logo is the i-circumflex letter used in the French language.)\n\n\n== Vodka production process ==\nCîroc's vodka is distinguished from nearly all other vodkas by being derived from grapes, rather than using grain, potatoes, or maize (corn). It is distilled to a very high level of alcohol by volume (ABV) concentration –  about 96% (roughly the practical limit of ordinary distillation practices due to the ethanol and water becoming an azeotrope mixture) and is not aged or flavored before being diluted with water to 40% ABV (80 U.S. proof) for bottling, and thus fulfills the criteria for labeling as vodka (which in the United States requires at least 95% distillation concentration and 40% ABV bottling concentration for vodka).\nThe producer of Cîroc emphasizes its being distilled five times. The first four distillations use column stills and the final distillation is performed in a traditional copper pot still at the Distillerie de Chevanceaux.\n\n\n== Flavored products containing vodka ==\nSince 2010, the Cîroc brand has included a family of flavored drinks containing vodka. In the United States, these flavored beverages are bottled at 70 U.S. proof (35% ABV) –  a lower ABV level than (unflavored) vodka, although much higher than that of a typical mixed drink. In the United States, the labels of these products say \"made with vodka\" rather than simply \"vodka\", although they are referred to as vodkas on the company website.\nThe brand introduced two flavored varieties to the market in 2010: Red Berry and Coconut. In 2011, the company added a Peach flavor. In May 2013, Cîroc and Sean “Diddy” Combs announced that a new flavor would be released called Cîroc Amaretto. On 15 July 2014, Combs announced via his Instagram page that Cîroc Pineapple would be the next flavor. In 2015, he announced a green apple flavor, in 2016 DJ Khaled was signed as another brand ambassador co-promoting a new mango flavor, and in 2017 Puff Daddy announced a French vanilla flavor to be produced in partnership with hip-hop artist French Montana. As of October 2021, the U.S. brand offerings include seven main-line flavor varieties: Mango, Apple, Pineapple, Red Berry, Coconut, Peach, and French Vanilla, and four \"limited edition\" varieties: White Grape, Summer Citrus, Summer Watermelon, and Pomegranate. In April 2022 Ciroc introduce one more flavor as CÎROC PASSION.\n\n\n== Brandy ==\nCîroc VS Brandy, bottled at 80 U.S. proof (40% ABV), was added to the brand family in June 2018. It is a blend of aged French brandies, some of which is distilled in copper pot stills and aged in French oak. A review in The Spirits Business said its taste profile has \"'rich' notes of fresh fruit, vanilla and a hint of French oak\". In brandy production, \"VS\" is an abbreviation for \"very special\" and typically refers to a blend in which the youngest brandy has been aged for at least two years in a cask.\n\n\n== Background ==\nCîroc was founded in France by Jean-Sébastien Robicquet, whose family is from the wine-growing region of Bordeaux. Robicquet, whose family has been in the wine and spirits business since the early 17th century, had studied winemaking in university before moving into spirits production.
