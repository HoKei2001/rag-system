The school serves as a Visual and Performing Arts Magnet and Center for International Studies magnet for Orange County Public Schools.\nThe school's first principal, Bill Spoone, went on to be elected to the Orange County School Board. The football stadium is named after him. The school's gymnasium is named after its second principal, Larry Payne, and is nicknamed \"The House of Payne.\"\nThe school opened with enrollment above capacity and began using portable classrooms on the North Campus, formerly known as the 9th Grade Center. Due to overflow from main campus, many non-freshman classes were moved into additional portable classrooms at the 9th Grade Center, which was renamed North Campus, with the main campus renamed the South Campus. Portable classrooms are still used on the North Campus and are primarily for freshman-level classes.\nAs of the 2014–15 school year the school had 3,641 students, of whom 35% were white, 32% African American, 24% Hispanic, 7% Asian, and 2% multiracial.\nThe school underwent a series of renovations which finished in 2015. A new building has been added, along with new VPA classrooms on the South Campus.\n\n\n== Athletics ==\nThe press box at Bill Spoone Stadium is dedicated to Mike Murray, \"The Voice of the Panthers\" since the school opened its doors in 1987. A full-time employee of a large aerospace contractor and not formally employed by the school, Murray was elected to their Athletic Hall of Fame in 2001.\nThe school's baseball facility is John Barbati Field. In 1992, the baseball facilities were completely renovated with a state of the art press box, team office and facilities. The new facilities were designed and constructed by William P. Riegert, CEO of Cox Associates, Architects, and donated to the OC School Board in a dedication ceremony on February 22, 1992. Accepting for the OC School Board were Assistant Superintendent Dave Wofford, Assistant Superintendent Dave Sojourner, Superintendent Don Shaw, Bill Spoone, and Bill Thompson. Today the Press Box is dedicated to Scott Muhlhann, a baseball player and 1992 school valedictorian who died of cancer in 1998.\nThe mascot for Dr. Phillips is the Panther; specifically, the Florida panther.

He became a prominent figure in citrus farming in Central Florida and remains known in Orlando for his philanthropy.  \n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPhilip Phillips was born in Memphis, Tennessee to Henri and Isabelle Phillippe, both originally from France. Henri had come to the United States while serving in the merchant navy under Napoleon III. He spent most of his childhood in Lebanon, Tennessee.\nPhillips earned a medical degree from Columbia University in New York, for which he earned the life-long nickname \"Doc\". He first moved to Florida in 1894 with a $5,000 endowment from his father and bought a grove in Satsuma, but returned to Tennessee when the plants died off during the Great Freeze that same winter. In 1897, Phillips acquired land in Osceola County, which he used as orchards and grazing fields for cattle. In 1901, he married Della Wolf, with whom he had two sons, Howard and Walter. Phillips moved his family to a grove he purchased by Sand Lake near Orlando. Over the years, Phillips built housing and a post office for his guest workers, most from the Bahamas, developing the property into what would later become Dr. Phillips, Florida. In the 1950s, he established a town clinic for black citizens, who were otherwise restricted in accessing medical services in Florida.\nHe died in Hot Springs, Arkansas and is buried in Doctor Phillips Cemetery.\n\n\n== Career ==\nPhillips initially sold his harvest as produce before he began manufacturing fruit juice at a self-operated plant in 1928.  A citrus magnate, he owned more than 5,000 acres (20 km2) of citrus groves across nine Floridian counties in 1920 before selling his industry assets to Granada Groves and Minute Maid in 1954 in a 75%/25% split. In 1953, he established the Dr. P. Phillips Foundation, while Dr. Phillips Inc. remained in the real estate business, particularly as run by his son Howard.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nMany places and establishments are named in his honor in the Orlando, Florida area, including the community of Dr. Phillips, Florida (a suburb of Orlando), Dr. P. Phillips Baby Place at Winter Park Memorial Hospital, Orlando Health Dr. P. Phillips Hospital, The Dr. Phillips House which is now a restored Historic Inn where Dr. Phillips had lived, Dr. Phillips High School, and the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, which opened in 2014, and Dr. Phillips Academic Commons located at UCF's downtown Orlando campus.\nThe Dr. Phillips name has been a major economic and philanthropic presence in the Central Florida community for over 100 years.

You just have to assume that they're a reasonable age. I don't think we found out what his age was until we were deep in the season and then we were like, 'Oh, OK.' I assumed he was, like, 20. And the other thing I will say, when you see an actual 15-year-old boy, they're just not going to be a heartthrob.

She co-created, wrote, and starred in the mystery series The OA (2016–2019), and the thriller miniseries A Murder at the End of the World (2023).\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMarling was born on August 7, 1982, in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of property developer parents John and Heidi Marling.

It is mostly known for being the mailing address for Walt Disney World, although almost all of the resort facilities, including all four theme parks, are physically located in the adjacent city of Bay Lake. It is one of two Florida municipalities inside the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, which also contains Walt Disney World, the other being Bay Lake. The permanent residential population of Lake Buena Vista was 24 at the 2020 census.\nThe city is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area, more commonly known as Greater Orlando or the Orlando metropolitan area.\n\n\n== History ==\nChapter 67-1965 of the Laws of Florida, incorporating the City of Reedy Creek, was signed into law by Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. on May 12, 1967, the same day he also signed chapters 67-764 (creating the Reedy Creek Improvement District), also known as the Reedy Creek Improvement Act, and 67-1104 (incorporating the city of Bay Lake). It was located fully inside the Reedy Creek Improvement District. The city was controlled by Walt Disney Productions and allowed it powers that other area attractions had not had.\n\nChapter 69-1527, which became law on July 3, 1969, without the governor's approval, redefined the city boundaries. The city was completely moved, taking over some land that had been part of the City of Bay Lake (and was given up by Chapter 69-836, which became a law the same day) and including some other land that had formerly been unincorporated. Soon after, the City of Reedy Creek was renamed to the City of Lake Buena Vista to better reflect its new location, through which Reedy Creek did not flow. \"Buena Vista\" comes from the name of the street in Burbank, California, where The Walt Disney Company is headquartered.\nThe Reedy Creek Improvement District had all the powers of the city and more, raising the question of why cities needed to be incorporated inside it. Walt Disney's original plans for the site included at least one futuristic living area, a planned \"community of the future\". This was never built, but some of the ideas were incorporated into the EPCOT theme park and later Celebration, Florida. The only residents of the city are Disney employees and their immediate family members who live in a small community on Royal Oak Court, north of Disney Springs. From 1971 to 2022, the only landowners are fully owned subsidiaries of Disney, and rights-of-way for state and county roads.\nOn February 27, 2023, the Florida Legislature passed House Bill 9B to supersede the Reedy Creek Improvement Act, replacing the Reedy Creek Improvement District with the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe approximate coordinates for the City of Lake Buena Vista is located at 28°22′39″N 81°31′18″W (28.377362, –81.521728).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 3.1 square miles (8.0 km2), of which 3.0 square miles (7.7 km2) is land and 0.12 square miles (0.3 km2) (4.02%) is water.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nThe climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild winters. According to the Köppen climate classification, the City of Lake Buena Vista has a humid subtropical climate zone (Cfa).\n\n\n=== The lake ===\nLake Buena Vista is a small body of water located east of the Buena Vista Golf Course, west of the crossing of State Road 535 and Interstate 4. The lake, which was called \"Blake Lake\" before its acquisition by Disney, was named for Buena Vista Street in Burbank, California, where Disney's corporate headquarters are located. Several Walt Disney Company business entities had names containing \"Buena Vista\", a Spanish phrase that means \"good view\".\nIn 2015, guide maps for the Disney Springs shopping, dining, and entertainment district started promoting Village Lake, which the district and Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa borders, as \"Lake Buena Vista\".

Ruiz represented the United States in the 2000 Olympic Games and the 2004 Olympic Games.\n\n\n== Childhood ==\nRuiz took up diving at the age of 9. Upon a coach's suggestion, he moved to the U.S. at 12 to take advantage of the better training system.  During the spring nationals in 1999, he swept all three events (10-meter platform, 3-meter springboard and the non-Olympic event of 1-meter springboard), becoming the first diver since Greg Louganis in 1988 to accomplish this feat.\nRuiz is a graduate of Dr. Phillips High School in Orlando, Florida.  He was a member of the swimming and diving team and was the individual state champion for diving all four years he competed.\n\n\n== Competition ==\nMark's first attempt at the Olympics happened at the 1996 Trials. Ruiz also competes in synchronized diving (springboard and platform), which will have medal events for the first time in Sydney. Ruiz, a four-time national champion in the platform, has already qualified in the platform and 3-meter springboard. He and partner Rio Ramirez finished fourth in the 3-meter springboard at the 2000 World Cup. Mark retired (temporarily) after the 2004 Olympics in Greece.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter his temporary retirement from competition, Ruiz taught diving clinics at the YMCA Aquatic Center. In 2010 Mark's former team, Team Orlando Diving (TOD) affiliated with the YMCA of Central Florida and became YCF Diving.

Vivas (née Ruiz; June 21, 1953 – July 8, 2019) was a Cuban fraudster who, among other schemes, was declared the winner in the female category for the 84th Boston Marathon in 1980, only to have her title stripped eight days after the race when it was discovered that she had not run the entire course. She is believed to have jumped onto the course about a half-mile before the finish.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nRuiz was born in Havana, Cuba, and moved to Memphis, Florida, with her family in 1962 when she was eight years old. After immigrating to the United States, Ruiz was separated from her mother and lived with aunts, uncles, and cousins in Hollywood, Florida. In 1972, she graduated from South Broward High School and then attended Wayne State College in Nebraska. She graduated with a degree in music in 1977.\n\n\n== New York City Marathon ==\nShe moved to New York City in the 1970s, eventually finding work with Metal Traders, a commodities firm. In 1979, she qualified for the New York City Marathon and was credited with a time of 2:56:29, the 11th woman overall — enough for her to qualify for the Boston Marathon.\nRuiz's application for the NYC marathon arrived after the cut-off date for the race, but she received special dispensation from the New York Road Runners due to her claim that she was dying of brain cancer.\nAfter the 1980 Boston Marathon, New York City Marathon officials investigated Ruiz's run and concluded that she cheated and did not run the entire course, so on April 25, 1980, she was retroactively disqualified from the race. \nFreelance photographer Susan Morrow reported meeting her on the subway during the New York City Marathon and accompanying her from the subway to the race. She lost touch with Ruiz after that, but came forward when the news of Ruiz's dubious Boston win broke. According to Morrow, she met Ruiz on the subway and together they walked a distance to the finishing area, where Ruiz identified herself as an injured runner. She was escorted to a first aid station and volunteers marked her down as having completed the marathon, thus qualifying her for the Boston Marathon.\nNew York City Marathon officials launched an investigation and could not find any sign of Ruiz near the finish line. On April 25, based on this and other evidence, the games committee of the New York City Marathon retroactively disqualified Ruiz from the 1979 race, with marathon director Fred Lebow saying she could not possibly have run the entire course.\n\n\n== Boston Marathon ==\nOn April 21, 1980, Ruiz appeared to win the Boston Marathon's female category with a time of 2:31:56. Her time would have been the fastest female time in Boston Marathon history as well as the third-fastest female time ever recorded in any marathon. \nHowever, suspicions mounted about Ruiz almost from the beginning. Men's winner Bill Rodgers, who had just won his third straight Boston Marathon, noticed that Ruiz could not recall many things that most runners know by heart, such as intervals and splits. Other observers noticed that Ruiz was not panting or coated in sweat, and her thighs were less lean and muscular than would be expected for a world-class runner. She later released stress-test results showing her resting heart rate as 76. Most female marathoners have a resting heart rate in the 50s or lower.\nIn addition, her time of 2:31:56 was an unusual improvement, more than 25 minutes ahead of her reported time in the New York City Marathon six months earlier. When asked by a reporter why she did not seem fatigued after the grueling race, she said, \"I got up with a lot of energy this morning.\" Some female competitors thought it was odd that, when asked what she had noticed about the suburb of Wellesley while running through it, she did not mention the students of Wellesley College, who traditionally cheer loudly for the first female runners as they pass the campus. \nMost seriously, no other runners could recall seeing her.

Due to sharing the name of the Marvel character better known as Deadpool, Wilson has been referred to in the media as the \"Deadpool Killer\". Wilson was sentenced to death in 2024 after being found guilty of first-degree murder, among other charges. Prior to the murders, Wilson had a criminal history dating back to 2012, including convictions for burglary, grand theft, and firearms offenses.\n\n\n== Life and early crimes ==\nWade Steven Wilson was born on May 20, 1994 to teenage parents, and was adopted by Steve and Candace Wilson and raised in Tallahassee, Florida, where he was attending Chiles High School. During his youth, Wilson was often described as \"troubled\" and was reportedly involved in minor criminal activities and substance abuse. He also sustained several head injuries during his childhood and adolescence, which he later cited as contributing to his feelings of instability. \nHis encounters with the law began in 2012 in Leon County where he was involved in various incidents, including burglary, assault, and firearm-related offenses. In November 2013, Wilson was sentenced to prison for burglary and grand theft, serving until September 2014. In 2015, he faced charges of sexual battery and kidnapping after a woman accused him of assaulting her in his vehicle following a party. However, he was acquitted of these charges by a jury. By 2017, Wilson was incarcerated again for stealing firearms, serving until July 2018. Later in 2018, he was mentioned in connection with the case of Denise Williams, who was convicted of conspiring to murder her husband. During this time, Wilson allegedly attempted to fabricate evidence and even offered to kill Williams. In February 2019, his former girlfriend reported an incident in which he allegedly assaulted and strangled her. Although she initially accused him of kidnapping and rape, investigators did not pursue these charges due to a lack of evidence and an existing no-contact order. On July 1, 2019, Wilson was arrested again for battery.\n\n\n== Murders ==\nOn October 7, 2019, Wilson committed two murders within hours. The first victim, Kristine Melton, was strangled in her home after Wilson had met her at a live music bar. Later that day, Diane Ruiz, a mother of two and a bartender, was strangled and subsequently run over multiple times after being lured into Melton's car under false pretenses. He called his biological father, Stephen Testasecca, soon afterwards and confessed to murdering the women. Testasecca and his wife called the police and Wilson was arrested the following day. He told detectives that he would be willing to \"do it again\".\n\n\n== Legal proceedings and public reaction ==\nDuring legal proceedings, evidence of Wilson's mental health was presented, including testimony about his brain injuries. A neurologist testified that brain scans showed trauma and impairment which might explain some of Wilson's impulsive behaviors. However, experts for the prosecution argued that drug abuse was a more significant factor in his actions. The defense claimed that Wilson's drug abuse could have impaired his judgment at the time of the crime.\nWilson's father, Stephen Testasecca, testified against him in court, recounting details of his confession over the phone. Testasecca stated that his son ran over Ruiz after realizing she was not yet dead, and also could not explain his motives beyond \"I just wanted to do it.\" More than the required 8 out of the 12 jurors recommended the death penalty for Wilson (9 for the murder of Melton and 10 for the murder of Ruiz). Having the power to take or disregard the jury's suggestion, judge Nicholas Thompson imposed two death sentences. Wilson is appealing the decision to the Supreme Court of Florida.\nWilson's sentencing was marked by public interest and controversy, including numerous messages from individuals pl\nDr. Phillips High School is a public high school in Dr. Phillips, Florida, United States, near Orlando.\nIt serves the Dr. Phillips census-designated place (CDP), the Bay Hill CDP, and the residential portion of Lake Buena Vista.\n\n\n== History ==\nDr. Phillips High School opened in fall of 1987 and was built for about 2,500 students in the Dr. Phillips area of southwest Orange County, Florida.\nThe campus sits on 55 acres (220,000 m2) in the Orlando city limits and unincorporated Orange County, opposite Universal Orlando. The school serves as a Visual and Performing Arts Magnet and Center for International Studies magnet for Orange County Public Schools.\nThe school's first principal, Bill Spoone, went on to be elected to the Orange County School Board. The football stadium is named after him. The school's gymnasium is named after its second principal, Larry Payne, and is nicknamed \"The House of Payne.\"\nThe school opened with enrollment above capacity and began using portable classrooms on the North Campus, formerly known as the 9th Grade Center. Due to overflow from main campus, many non-freshman classes were moved into additional portable classrooms at the 9th Grade Center, which was renamed North Campus, with the main campus renamed the South Campus. Portable classrooms are still used on the North Campus and are primarily for freshman-level classes.\nAs of the 2014–15 school year the school had 3,641 students, of whom 35% were white, 32% African American, 24% Hispanic, 7% Asian, and 2% multiracial.\nThe school underwent a series of renovations which finished in 2015. A new building has been added, along with new VPA classrooms on the South Campus.\n\n\n== Athletics ==\nThe press box at Bill Spoone Stadium is dedicated to Mike Murray, \"The Voice of the Panthers\" since the school opened its doors in 1987. A full-time employee of a large aerospace contractor and not formally employed by the school, Murray was elected to their Athletic Hall of Fame in 2001.\nThe school's baseball facility is John Barbati Field. In 1992, the baseball facilities were completely renovated with a state of the art press box, team office and facilities. The new facilities were designed and constructed by William P. Riegert, CEO of Cox Associates, Architects, and donated to the OC School Board in a dedication ceremony on February 22, 1992. Accepting for the OC School Board were Assistant Superintendent Dave Wofford, Assistant Superintendent Dave Sojourner, Superintendent Don Shaw, Bill Spoone, and Bill Thompson. Today the Press Box is dedicated to Scott Muhlhann, a baseball player and 1992 school valedictorian who died of cancer in 1998.\nThe mascot for Dr. Phillips is the Panther; specifically, the Florida panther.

Ruiz is of Puerto Rican descent, and is the first Latino boxer to win a world heavyweight title.\n\n\n== Amateur career ==\n1991: Competed as a light heavyweight at the World Championships in Sydney, Australia.

Result was:\nLost to Jeremy Williams PTS\n\n\n== Professional career ==\n\n\n=== First reign as WBA heavyweight champion ===\nAfter Lennox Lewis defeated Evander Holyfield for the undisputed (WBA, WBC, and IBF) heavyweight title in late 1999, the WBA ordered Lewis to defend the title against mandatory challenger Ruiz, but Lewis refused. Though he had been undefeated since his 1st round 19 second loss against David Tua in 1996, the level of competition Ruiz had been facing was suspect and the only name he had beaten (to date) was a nearly 40-year-old Tony Tucker.\nRuiz and his management sued, claiming that WBA rules entitled him to a title shot. A judge agreed, but rather than face Ruiz in a bout that was seen as commercially unattractive, Lewis instead fought Michael Grant, considered to be a very worthy contender at the time, having knocked out a series of recognized \"name\" opponents on HBO. After learning of this, the judge decreed that upon entering the ring against Grant on April 29, 2000, Lewis would automatically forfeit the WBA title.\n\n\n=== Ruiz vs. Holyfield ===\n\nRuiz fought former champion Holyfield to fill the vacancy on August 12, 2000, losing by unanimous decision (this result made Holyfield the first to win a world heavyweight title on four occasions). Many observers and boxing reporters felt that the underdog Ruiz had done enough to win.\nDue to this controversial decision, the WBA ordered an immediate rematch in early 2001, and Ruiz won the WBA title. Some critics still believe the decision was controversial (Ruiz was on the ground for a few minutes after Holyfield appeared to deliver a low punch to the groin). Footage following the match showed that the punch may have been legal, but it wasn't disputed.\nRuiz defended the title twice: a controversial draw in a third match against Holyfield where the press believed Holyfield to have won, and a disqualification victory against Kirk Johnson where the Canadian contender was disqualified for repeated low blows in the tenth round. Ruiz was accused in both the second Holyfield fight and the Johnson fight of faking low blows that actually seemed to be closer to his beltline than his groin (although Johnson was shown on replays to hit Ruiz below the belt several times).\n\n\n=== Ruiz vs Jones Jr. ===\n\nOn March 1, 2003, Ruiz was contracted to fight Roy Jones Jr., who at the time was The Ring light heavyweight champion. If Jones was to beat Ruiz in the fight, he would join Bob Fitzsimmons, Michael Spinks, and Michael Moorer as the only three fighters to win titles at light heavyweight and heavyweight as well as becoming the second fighter (Fitzsimmons being the first) to win titles at both middleweight and heavyweight. Ruiz, who said referee Jay Nady \"wouldn't let me fight my fight\", lost a unanimous decision to Jones and moved back into the WBA's contender pool.\n\n\n=== Second reign as WBA heavyweight champion ===\n\nRuiz, however, would receive another shot before 2003 was out. As champion Jones was required to face the WBA's number one contender, former WBO champion Vitali Klitschko. Neither the Jones nor the Klitschko camps were able to agree to a fight by an imposed deadline, so Jones became a champion-in-recess. Klitschko, however, did not want to fight the #2 contender, former WBC, IBF, and lineal champion Hasim Rahman, for the interim championship.

When he was eighteen, he enlisted in the British Royal Navy, where he was well regarded for his knowledge of accountancy.\nThree years after enlisting in the Navy, he was invited to dine on the Victory, where he met Admiral Horatio Nelson, under whom he served for some months. This episode was widely celebrated by Mark, who wrote a book about his experiences in the service of the Admiral.\nIn 1808 he was posted as an accountant to Gibraltar, where he met Emma Bedwell, whom he married in 1810.\n\n\n== Diplomatic career ==\n\nHe was assigned to Malaga to succeed the elderly incumbent consul. Mark and his family arrived in Malaga in 1816, although he did not take up his post as consul until 1824.\nThanks to his efforts as consul to the then governor of Malaga, José Manso, he managed to obtain the concession of a burial place for the British colony in the English Cemetery of Malaga, making it the first of the Anglican Protestant cemeteries to be established in Spain.\nAlso thanks to his dealings with the Spanish authorities, he managed to rescue the body of young Robert Boyd, who had been shot on the beach of San Andrés, in Málaga, as a result of his participation in the pronunciamiento of the General José María Torrijos. Boyd's body was the second to be buried in the English Cemetery.\nHe served as consul until 1837. He was succeeded by his son, William Penrose Mark, as consul and governor of the British colony in Spain.\n\n\n== Death ==\nDied in Alhaurín el Grande, near Málaga, on 13 January 1849 and was buried in the English Cemetery in Malaga, where he has a funerary monument.\nIn 2007, the crypt where his grave is located along with seven other members of the Mark family was discovered by chance underneath the monument to his memory. In addition to William Mark's grave, the crypt also contained the graves of his wife Emma B.

Ruiz entered the adult film industry in September 2005 when she was 18 years old under the name Jenna Presley. In 2010, she was named by Maxim as one of the 12 top female stars in porn.

He was a major figure in the salsa romántica subgenre that was popular in the 1980s and early 1990s. \nDuring his youth, he developed a passion for percussion, later confessing that this would have been his second choice after singing. Fan reaction to his work was diverse. Within the Latino community, he was regarded as \"one of the best salseros ever\", and Puerto Ricans abroad were particularly fond of it because it brought back memories of their homeland. Among non-Latinos, some admitted that his music had been responsible for their interest in salsa as a genre and even the Spanish language.\nAs salsa moved closer to pop music, and toned down the eroticism in its lyrics during the 1990s, Ruiz was challenged, along with other salsa romántica performers, but he managed to record a number of hits during his late career. He suffered from years of drug and alcohol abuse. His personal shortcomings were exploited by the tabloid media but had little impact on his popularity. In 1998, Ruiz died due to complications from liver disease.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nFrankie Ruiz  was born in Paterson, New Jersey to Frank Torresola and Hilda Ruiz, a Puerto Rican couple who had moved to the city. After being born, he was initially adopted by his grandmother, Concepción, as his mother was 15 years old. Afterwards his custody passed to his parents and he was raised in Union City, along his brothers Viti and Juanito. He received his primary and secondary school education in Paterson, where his father served as education commissioner.\nAt the age of 5, Ruiz played percussion instruments at the Roberto Clemente Park in Trenton and at other city venues. One of these performances earned him an award at a show held at the Majestic Theater in Paterson. During the following years, he continued performing with the support of his parents, meeting artists like Tito Puente in the process. Despite this, Ruiz was not enrolled in formal singing classes and mostly depended on practice. During this time, he developed a friendship with Joe Salvador, through which he met Rosemary Salvador, whose family sponsored his performances and those of his brothers. Both joined a local music group led by Charlie López, known as Orquesta Nueva (otherwise known as The Charlie López Orquesta), as vocalist and bass player, and started performing salsa at talent shows. He recorded his first song \"Salsa Buena\" with this band, which was followed by \"Borinquen\".\n\n\n== Musical career ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings as a vocalist ===\nAfter their parents divorced, Hilda Torresola relocated to Mayagüez, Puerto Rico with the siblings. There they settled at Barrio Balboa to live with his grandmother, and other family members. By his early teens, Ruiz had begun performing at nightclubs. He became interested in a salsa band called La Solución, directed by Roberto Rivera, which he was able to join after multiple attempts. With this band, Ruiz re-recorded a new version of \"Salsa Buena\". As he became its lead singer and recorded the hit single titled \"La Rueda\" (\"The Wheel\"), the band was renamed Frankie Ruiz y La Solución and he toured with it for three years. Ruiz became an alcoholic and drug user following the death of his mother in a car accident and the murder of his girlfriend, an aspect of his personal life that was emphasized by the media.\nRuiz continued performing with other bands including La Dictadora and La Moderna Vibración. In 1982, Ruiz joined Tommy Olivencia and his Primerisima Orquesta, replacing Gilberto Santa Rosa as vocalist. He recorded the hit singles \"Fantasía de un capintero\" and \"Como lo hacen\", which were followed by \"Lo Dudo\", \"Primero Fui Yo\", Como Una Estrella\", and \"Que Se Mueran de Envidia\". In total, Ruiz participated in the recording of three albums with Olivencia: Un triángulo de triunfo, Tommy Olivencia and Celebrando otro aniversario. As his career centered around\nPablo Ruiz Picasso (25 October 1881 – 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist, and theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France. One of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) and the anti-war painting Guernica (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War.\nPicasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years, painting in a naturalistic manner through his childhood and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, his style changed as he experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas. After 1906, the Fauvist work of the older artist Henri Matisse motivated Picasso to explore more radical styles, beginning a fruitful rivalry between the two artists, who subsequently were often paired by critics as the leaders of modern art.\nPicasso's output, especially in his early career, is often periodized. While the names of many of his later periods are debated, the most commonly accepted periods in his work are the Blue Period (1901–1904), the Rose Period (1904–1906), the African-influenced Period (1907–1909), Analytic Cubism (1909–1912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912–1919), also referred to as the Crystal period. Much of Picasso's work of the late 1910s and early 1920s is in a neoclassical style, and his work in the mid-1920s often has characteristics of Surrealism. His later work often combines elements of his earlier styles.\nExceptionally prolific throughout the course of his long life, Picasso achieved universal renown and immense fortune for his revolutionary artistic accomplishments, and became one of the best-known figures in 20th-century art.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nPicasso was born at 23:15 on 25 October 1881, in the city of Málaga, Andalusia, in southern Spain. He was the first child of Don José Ruiz y Blasco (1838–1913) and María Picasso y López. Picasso's family was of middle-class background. His father was a painter who specialized in naturalistic depictions of birds and other game. For most of his life, Ruiz was a professor of art at the School of Crafts and a curator of a local museum.\nPicasso's birth certificate and the record of his baptism include very long names, combining those of various saints and relatives. Ruiz y Picasso were his paternal and maternal surnames, respectively, per Spanish custom. The surname \"Picasso\" comes from Liguria, a coastal region of north-western Italy. Pablo's maternal great-grandfather, Tommaso Picasso, moved to Spain around 1807.\nPicasso showed a passion and a skill for drawing from an early age. According to his mother, his first words were \"piz, piz\", a shortening of lápiz, the Spanish word for \"pencil\". From the age of seven, Picasso received formal artistic training from his father in figure drawing and oil painting. Ruiz was a traditional academic artist and instructor, who believed that proper training required disciplined copying of the masters, and drawing the human body from plaster casts and live models. His son became preoccupied with art to the detriment of his classwork.\nThe family moved to A Coruña in 1891, where his father became a professor at the School of Fine Arts. They stayed for almost four years. On one occasion, the father found his son painting over his unfinished sketch of a pigeon. Observing the precision of his son's technique, an apocryphal story relates, Ruiz felt that the thirteen-year-old Picasso had surpassed him, and vowed to give up painting, though paintings by him exist from later years.\nIn 1895, Picasso was traumatized when his seven-year-old sister, Conchita, died of diphtheria. After her death, the family moved to Barcelona, \nAnthony Joshua vs. Andy Ruiz Jr. was a heavyweight professional boxing match contested between undefeated and unified WBA (Super), IBF, WBO, and IBO champion Anthony Joshua, and former world title challenger Andy Ruiz Jr. The bout took place on June 1, 2019, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. Joshua was originally scheduled to face undefeated WBA No. 2 and WBO No. 3 ranked heavyweight Jarrell Miller, who was replaced by Ruiz Jr. after Miller failed three drug tests. \nAfter coming in as a 25–1 underdog, in a shocking upset, Ruiz Jr. won the match via technical knockout in the seventh round, ending Joshua's undefeated record and becoming the new unified heavyweight champion. Ruiz became the only American boxer to win the unified heavyweight championship since Hasim Rahman in 2001. The fight is considered one of the biggest upsets in boxing history, drawing comparisons to Mike Tyson vs. Buster Douglas in 1990 and Lennox Lewis vs. Hasim Rahman in 2001.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAndy Ruiz Jr. failed to become heavyweight champion back in December 2016, when he lost to Joseph Parker by close but somewhat debatable Majority decision. Ruiz stated how he felt like he won and wanted a rematch but the fight never took place. Meanwhile, Parker made two defenses of his WBO title until he lost to unified heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua in March 2018. Joshua since then made his next defense against Alexander Povetkin, which he stopped in the seventh round.\nJoshua had repeatedly spoken of his desire to fight the undefeated WBC champion Deontay Wilder for all four world titles, but with the American expected to fight Tyson Fury in a rematch in Las Vegas in April before the fight was cancelled, he needed an alternative opponent and insisted Dillian Whyte would then be the leading candidate. The 30-year-old Whyte called Joshua out once Derek Chisora had recovered from his 11th-round knockout, but Joshua, 29, and unusually booed by many of those present at The O2, said: “If Deontay Wilder is serious and he is going to fight Tyson Fury and doesn’t want to become undisputed champion, Dillian you will get a title shot.\"\nOn 29 December 2018, with Joshua's Wembley date still on hold, Hearn stated that Whyte was the frontrunner to challenge Joshua. Whilst still waiting for Hearn to contact him, Whyte claimed to hear rumours that Joshua would cancel the Wembley date and instead fight American contender Jarrell Miller at Madison Square Garden. On 12 January 2019, Whyte revealed that he had turned down a \"severe lowball\" offer from Joshua to fight him in a rematch. Whyte did not reveal the figure, however he claimed it was lower than what he received against Chisora in December 2018. By 21 January, Hearn stated there was a possibility Joshua would fight in the United States instead. According to Hearn, it was Joshua who was making the offer for the Whyte fight. Whyte claimed Joshua did not want to fight him, as he had known since September 2018, that he would be fighting in April 2019, yet did not make any offers. On 1 February, Hearn admitted it was becoming highly unlikely that Joshua would still fight at Wembley Stadium on 13 April. On 2 February, Whyte claimed the Joshua fight \"was dead\" and he was to look at other options, including a potential fight with Dominic Breazeale. According to Miller, Joshua initially offered Whyte $3 million, then increased the offer to $5 million, only to go down to $3.5 million.\nOn 8 February, terms were agreed for Joshua to defend his unified heavyweight titles against Miller (23-0-1, 20 KOs) on 1 June at Madison Square Garden in New York City, marking Joshua's US debut. The event became the highest grossing pre-sale in the arena's boxing history. It was reported that Joshua would pocket £19.3 million (equivalent to $25 million). Another report claimed Joshua was to earn an estimated $32 million. Miller's deal with DAZN ensured he received a career-high purse of $4.875 million, which would include two mor\nWhen Evil Lurks (Spanish: Cuando acecha la maldad) is a 2023 supernatural horror film written and directed by Demián Rugna. An international co-production of Argentina and the United States, the film stars Ezequiel Rodríguez, Demián Salomon, Luis Ziembrowski, Silvia Sabater and Marcelo Michinaux.\nWhen Evil Lurks premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) on September 16, 2023. It received a theatrical release by IFC Films on October 6, and debuted on the streaming service Shudder on October 27.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe morning after hearing gunshots in the woods near the land where they work, brothers Pedro and Jaime discover an eviscerated corpse, which leads them to a nearby shack where María Elena, an elderly woman, and her two sons, Uriel and Eduardo, are in hiding. Uriel has become a \"Rotten\", a being possessed by an unborn demon awaiting physical birth. The corpse was that of a \"Cleaner\", a professional who was to kill Uriel and exorcise the demon before it could possess others.\nThe authorities dismiss the demon as not their problem. The landowner, Ruiz, suggests removing Uriel from the shack and dumping him away from his land. After driving several hundred kilometers, the men realize that Uriel has fallen off the truck somewhere along the way. Unable to find him, Ruiz declares the matter resolved and returns home. The next morning, one of Ruiz's goats has become possessed. Ruiz's wife Jimena warns against using guns because they will only spread the infectious possession, but Ruiz shoots the animal with his shotgun. A possessed Jimena then kills Ruiz and commits suicide. That night, Eduardo knocks on Pedro and Jaime's door. Eduardo's mother disappeared after the men took Uriel, and he found Ruiz and Jimena dead. Afraid to return to his shack alone, he begs the men to let him stay the night. Pedro allows Eduardo to sleep in their shed, provided that he surrenders his pistol and promises to leave at sunrise.\nThe next morning, Jaime and Pedro plan to leave town with their families to be safe. Jaime gets their mother Sara while Pedro goes to his ex-wife Sabrina and his two children, Santino and Jair. Sabrina lives with Leonardo, her new husband. The family dog, who previously licked Pedro's demon-mucked clothes, mauls Vicky (Leonardo and Sabrina's daughter) dragging her outside. Leonardo shoots the dog despite Pedro's warning. Pedro returns to Sabrina and discovers that Vicky is back, and seemingly normal. As Pedro steals a car and drives away with his sons, a possessed Leonardo rams his truck into Sabrina and Vicky, who later dances gleefully.\nAfter Pedro picks up Jaime and Sara, the assembled family leaves town. They meet up with Mirta, a former Cleaner and Jaime's acquaintance from the city, who invites them to stay overnight. Mirta warns Jaime about Jair, who exhibits signs of possession. Jaime dismisses this as related to Jair's autism. Mirta explains that they must find and kill Uriel using the appropriate ritual to prevent the demon from being fully born. Sabrina eventually kidnaps Santino. Jaime chases after her while Mirta and Pedro take Mirta's truck to search for Uriel. Jaime reaches Sabrina only to find that she has killed Santino and is eating his brains. Furious, he runs Sabrina down and pins her to a tree. Sara stays behind to wait with Jair, who begins walking unassisted and speaking without impediment.\nPedro and Mirta's search leads to a schoolhouse filled with possessed children who killed all the nearby adults and worked to conceal Uriel. Uriel is hidden under an auditorium's stage, and Pedro tries to unearth him as Mirta sets up the exorcising ritual. Losing his patience and believing that a nearby fire axe might help dismember and move Uriel, Pedro runs to the office only to be locked in by the children. While he is occupied, the children kill Mirta and dismantle her equipment. Getting back to the auditorium too late to save Mirta, an angry Pedro beats Uriel to death. The demon is then born out\nRio Noble Ruiz (born May 22, 1994) is an American professional baseball third baseman for the Conspiradores de Querétaro of the Mexican League.

In doing so, he set the A's rookie record for stolen bases in a season, surpassing the previous record of 42 set by Mitchell Page in 1977. On July 7, the A's placed Ruiz on the 10-day injured list with a shoulder injury. He was the MLB stolen base leader at the time of the injury. In 132 games for Oakland, Ruiz hit .254/.309/.345 with 5 home runs, 47 RBI, and 67 stolen bases.

(AMD).\nRuiz is the author of Slingshot: AMD’s Fight To Free An Industry From The Ruthless Grip Of Intel, \"a book that memorializes his bet-the-company decision in 2005 to file an antitrust case against its much larger rival.\" The book also \"elaborates on his humble upbringing as well as advice and lessons learned from relatives and teachers.\"\n\n\n== Education ==\nRuiz was born in the border town of Piedras Negras, Coahuila, Mexico. As a teenager, he walked across the Mexico – United States border every day to attend a high school in nearby Eagle Pass, Texas, from which he graduated as valedictorian just three years after beginning to learn English.  Ruiz earned a BS and MS in electrical engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 1968 and 1970 respectively and a PhD from Rice University in 1973.\nIn 2012, Ruiz—along with former First Lady Laura Bush, Charles Matthews, Melinda Perrin, Julius Glickman and Admiral William H. McRaven—was named a Distinguished Alumnus of the University of Texas.\n\n\n== Career ==\nRuiz worked at Texas Instruments for six years and Motorola for 22 years, rising to become president of Motorola's Semiconductor Products Sector before being recruited in 2000 by AMD founder Jerry Sanders to serve as AMD's president and chief operating officer, and to become heir apparent to lead the company upon Sanders' retirement. Ruiz succeeded Sanders in the CEO's seat in 2002, and was named chairman of the board in 2004.\nRuiz endorsed the decision to buy ATI, which led to a period of financial reverses. Ruiz survived rumors of his ouster in late 2007. However, he resigned as CEO on July 18, 2008, after AMD reported its seventh consecutive quarterly loss.\nRuiz took AMD \"off death watch,\" according to a leading industry analyst. As CEO, Ruiz led AMD to \"important technical accomplishments and strides in its competition against Intel,\" but \" he was never able to stanch the company's persistent financial losses.\" Analyst Rob Enderle gives Ruiz credit for the strategy to spin off the manufacturing operations, \"relieving AMD of the cost of running chip plants and allowing more focus on chip design.\" Ruiz was behind the deal in which an Abu Dhabi government arm funded the new venture.\nAccording to the New York Times, \"From about 2003 to 2006, A.M.D. offered a line of chips that analysts and many computer makers hailed as superior to Intel’s products. Executives from A.M.D. contended that Intel blunted the adoption of these chips through its financial arrangements.\"\nIn 2010, the Federal Trade Commission settled a number of anti-competition complaints against Intel. Intel \"accepted all the terms of the settlement without admitting that it had committed any anticompetitive acts.\"  In 2009, AMD \"settled its own antitrust complaint against Intel in November with Intel agreeing to pay $1.25 billion.\"\nIn February 2012, the Albany Times Union looked back at the June 2006 announcement by Ruiz and then-current New York Governor George Pataki that AMD and then its spin-off GlobalFoundries \"would be building the world's most advanced 'chip fab' on the planet.\" The news \"vault[ed] the Capital Region into the global technology spotlight virtually overnight.\" Pataki said GlobalFoundries is likely to end up spending $7 billion and hiring 2,000 employees at the plant, with 9,000 additional jobs created as a result.\nRuiz was named Chairman of AMD spin-off GlobalFoundries in March 2009. He resigned concurrent with reports that identified Ruiz as the previously unnamed AMD executive who allegedly discussed AMD's plans for the spin-off with an investment manager before it had been publicly disclosed. Ruiz has not been charged with any criminal activity.  \"There were never any allegations made against me, no one from the government si\nThe murder of Vivianne Ruiz occurred in Sydney, Australia. Her body was discovered in garbage bags on 28 December 1991 without any identification. A postmortem found strangulation to be the likely cause of death. Animal hairs were found on the body, and newspaper was stuffed inside her mouth.\nOn its removal, fingerprints in what appeared to be blood were present but could not be immediately identified. Investigators spent many weeks attempting to identify the victim. A sustained and significant media campaign was also conducted. Investigators were eventually contacted by a former associate of the victim who recognised her as Vivianne Ruiz.\nInvestigators discovered Ruiz had been in a relationship with Richard White, a convicted criminal with a history of assault and drug trafficking. He had grown to know Ruiz through her work as a prostitute and dancer in the Kings Cross nightclubs in Sydney. Investigators discovered White had left Australia shortly after Ruiz was found murdered. The fingerprint found on the newspaper Ruiz's killer had left in her throat was initially considered not to belong to White. Later testing demonstrated that a tonal reverse had occurred, a rare event where the valleys between fingerprint ridges transfer blood from the grooves of the fingerprint, as opposed to its ridges.\nInvestigators eventually tracked White to England, where he was living with relatives. A warrant was sought in England for his arrest, which was eventually made in Newcastle by local detectives and Scotland Yard. White returned to Australia to face trial for the murder. After two trials were aborted due to his abnormal conduct, he was eventually found guilty in 1996 and sentenced to the maximum jail term permitted in New South Wales at the time, which was fifteen years with a minimum of nine before being eligible for parole.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe body of a female was located on the side of a suburban street in Sydney, Australia on 28 December 1991. She was wrapped in garbage bags, indicating to investigators that the victim was murdered elsewhere and transported to the location. She had suffered head injuries, and officers observed something inside her mouth that appeared at the time to be paper. A ligature was around her throat. There was no identification found on the body. Investigators described the murder as a \"frenzied attack\", and \"a callous, very brutal murder\".\n\n\n== Post-mortem ==\nA post mortem examination found the victim weighed 62 kg (137 lb) and was  1.61 m (5 ft 3 in) tall, and was estimated to be between 16 and 25 years old. The victim was found to have suffered injuries, with a wound on her head and strangulation marks on the throat. Bruises indicated she had been further injured after her death.\nNewspaper was removed from the mouth and revealed to be two full-sized sheets of the Sydney Morning Herald, dated 10 December 1991. Three distinct fingerprint patterns were identified. The fingerprints were photographed, and then enhanced with ninhydrin, an organic compound that can detect fingerprints. The practice is commonly used by forensic investigators in the analysis of latent fingerprints on porous surfaces such as paper, as the amino acids in sweat secretions that gather on a finger's unique ridges transfer to surfaces when touched. Exposure of the surface to ninhydrin converts the amino acids into visibly coloured products and thus reveals the print. Once completed, the fingerprint was fed into the police fingerprint database, though no match was found. \nA significant number of animal hairs were also found during the post-mortem. Tests showed that these were from a domestic dog, possibly a German Shepherd.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nBy the time the post-mortem was over, the body had not been identified. The victim's clothing led investigators to believe she had been local to the area.\nSeveral weeks after the body was found, and despite a strong community response, investigators were frustrated at not being able to identif\nCesar André Ruiz (born June 14, 1999) is an American professional football guard for the New Orleans Saints of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Michigan Wolverines, and was selected by the Saints in the first round of the 2020 NFL draft.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nRuiz was born to an African-American mother and a father of Puerto Rican & Dominican descent and grew up in Camden, New Jersey. Ruiz's father, Cesar Edwin Ruiz, was killed when he was struck by a motorist while helping a driver change tires when Cesar was eight years old. He attended Camden High School before transferring to IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida after his sophomore year. Ruiz was named an Under Armour All-American as a senior in 2017. Rated a four-star recruit and the top center in his class nationally, Ruiz committed to play college football at Michigan over offers from Florida, Auburn, LSU, and several other top-level programs.\n\n\n== College career ==\nRuiz played in ten games as a freshman, starting five games at right guard and long snapper with his first career start coming against Minnesota. Ruiz started all 13 of Michigan's games at center as a sophomore and was named third-team All-Big Ten Conference by the league's coaches and was an honorable mention selection by the media.\nRuiz was named to the Watchlist for the Rimington Trophy going into his junior season. Ruiz started all 13 of Michigan's games at center, allowing only eight total quarterback pressures in 447 snaps and was named the best pass blocking center in college football by Pro Football Focus, and was named second-team All-Big Ten by the coaches and third-team by the media. Following the end of the season, Ruiz announced that he had decided to forgo his senior season in order to enter the 2020 NFL draft. Over three seasons, Ruiz played in 36 games for Michigan with 31 games started.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\n\nRuiz was drafted by the New Orleans Saints in the first round with the 24th overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. Ruiz made his NFL debut on September 21, 2020, on Monday Night Football against the Las Vegas Raiders, playing on six snaps at right guard.\nIn the 2021 season opening win against the Green Bay Packers, Ruiz started the game at right guard, but played center for rest of the game after Erik McCoy suffered a calf injury in the first quarter. He continued being the team's starting center for the next four games until McCoy returned in Week 7 and Ruiz moved back to right guard.\nOn December 20, 2022, the Saints placed Ruiz on season–ending injured reserve with a foot injury. The next day, it was revealed that Ruiz had suffered a Lisfranc fracture during the team's final offensive possession in Week 15 against the Atlanta Falcons.\nOn September 9, 2023, Ruiz signed a four-year, $44 million contract extension with the Saints with $30 million guaranteed.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nNew Orleans Saints bio\nMichigan Wolverines bio\nCesar Ruiz on Twitter\nKyle Prandi (born June 19, 1979 in Cleveland, Ohio) is an American diver and Olympian from Strongsville, Ohio.

An infielder, Ruiz played in Major League Baseball for the Cincinnati Reds and California Angels from 1964 through 1971. He was the only major-league player ever to pinch-hit for Johnny Bench. He is, however, best remembered for a play he made his rookie season. His steal of home against the Philadelphia Phillies on September 21, 1964 has entered baseball folklore. Viewed by most over the years as \"mad\" or \"zany,\" the play received a revisionist defense that put it in perspective as a daring and worthwhile gamble. It is often viewed as the turning point of the Phillies late season standings collapse in 1964.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nRuiz was born in Santo Domingo, Cuba, on December 5, 1938. His father, who owned a cigar factory, wanted Giraldo to succeed him in running the business. However, Chico attended college, where he studied architecture. His brother, Julio, later headed the labor force of Cubatabaco, which absorbed the Sablón business and various other private-sector tobacco enterprises.\nRuiz signed with the Cincinnati Redlegs in 1958 at age 19. He was among the last of the Cuban players to make it out of Cuba before the borders were sealed. He batted .275 with 28 home runs over six seasons in their farm system before making the renamed Cincinnati Reds out of spring training in 1964. Though he was a shortstop by trade, he made all 79 of his appearances on the field at either second or third base.\nRuiz married Isabel Suárez Navarro on October 4, 1961. They later had two daughters, Isis and Bárbara Isa.\n\n\n== \"The Curse of Chico Ruiz\" ==\nOn September 21, 1964, facing Art Mahaffey and the Philadelphia Phillies, Ruiz singled with one out in the sixth and the score 0–0. He advanced to third base on a single by Vada Pinson; however, Pinson made the second out of the inning trying to stretch it into a double. With two outs, Frank Robinson stepped to the plate.\nThough in later years Mahaffey recalled he had gotten two strikes on Robinson, newspaper accounts at the time showed, in actuality, the count was 0–1. Ruiz, noting Mahaffey had used a long windup on the first pitch, broke for home on the next delivery. Seeing the runner, a rattled Mahaffey rushed and uncorked a pitch which Phillies catcher Clay Dalrymple could not handle. Ruiz stole home, accounting for the only run of the game. Then and later, Ruiz's decision was viewed as a bad one, considering that Robinson—Cincinnati's best hitter—was up. Sabermetric analysis, however, shows that it was not a bad percentage play.\nAt the start of that game, the Phillies had a 6+1⁄2-game hold on first place with 12 games to play. The Phillies then lost ten straight games to finish tied for second place. Phillies third baseman Dick Allen is quoted in Crash, The Life and Times of Dick Allen by Tim Whitaker as saying that the play \"broke our humps\". Chico Ruiz's steal of home has evolved into a popular culture legend. Some Philadelphia sports fans still refer to the \"Curse of Chico Ruiz\" as the reason for many of the misfortunes of the team over time. A novel by Gregory T. Glading entitled 64 Intruder centers on what might have happened had Ruiz been called out on the play.\n\n\n== \"Bench me or trade me\" ==\nWith Pete Rose at second, Deron Johnson at third and Leo Cárdenas at short, Ruiz was squeezed out of a very solid infield, and saw very little playing time over the next two seasons. He took it in stride, bringing a cushion to sit on the bench, a pair of special soft, comfortable alligator spiked shoes and a battery-driven fan the people in St. Louis gave him at their games to keep himself cool and comfortable on the bench.\nHis chance finally arrived in 1967 when Cárdenas broke his finger. He performed admirably in Cárdenas' absence, batting .283 with five runs scored and four runs batted in while providing solid defense at short. This was foll\nAntonio Cipriano José María y Francisco de Santa Ana Machado y Ruiz (26 July 1875 – 22 February 1939), known as Antonio Machado, was a Spanish poet and one of the leading figures of the Spanish literary movement known as the Generation of '98. His work, initially modernist, evolved towards an intimate form of symbolism with romantic traits. He gradually developed a style characterised by both an engagement with humanity on one side and an almost Taoist contemplation of existence on the other, a synthesis that, according to Machado, echoed the most ancient popular wisdom. In Gerardo Diego's words, Machado \"spoke in verse and lived in poetry.\"\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMachado was born in Seville, Spain, one year after his brother Manuel. He was a grandson to the noted Spanish folklorist, Cipriana Álvarez Durán. The family moved to Madrid in 1883 and both brothers enrolled in the Institución Libre de Enseñanza. During these years—with the encouragement of his teachers—Antonio discovered his passion for literature. While completing his Bachillerato in Madrid, economic difficulties forced him to take several jobs, including working as an actor. In 1899, he and his brother traveled to Paris to work as translators for a French publisher. During these months in Paris, he came into contact with the great French Symbolist poets Jean Moréas, Paul Fort and Paul Verlaine, and also with other contemporary literary figures, including Rubén Darío and Oscar Wilde. These encounters cemented Machado's decision to dedicate himself to poetry.\n\nIn 1901, he had his first poems published in the literary journal 'Electra'. His first book of poetry was published in 1903, titled Soledades. Over the next few years, he gradually amended the collection, removing some and adding many more. In 1907, the definitive collection was published with the title Soledades and Galerías. Otros Poemas. In the same year, Machado was offered the job of Professor of French at the school in Soria. Here, he met Leonor Izquierdo, daughter of the owners of the boarding house Machado was staying in. They were married in 1909, he was 34 and Leonor was 15. Early in 1911, the couple went to live in Paris where Machado read more French literature and studied philosophy. In the summer however, Leonor was diagnosed with advanced tuberculosis and they returned to Spain. On 1 August 1912, Leonor died, just a few weeks after the publication of Campos de Castilla. Machado was devastated and left Soria, the city that had inspired the poetry of Campos, never to return. He went to live in Baeza, Andalusia, where he stayed until 1919. Here, he wrote a series of poems dealing with the death of Leonor which were added to a new (and now definitive) edition of Campos de Castilla published in 1916 along with the first edition of Nuevas canciones. While his earlier poems are in an ornate, Modernist style, with the publication of \"Campos de Castilla\" he showed an evolution toward greater simplicity, a characteristic that was to distinguish his poetry from then on.\nBetween 1919 and 1931, Machado was Professor of French at the Instituto de Segovia, in Segovia. He moved there to be nearer to Madrid, where Manuel lived. The brothers would meet at weekends to work together on a number of plays, the performances of which earned them great popularity. It was here also that Antonio had a secret affair with Pilar de Valderrama, a married woman with three children, to whom he would refer in his work by the name Guiomar. In 1932, he was given the post of professor at the \"Instituto Calderón de la Barca\" in Madrid. He collaborated with Rafael Alberti and published articles in his magazine, Octubre, in 1933–1934.\nWhen the Spanish Civil War broke out in July 1936, Machado was in Madrid. The war was to separate him forever from his brother Manuel who was trapped in the Nationalist (Francoist) zone, and from Valderrama who was in Portugal. Machado was evacuated with his elderly mother and uncle to Valencia, and then to B\nJesé Rodríguez Ruiz (Spanish pronunciation: [xeˈse roˈðɾiɣeθ ˈrwiθ]; born 26 February 1993), known as Jesé, is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as winger or forward for Malaysia Super League club Johor Darul Ta'zim.\nAn academy graduate of La Liga side Real Madrid, Jesé debuted for the senior team in 2011, making 94 appearances across all competitions for the club and scoring eighteen goals. During his time in Madrid, which was disrupted by a serious knee injury in 2014, he won two Champions League medals, as well as a title in each of La Liga, the FIFA Club World Cup and the Copa del Rey.\nJesé left the club in 2016 to join Ligue 1 side Paris Saint-Germain for a reported fee of €25 million, before returning to Spain six months later to join hometown club Las Palmas on loan for the remainder of the season. Jesé then joined Premier League side Stoke City on loan for the 2017–18 season, and later Real Betis for the second half of the 2018–19 La Liga campaign. After a brief loan spell with Primeira Liga club Sporting CP, Jesé left PSG to rejoin Las Palmas on a permanent deal. \nOn the international stage, Jesé earned 36 caps at youth level for Spain from under-16 to under-21 level, scoring sixteen goals overall. He was part of the Spain U19 side which won the 2012 UEFA European Under-19 Championship and claimed the Golden Boot award for ending as the tournament's top goalscorer.\nJesé is also a musician and goes by the stage name Jey M. He was previously part of a two-man reggaeton band which was formed in March 2014 and disbanded later that year.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Real Madrid ===\n\n\n==== Early career ====\nBorn in Las Palmas, Canary Islands, Jesé began his football career with local team Huracán in 2005, whom he joined from amateur side El Pilar. His form at youth level for the club saw him attract interest from La Liga sides Espanyol, Mallorca and Barcelona, but he opted to sign for Real Madrid's youth system in 2007, aged 14. Jesé made his senior debut for the Real Madrid Castilla side on 16 January 2011 in a 5–0 Segunda División B home win over Universidad de Las Palmas. His performance throughout the match, which included an assist for Dani Carvajal, drew early comparisons to fellow Real Madrid teammate and multiple Ballon d'Or winner, Cristiano Ronaldo. Jesé spent most of the season with Real Madrid's Juvenil A team, however, and enjoyed a successful 2010–11 campaign which earned him a permanent promotion to the Castilla side.\n\n\n==== 2011–13: Youth and entrance to the first team squad ====\nIn July 2011, Jesé was selected by first-team manager José Mourinho for the club's pre-season tour of the United States and made his non-competitive debut for Real Madrid in a friendly against Los Angeles Galaxy, coming on as a 64th minute substitute for José Callejón and scoring in a 5–1 win. He returned to the Castilla for the start of the season and scored his first goal on 2 October 2011 against La Roda, finishing an assist from Álvaro Morata in a 4–2 away loss. Having impressed with the reserve side during the first half of the season, Jesé was handed his senior debut on 12 December in the first round of the Copa del Rey, replacing Ronaldo for the final fifteen minutes of a 2–0 away triumph over SD Ponferradina. After the match Jesé dedicated his debut to his family who had supported him in fulfilling his dream. He made his first La Liga appearance on 24 March 2012, once again replacing Ronaldo for the last ten minutes of a 5–1 home win over Real Sociedad. Aside from his two senior appearances, Jesé made 39 appearances and scored 10 goals for Castilla as the club was crowned Segunda División B champions. The senior side were also crowned champions of La Liga, having claimed the title with two games to spare in early May.\nThe following season, after criticism that players from the Castilla were not being given a fair chance, Mourinho stated that it was difficult to do so as the senior side played a different style to the \nMark Lerner (born September 1953) is an American businessman.

A judge agreed, but rather than face Ruiz in a bout that was seen as commercially unattractive, Lewis instead fought Michael Grant, considered to be a very worthy contender at the time, having knocked out a series of recognized \"name\" opponents on HBO.

One of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) and the anti-war painting Guernica (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War."

During the first decade of the 20th century, his style changed as he experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas. After 1906, the Fauvist work of the older artist Henri Matisse motivated Picasso to explore more radical styles, beginning a fruitful rivalry between the two artists, who subsequently were often paired by critics as the leaders of modern art."

While the names of many of his later periods are debated, the most commonly accepted periods in his work are the Blue Period (1901–1904), the Rose Period (1904–1906), the African-influenced Period (1907–1909), Analytic Cubism (1909–1912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912–1919), also referred to as the Crystal period. Much of Picasso's work of the late 1910s and early 1920s is in a neoclassical style, and his work in the mid-1920s often has characteristics of Surrealism. His later work often combines elements of his earlier styles.\nExceptionally prolific throughout the course of his long life, Picasso achieved universal renown and immense fortune for his revolutionary artistic accomplishments, and became one of the best-known figures in 20th-century art."

His father was a painter who specialized in naturalistic depictions of birds and other game. For most of his life, Ruiz was a professor of art at the School of Crafts and a curator of a local museum.\nPicasso's birth certificate and the record of his baptism include very long names, combining those of various saints and relatives. Ruiz y Picasso were his paternal and maternal surnames, respectively, per Spanish custom. The surname \"Picasso\" comes from Liguria, a coastal region of north-western Italy.

On July 7, the A's placed Ruiz on the 10-day injured list with a shoulder injury. He was the MLB stolen base leader at the time of the injury. In 132 games for Oakland, Ruiz hit .254/.309/.345 with 5 home runs, 47 RBI, and 67 stolen bases. His stolen base tally set a new AL rookie stolen base record, surpassing Kenny Lofton's 66 steals from 1992."

The practice is commonly used by forensic investigators in the analysis of latent fingerprints on porous surfaces such as paper, as the amino acids in sweat secretions that gather on a finger's unique ridges transfer to surfaces when touched. Exposure of the surface to ninhydrin converts the amino acids into visibly coloured products and thus reveals the print. Once completed, the fingerprint was fed into the police fingerprint database, though no match was found. \nA significant number of animal hairs were also found during the post-mortem.

Seeing the runner, a rattled Mahaffey rushed and uncorked a pitch which Phillies catcher Clay Dalrymple could not handle. Ruiz stole home, accounting for the only run of the game.

His work, initially modernist, evolved towards an intimate form of symbolism with romantic traits. He gradually developed a style characterised by both an engagement with humanity on one side and an almost Taoist contemplation of existence on the other, a synthesis that, according to Machado, echoed the most ancient popular wisdom. In Gerardo Diego's words, Machado \"spoke in verse and lived in poetry.\""

The family moved to Madrid in 1883 and both brothers enrolled in the Institución Libre de Enseñanza. During these years—with the encouragement of his teachers—Antonio discovered his passion for literature. While completing his Bachillerato in Madrid, economic difficulties forced him to take several jobs, including working as an actor. In 1899, he and his brother traveled to Paris to work as translators for a French publisher. During these months in Paris, he came into contact with the great French Symbolist poets Jean Moréas, Paul Fort and Paul Verlaine, and also with other contemporary literary figures, including Rubén Darío and Oscar Wilde. These encounters cemented Machado's decision to dedicate himself to poetry."

        "content": "Khaled Mohammed Khaled (; born November 26, 1975), known professionally as DJ Khaled, is an American DJ, record producer, and record executive. Originally a Miami-based radio personality, Khaled has since become known for enlisting high-profile music industry artists to perform on singles and albums, for which he often serves as hype man. His distinctions are his booming voice presence, \"motivational\" abstractions, and numerous catchphrases. While his musical contribution is often questioned, Khaled's role has been described as \"organization, direction, [and] promotion\".\nKhaled was born in New Orleans to Palestinian immigrant parents. He first gained recognition as a radio host in the 1990s for the radio station 99 Jamz, and translated his popularity by working with Fat Joe's hip hop collective, Terror Squad, as a DJ for their live performances. Following his production credits on the group's material, Khaled enlisted several hip hop artists associated with the group and his native Miami to perform on his debut studio album, Listennn... the Album (2006). His second album, We the Best (2007), spawned the hit single \"I'm So Hood\" (featuring T-Pain, Trick Daddy, Rick Ross and Plies). His two subsequent releases—We Global (2008) and Victory (2010)—both peaked within the top ten of the Billboard 200; the latter was supported by the single \"All I Do Is Win\" (featuring T-Pain, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg and Rick Ross), which received triple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\nHis fifth studio album and major label debut, We the Best Forever (2011), saw continued commercial success and brought Khaled to mainstream prominence by spawning his first Billboard Hot 100-top ten single, \"I'm on One\" (featuring Drake, Rick Ross and Lil Wayne). His following three albums—Kiss the Ring (2012), Suffering from Success (2013), and I Changed a Lot (2015)—were released to moderate critical and commercial reception. Throughout 2015 and 2016, Khaled gained wider recognition as a public figure due to his social media activity. This, along with several Internet memes, foresaw the release of his ninth studio album, Major Key (2016), which was met with further critical and commercial success as it debuted atop the Billboard 200 and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.\nHis tenth album, Grateful (2017), became his second consecutive number-one album and was preceded by the singles \"I'm the One\" (featuring Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper and Lil Wayne) and \"Wild Thoughts\" (featuring Rihanna and Bryson Tiller), which peaked at numbers one and two on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively. His eleventh album, Father of Asahd (2019), contained the song \"Higher\" (featuring Nipsey Hussle and John Legend), which won Best Rap/Sung Performance at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards—Khaled's first Grammy Award win. His eponymous twelfth album (2021) and thirteenth album, God Did (2022), both debuted atop the Billboard 200. The latter's title track (featuring Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Jay-Z, John Legend and Fridayy) earned three nominations at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards: Song of the Year, Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance.\nOutside of music, Khaled has gained success as a writer, with his book The Keys featuring on the New York Times Best Seller list. He has also performed as an actor for the films Spies in Disguise (2019) and Bad Boys for Life (2020). His record label, We the Best Music Group has distributed his releases since its formation in 2008, though Khaled signed other artists to the imprint including Ace Hood, Kent Jones, Mavado, Flipp Dinero, and Vado, among others.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nKhaled Mohammed Khaled was born on November 26, 1975, in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Palestinian parents who immigrated to the United States; his father was from Mazra'a ash-Sharqiya, and his mother from Ramallah. His brother Alec Ledd (Alaa Khaled) is an actor.\nHis musician parents played Arabic music; Khaled\nThe discography of American disc jockey DJ Khaled consists of thirteen studio albums which contain 54 singles (including 11 as a featured artist); his videography consists of at least 58 music videos (including 6 as a featured artist). Khaled's value proposition is his extensive network of artists of whom he enlists to perform on studio recordings. While first accumulating such connections from his work as a live DJ and radio personality, he's since become known himself for numerous quips and phrases uttered on these records—many of which became Internet memes. Furthermore, his interviews, quotes, or other presentative qualities have often been described as \"motivational\" or \"inspirational\". Despite commercial success, the albums in Khaled's discography have often garnered largely mixed receptions from music critics.\nEach released independently, Khaled released his first four albums: Listennn... the Album on June 6, 2006 (reaching number 12 on the Billboard 200), We the Best on June 12, 2007 (number eight), We Global on September 16, 2007 (number seven), and Victory on March 2, 2010 (number 14). The albums spawned Billboard Hot 100 Top 40 hits including \"I'm So Hood\" (featuring T-Pain, Trick Daddy, Rick Ross, and Plies), \"We Takin Over\" (featuring Akon, T.I., Rick Ross, Fat Joe, Birdman, and Lil Wayne), \"Out Here Grindin\" (featuring Akon, Rick Ross, Young Jeezy, Lil Boosie, Trick Daddy, Ace Hood and Plies), and \"All I Do Is Win\" (featuring T-Pain, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg, and Rick Ross).\nOn July 19, 2011, Khaled released his fifth studio album and major label debut, We the Best Forever through Cash Money Records and Young Money Entertainment, imprints of Republic Records. The album reached number five on the Billboard 200 and produced his first Billboard Hot 100 top-10 single, \"I'm on One\" (featuring Drake, Rick Ross, and Lil Wayne).\nOn August 21, 2012, Khaled released his sixth studio album, Kiss the Ring. The album reached number four on the Billboard 200. On October 22, 2013, Khaled released his seventh studio album, Suffering from Success. The album reached number seven on the Billboard 200 and produced the top-40 single, \"No New Friends\" (featuring Drake, Rick Ross, and Lil Wayne), which peaked at number 37 on the Billboard Hot 100.\nKhaled departed from the labels for an exclusive one-album contract with Sony Music and RED Distribution, releasing his eighth studio album, I Changed a Lot on October 23, 2015. The album reached number 12 on the Billboard 200 and spawned the commercial R&B single \"Hold You Down\" (featuring Chris Brown, August Alsina, Future, and Jeremih), which peaked at number 39 on the Billboard Hot 100.\nAfter gaining wider attention as an Internet meme and signing with Epic Records, Khaled released his ninth studio album, Major Key on July 29, 2016. The album debuted and peaked atop the Billboard 200, becoming his first project to do so. It produced the top-20 single, \"For Free\" (featuring Drake) which peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also produced the top-40 singles, \"I Got the Keys\" (featuring Jay-Z and Future) and \"Do You Mind\" (featuring Nicki Minaj, Chris Brown, August Alsina, Jeremih, Future, and Rick Ross); the songs reached numbers 30 and 27 on the Hot 100 respectively.\nOn June 23, 2017, Khaled released his tenth studio album, Grateful. The album became his second to peak atop the Billboard 200, and produced his first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, \"I'm the One\" (featuring Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper, and Lil Wayne).

Khaled also played songs from the album to American rapper Kanye West, who came to his house days before it was released. On April 29, 2021, in an interview with Chelsea Briggs of Billboard, Khaled said that he hopes that the album will help his fans \"to be inspired, motivated, but I want them to be great\" and \"don't hold back your greatness, don't let nobody  [sic] stop the vision, but move with love\", and stated that the latter takeaway is the most important part.\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nOn July 15, 2020, Khaled announced the title of the album alongside the titles and respective song artworks for its dual lead singles, \"Popstar\" and \"Greece\", both of which feature Canadian rapper Drake, which were released two days later.

It was released on July 17, 2020, simultaneously with their other collaboration \"Greece\", as the dual lead singles from Khaled's twelfth studio album, Khaled Khaled. Both songs were produced by frequent Drake collaborator OZ. It marked the sixth and seventh collaborations between Khaled and Drake, and their first since 2017's \"To the Max\". The mid-tempo \"Popstar\" sees Drake boasting about being the \"popstar\" of the generation. The song proved to be more successful than \"Greece\", debuting at number three on the Billboard Hot 100, and number-one in Drake's native Canada.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn January 2020, Khaled flew to Drake's hometown Toronto where they spent time together in the studio. In June, he teased a Drake collaboration on his Instagram, captioning various posts with emojis of a key and owl, the mascot of Drake's OVO label. He further revealed that \"the first single been ready\" and confirmed that he was working on a new album. After fans inundated Khaled with questions on the Drake references, he said fans would have to wait a little longer for new music. In early July, Khaled confirmed that Drake was on his new album.\nOn July 15, a day before the song's release, Khaled announced his 12th studio album would be titled Khaled Khaled. He also announced two Drake collaborations would be released on July 17, \"Popstar\" and \"Greece\". DJ Khaled and Drake have collaborated various times, first in 2009 with \"Fed Up\", and during the 2010s, on \"I'm On One\", \"No New Friends\", \"For Free\" and \"To the Max\".\nProduced by OZ, he previously produced Drake's \"Toosie Slide\" and several tracks on his Dark Lane Demo Tapes mixtape.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nProducer OZ created the beat on July 23, 2019, and then used a loop by German production duo David x Eli, to take the track to \"the next level\". The reggae-tinged song contains \"moody\" production, with a hard, \"woozy\" beat. Drake's \"tight syllables\" include lyrics about vacationing in the tropical island Turks and Caicos, which he also referenced on the songs \"Omertà\" (2019) and \"Pain 1993\" (2020). He also boasts about his status as the \"popstar\" of the generation, while name-dropping Scooter Braun, Rihanna, Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez, David Foster, and Justin Bieber.  Complex's Eric Skelton said Drake's style on the song \"may have drawn inspiration\" from rappers Valee and Baby Keem. Valee's manager Andrew Barber tweeted that Drake replicated Valee's flow on his 2018 track \"Womp Womp\".\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe New York Times' Jon Caramanica called the song a \"string of ruminative tough talk\", and opined \"when he raps like this, with a stream of boastfulness, it's often an ego-clearing amuse bouche for a more ambitious release to follow\". Rolling Stone's Charles Holmes complimented the song's star quality, stating: \"It's a blunt object of a song that seems willing to forgo anything resembling subtlety\". Billboard's Michael Saponara labelled the song \"Instagram caption-friendly\", and said it oozes with \"song of the summer potential\".\n\n\n== Music video ==\nWith the announcement on the songs, Khaled posted a trailer for the song's video, co-starring Spanish actor Jordi Mollà.\nThe music video was released on Khaled's YouTube channel on September 3, 2020. The video stars fellow Canadian singer Justin Bieber, replacing Drake and Khaled due to the latter being busy. However, Drake does appear at the beginning of the video, as the video opens up with Drake showing his acting abilities as he receives countless video messages from Khaled, who asks him to appear in the video for the song. Drake, left speechless, then starts to show frustration towards Khaled's constant nagging and hassling. While in his home country of Canada, Drake then calls Bieber to appear in the video for both him and Khaled. The video also features cameos from Scooter Braun, as well as King Bach, Timothy DeLaGhetto, \nTyler Gregory Okonma (born March 6, 1991), known professionally as Tyler, the Creator, is an American rapper, record producer, director, and fashion designer. He has been cited as an influential figure in alternative hip hop during the 2010s.\nOkonma became well known in the late 2000s, when he emerged on the internet as the leader and co-founder of the music collective Odd Future. Within the group, Okonma participated as a rapper, producer, director and actor, releasing studio albums that he produced for its respective members. Okonma also performed on his sketch comedy show Loiter Squad (2012–2014).\nAlong with his collaborations with the group, Okonma developed his solo career beginning with his self-released debut album Bastard (2009). Bastard earned him recognition in the online music press as an emerging artist from the indie music scene. His second album, Goblin (2011), brought him mainstream media exposure, aided by the popularity of the single \"Yonkers\" and its accompanying music video. During this period, Okonma faced controversy in the media for his horrorcore-influenced sound and his violent, transgressive lyrical content.\nAfter the release of his third album, Wolf (2013), Okonma began to separate himself from his horrorcore productions, turning to more accessible sounds including fusions of jazz, soul and R&B. In 2015, Tyler released his fourth album, Cherry Bomb. It features artists such as Lil Wayne and Kanye West. In 2017, Okonma released Flower Boy, followed by subsequent albums Igor (2019) and Call Me If You Get Lost (2021), all of which earned him widespread critical acclaim and commercial success, with the latter two albums debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 and each winning Best Rap Album at the 2020 and 2022 Grammy Awards, respectively. His eighth studio album, Chromakopia was released on October 28, 2024.\nAside from his musical productions, Okonma became a significant figure in fashion with his clothing ventures Golf Wang and Le Fleur, and for his collaborations with major brands such as Lacoste, Converse and Louis Vuitton. Okonma is also the founder of the Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival music festival, which has been held annually since 2012, and which featured appearances by Kanye West, Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Lana Del Rey, and Billie Eilish, among others. He has also directed all of the music and promotional videos of his career, under the pseudonym Wolf Haley. Okonma has won two Grammy Awards, three BET Hip Hop Awards, a BRIT Award, and a MTV Video Music Award. In 2019, he was named \"Music Innovator of the Year\" by The Wall Street Journal. In 2024, the Los Angeles Times featured Okonma in its \"L.A. Influential\" series as a \"creator who is leaving their mark\" in Los Angeles.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nTyler Gregory Okonma was born on March 6, 1991, in Hawthorne, California, the son of a Nigerian father with Igbo ancestry, whom he never met, and an American mother of mixed African-American and white Canadian descent. He spent his early life living in Hawthorne before moving to Ladera Heights at 17. At the age of seven, he would take covers out of CD cases and create covers for his own imaginary albums—including a tracklist with song lengths—before he could even make music. At the age of 14, he taught himself to play the piano.\nIn his 12 years of schooling, he attended 12 different schools in the Los Angeles and Sacramento areas. In the eighth grade, Okonma joined a drama class and was kicked out for being too hyperactive, and in the ninth grade, he was not allowed to join the band class because he could not read music.\nHe worked at FedEx for under two weeks, and at Starbucks for over two years. Okonma took his stage name from a Myspace page he used to post his creative endeavors.\nWhen Okonma was 15, he had a YouTube channel named \"Bloxhead\". His first YouTube video was released on February 28, 2008. He posted videos until October 2009, when he stopped uploading to focus on his debut album, Bastard\nVictory is the fourth studio album by American disc jockey and record producer DJ Khaled.

On March 2, 2010, the music video was released for \"Put Your Hands Up\" featuring Schife, Young Jeezy, Rick Ross and Plies. Plies was not featured in the music video, and his part in the song skips over to Rick Ross.\nThe album's third single, \"All I Do Is Win\" featuring T-Pain, Ludacris, Rick Ross and Snoop Dogg, was released on February 8, 2010. The song peaked at number 24 on the US Billboard Hot 100, in which it became his most successful single at the time.

David Jeffries of AllMusic called the album a \"fist-pumping song cycle of triumph in the hood\". He called the five-star lineup of T-Pain, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg, and Rick Ross on \"All I Do Is Win\" the gold medal track, with the Young Jeezy showcase \"Put Your Hands Up\" winning the silver. He stated Bun B's help on the song \"Rockin’ All My Chains On\" helps score the bronze, giving the track a slight edge over the hood reggae number \"Killing Me,\" which partners Busta Rhymes with Jamaican stars Buju Banton and Bounty Killer. Through intros and shout-outs, Khaled puts more of himself into this personal, story-telling album, and while this supposedly troubled effort seems complete and sound, for the most part. He disliked the closing song \"Rep My City\" saying that it \"is the least satisfying number and is best thought of as a bonus track\". In conclusion he said \"(the album) is as satisfying as his other mega-star-studded albums, with the added benefit of being more cohesive and significantly more purposeful.\nEdwin Ortiz of HipHopDX praised the single \"Fed Up\" with an all-star lineup and a catchy hook by Usher. But said the song \"On My Way\" got a bit tiring with eight different artists on the track. He also disliked the songs \"Bring the Money Out\" and \"Rockin' All My Chains On\". Talking about \"Rockin' All My Chains On\" he stated that it's almost downright unfair to put Birdman and Soulja Boy on the same song as Bun B. He applauded Nas' performance in \"Victory\". In conclusion he said that \"We may look back on DJ Khaled’s legacy in Hip Hop and see some shining moments. However, Victory as a whole product will certainly not be one of them.\"\n\n\n=== Commercial performance ===\nThe album debuted at number 14 on the US Billboard 200, number 5 on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, and number 2 on the US Top Rap Albums charts. Behind Lil Wayne's Rebirth (2010), it sold 28,000 copies in its first week.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\nNotes\n^a  signifies a co-producer\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\nFather of Asahd is the eleventh studio album by American disc jockey and record producer DJ Khaled.

Father of Asahd debuted behind American rapper and record producer Tyler, the Creator's fifth studio album, Igor.\nOn June 6, DJ Khaled posted a now-deleted video on his Instagram page that many believe was aimed at Tyler, the Creator after his album beat out Father of Asahd for the number one spot on the Billboard charts. In the video, Khaled stated, \"Here's the thing, I make albums so people can play it. And you actually hear it. You know, driving your car you hear another car playing it. Go to the barber shop, you hear them playing it. You know, turn the radio on, and you hear them playing it. It's playing everywhere - it's called great music. It's called albums that you actually hear the songs. Not no mysterious shit, and you never hear it.\" Many people took the \"mysterious shit\" line to be about Tyler, who responded on Twitter when a follower told him, \"Wow doin pretty good for some mysterious shit.\" Tyler told the follower, \"yeah i am, IGOR OUT NOW.\"\n\n\n== Track l\nGod Did (stylized in all caps) is the thirteenth studio album by American disc jockey and record producer DJ Khaled. It was released on August 26, 2022, by We the Best Music Group and Epic Records.

It was supported by two singles: the Drake and Lil Baby-assisted \"Staying Alive\", and the Future and Lil Baby-assisted \"Big Time\".\n\n\n== Background ==\nAccording to Khaled, the album thematizes the constant quest to relate to and praise a higher God for believing in him when others did not and he has been very open and proudly admitted to being a Muslim who habitually prays. \"God has always told me to keep going; [...] When times get hard, I go harder. When times get great, I go even harder. I don't waste my emotions and energy on moving backwards. I use my energy to find the solution to keep going. If something ain't workin' out the way it's supposed to work out, [...] I want to find a way to get back up and keep going and find the solution.\"\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nGod Did received generally mixed reviews from critics. HipHopDX called the album \"an unexpectedly, confusingly good collection of rap songs\". The magazine also praised the album as \"one of the most well constructed albums the 46-year-old record executive has ever released\". It reserved special praise for the tracks \"Party\", \"Beautiful\", \"Way Past Luck\" and \"Juice Wrld Did\". Clash called the album \"incredibly entertaining\". One critic stated: “Clocking in at a total of 57 minutes long, the new offering from the ‘I’m The One’ producer is quintessential Khaled: laid back, soulful, hard-hitting and infectious. … It’s definitely in the running for hip hop album of the year, and a standout amongst Khaled’s long-spanning discography.” In particular, Jay-Z's performance on the track \"God Did\" received critical acclaim. Simon Vozick-Levinson of Rolling Stone called the verse \"a master class in mature lyricism\", while Complex wrote that \"the long-teased verse is a reminder that he's still an exceptional writer\" and that \"this verse will definitely go down among Jay-Z's best\". An Ambrosia For Heads article called Jay-Z's verse the best verse of 2022. The project earned five nominations at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards, including for Best Rap Album, and Song of the Year and Best Rap Song for the title track.\nHowever, Clash also called the album a \"bombastic return from the hip-hop high-roller\". Dani Blum of Pitchfork described the project as a \"bogged-down album\" in which \"some of the album's most appealing melodies and hooks seem more incidental than intentional, the logical outcome of combining stars and beats, then backing away\". Blum characterized DJ Khaled as incompetent to harness \"the power of collaboration to push artists beyond their comfort zones\", with the exception of the title track with Jay-Z, which was praised as \"ambitious\". On Metacritic, based on 6 reviews, the album received a score of 43, the lowest of Khaled's career.\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nGod Did debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, earning 107,500 album-equivalent units (including 9,500 copies in pure album sales) in its first week.\n\n\"Do You Mind\" is a song by American musician DJ Khaled featuring Trinidadian musician Nicki Minaj and fellow American musicians Chris Brown, Jeremih, Future, August Alsina, and Rick Ross.

The label has been distributed by Atlantic, Virgin Records, and Columbia Records. The label's flagship artist was Big Pun.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early Years (1997-1999) ===\nFat Joe decided to form Terror Squad Productions in 1997 with help from Craig Kallman, Greg Angelides, and his manager Mick Bentson.\nAfter being disappointed with the previous album sales at Relativity Records, Fat Joe left Relativity and signed to Atlantic Records. After signing to Atlantic, Fat Joe was granted his own record label, Terror Squad Productions. Atlantic would allow Fat Joe to sign artists to Terror Squad. Under the terms of the deal, Fat Joe was responsible for putting their albums together and they would fund, promote and distribute the releases from the label. In addition to himself, Fat Joe also signed the rap group Terror Squad and its members Armageddon, Prospect, Triple Seis, Cuban Link, and Big Pun. The label's first release was Big Pun's debut album Capital Punishment which was released on April 28, 1998. It was executive produced by both Fat Joe and Big Pun and featured guest appearances from Prospect, Armageddon, Triple Seis, Cuban Link and Fat Joe. The album peaked at number 5 on the Billboard top 200 and was certified Platinum by the RIAA. The label's second release was Fat Joe's Don Cartagena, which was released September 1, 1998. The album was executive produced by Fat Joe and featured guest appearances from Big Pun as well as the debut official appearance of the rap group Terror Squad. It peaked at number 7 on the Billboard 200 chart and was certified Gold by the RIAA. \nDon Cartagena introduced the rap group Terror Squad, and Terror Squad released their debut album The Album on September 21, 1999. Terror Squad artist Armageddon contributed production to the album. The album sold 250,000 units to date. Although not commercially successful, it was critically successful and was meant to be the foundation for other members to release their own albums.\n\n\n=== 2000-2005 ===\nOn February 7, 2000, Big Pun died of a heart attack, and his album Yeeeah Baby was released posthumously that year on April 4. The album debuted and peaked at number 3 on the Billboard Top 200. The album featured guest appearances from Prospect, Cuban Link, Fat Joe and Tony Sunshine. Remy Ma (then known as Remy Martin), who was Big Pun's protege, made her debut appearance on the album. In October 2017, the album was certified Platinum in America. Shortly after Big Pun's death, Triple Seis left Terror Squad Productions and parted ways with the Terror Squad group. Cuban Link would follow suit shortly thereafter after his long-awaited debut studio album that was scheduled for a summer 2000 release, 24K, was shelved due to bootlegging, problems with Atlantic Records, and issues with Fat Joe.\nOn December 4, 2001, Fat Joe released his fourth studio album Jealous Ones Still Envy (J.O.S.E.) through Terror Squad Productions. It featured the hit singles \"We Thuggin'\" and \"What's Luv\", and featured guest appearances from Armageddon (who co-executive produced the album along with Fat Joe), Prospect, and Remy Ma. The following year in 2002, Fat Joe released Loyalty. The album was a commercial disappointment, only peaking at number 31 on the Billboard 200 and failing to achieve a RIAA certification. In 2004, Terror Squad released its second and final studio album True Story through Steve Rifkind's SRC Records, Universal Records and Terror Squad Entertainment. The album peaked at number 7 on the Billboard 200. Though Prospect, Tony Sunshine, and Armageddon had made guest appearances on Fat Joe's albums and Terror Squad albums, they never released solo debut studio albums, and they all left by 2006.\nIn 2005, Fat Joe released All or Nothing.

The record debuted at number eight on the US Billboard 200. As of January 2008, the album has sold 440,000 copies in the United States. It was supported by two singles: \"We Takin' Over\" (featuring T.I., Akon, Rick Ross, Fat Joe, Birdman, and Lil Wayne), and the other Rick Ross-featured track, \"I'm So Hood\", alongside T-Pain, Trick Daddy, and Plies.\n\n\n== Singles ==\nThe album's lead single, called \"We Takin' Over\" was released on April 1, 2007. The song features guest vocals from American rappers T.I., Rick Ross, Fat Joe, Birdman, and Lil Wayne, alongside the musician Akon. The song was produced by Danja.\nThe album's second single, \"I'm So Hood\" was released on August 28, 2007. The song features guests vocals from American recording artist T-Pain, alongside fellow American rappers Trick Daddy, Plies, and Rick Ross (whom recently featured on the track and its previous single, \"We Takin' Over\"). The song was produced by The Runners.\nThe album's promotional singles features two of the album's tracks—\"I'm From The Ghetto\" and \"Brown Paper Bag\"—released sometime in 2007.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\n\nWe the Best received a generally mixed reception from music critics. Steve 'Flash' Juon of RapReviews praised the album for showcasing great lyricism and production from some of the best rappers and producers working at the time but found Khaled's repeated trademark phrases annoying, concluding with: \"Other than that though this album is good - hell it's even summer banger ride in your Jeep with it 'til October good. Just don't fool yourself into thinking that Khaled had anything to do with it other than putting the right people together in the right place at the right time.\" Rolling Stone's Christian Hoard said that Khaled's beats weren't anything innovative but were used well thanks to a huge list of guest artists and tracks like \"Hit Them Up\" and \"Brown Paper Bag\" that he credited for being \"big, dumb pleasures, just begging to blast from your SUV.\" AllMusic editor David Jeffries also praised the album for collecting a lot of capable guest artists to deliver great lyricism but found some of Khaled's catchphrases and geographical jumping through his producers as the album's shortcomings, concluding that, \"Much more frustrating than a failure, We the Best earns a slight thumbs up if you think of it as a disjointed soundtrack or four-hit mixtape.\"\nAndres Tardio of HipHopDX commented on the various tracks throughout the album, saying that some of them can grab the attention of the listeners but others will feel tiring with the overabundance of guest artists and their lack of focus in the lyrics. Pitchfork contributor Tom Breihan said that after the first single, the album starts to sound rote and generic with tracks that deliver more swagger-rap and less thought-provoking substance, concluding that \"We the Best, it turns out, is indicative of one of the major problems with mainstream rap lately: too many rappers seem unwilling to drop their defenses and speak plainly.\" Nathan Slavik of DJBooth gave credit to the first two singles for having great \nAngela Brookins-Gillispie (born November 24, 1976), better known as Jacki-O, is an American singer from Miami, Florida.

After the interview garnered negative comments, Jacki-O explained that she was not proud of what occurred, but wanted to come forward about abuse she endured in the industry. She said, \"I'm very talented and my music speaks for itself. I don't have to have sex to get to where I need to be at. The authority that I was under … I was being abused by the authority.\"\nIn 2004, Jacki-O was signed to TVT Records, whereupon she released another music video, \"Fine\", (featuring the Ying Yang Twins), as well as two more singles, \"Slow Down\" and \"Sugar Walls\". Her debut album, Poe Little Rich Girl, was released October 26, 2004, selling 90,345 in its first week.\nHer next mixtape, released four years later in 2008, was entitled Jack-Da Rippa and featured the singles \"I Got Yo Man\", \"3rd Eye\", \"Cool It Now\" and \"Queen Of The South\".

The song was serviced to US radio on June 1, 2021, as the fourth single from Khaled's twelfth studio album, Khaled Khaled. It samples \"Layla\" by Derek and the Dominos.\n\n\n== Background ==\nPrior to the album's release, DJ Khaled declared that the song would become an anthem: \"It's one of those records where, like, after a Super Bowl win, or an NBA championship, any accomplishment. The last time I felt like this was '[All I Do is Win]'\".\n\"I Did It\" samples Derek and the Dominos' 1971 single \"Layla\", in particular the guitar riff performed by Duane Allman.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nStereogum's Chris De Ville positioned it eleventh in their ranking of songs from Khaled Khaled, stating: \"In theory, an all-star posse cut with Post Malone singing over the 'Layla' guitar riff should be a slam dunk. But the hulking, sputtering beat takes all the drama out of Duane Allman's  classic riff, and the verses land like formalities. Worst of all, Posty is basically unrecognizable and unmemorable\". Variety's A.D Amorosi shared a similar sentiment: \"Even the Derek and the Dominoes' rock-out sample that kicks off the chic, aggressive 'I Did It' with an un-AutoTuned Post Malone singing out strong and full bodied (a rarity on his own records) sounds as if Khaled tailored his tone to suit the vocalist, rather than his usual other-way-around\". Clash's Robin Murray said the song \"supplies a real golden moment\", calling it a \"fiery team up\". Steve Juon of Rap Reviews criticized the sample for being \"overly familiar and easy to pick out immediately\", opining that \"a little subtlety in selection goes a long way\". Luke Fox of Exclaim! called the song \"compelling\", and said each artist \"take turns splashing quick, personality-drenched verses.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==\nCîroc is a brand of alcoholic beverages produced in France since 2003 and owned by the British-based multinational alcoholic beverage maker Diageo. The brand family includes vodka, flavored products containing vodka, and brandy.  From 2007 the marketing and promotion for Cîroc in the United States was in conjunction with mogul Sean Combs in an \"equal-share venture\" with profits from the brand being split between Combs and Diageo, but this was terminated in 2024 after a legal dispute, leaving Diageo the sole owner.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Cîroc\" is a portmanteau  of the French word cime, meaning peak or summit-top, and roche, meaning rock, a reference to the high-altitude vineyards of the Gaillac region where Mauzac grapes are grown (the 'î' in the Cîroc logo is the i-circumflex letter used in the French language.)\n\n\n== Vodka production process ==\nCîroc's vodka is distinguished from nearly all other vodkas by being derived from grapes, rather than using grain, potatoes, or maize (corn). It is distilled to a very high level of alcohol by volume (ABV) concentration –  about 96% (roughly the practical limit of ordinary distillation practices due to the ethanol and water becoming an azeotrope mixture) and is not aged or flavored before being diluted with water to 40% ABV (80 U.S. proof) for bottling, and thus fulfills the criteria for labeling as vodka (which in the United States requires at least 95% distillation concentration and 40% ABV bottling concentration for vodka).\nThe producer of Cîroc emphasizes its being distilled five times. The first four distillations use column stills and the final distillation is performed in a traditional copper pot still at the Distillerie de Chevanceaux.\n\n\n== Flavored products containing vodka ==\nSince 2010, the Cîroc brand has included a family of flavored drinks containing vodka. In the United States, these flavored beverages are bottled at 70 U.S. proof (35% ABV) –  a lower ABV level than (unflavored) vodka, although much higher than that of a typical mixed drink. In the United States, the labels of these products say \"made with vodka\" rather than simply \"vodka\", although they are referred to as vodkas on the company website.\nThe brand introduced two flavored varieties to the market in 2010: Red Berry and Coconut. In 2011, the company added a Peach flavor. In May 2013, Cîroc and Sean “Diddy” Combs announced that a new flavor would be released called Cîroc Amaretto. On 15 July 2014, Combs announced via his Instagram page that Cîroc Pineapple would be the next flavor. In 2015, he announced a green apple flavor, in 2016 DJ Khaled was signed as another brand ambassador co-promoting a new mango flavor, and in 2017 Puff Daddy announced a French vanilla flavor to be produced in partnership with hip-hop artist French Montana. As of October 2021, the U.S. brand offerings include seven main-line flavor varieties: Mango, Apple, Pineapple, Red Berry, Coconut, Peach, and French Vanilla, and four \"limited edition\" varieties: White Grape, Summer Citrus, Summer Watermelon, and Pomegranate. In April 2022 Ciroc introduce one more flavor as CÎROC PASSION.\n\n\n== Brandy ==\nCîroc VS Brandy, bottled at 80 U.S. proof (40% ABV), was added to the brand family in June 2018. It is a blend of aged French brandies, some of which is distilled in copper pot stills and aged in French oak. A review in The Spirits Business said its taste profile has \"'rich' notes of fresh fruit, vanilla and a hint of French oak\". In brandy production, \"VS\" is an abbreviation for \"very special\" and typically refers to a blend in which the youngest brandy has been aged for at least two years in a cask.\n\n\n== Background ==\nCîroc was founded in France by Jean-Sébastien Robicquet, whose family is from the wine-growing region of Bordeaux. Robicquet, whose family has been in the wine and spirits business since the early 17th century, had studied winemaking in university before moving into spirits production.

But the hulking, sputtering beat takes all the drama out of Duane Allman's  classic riff, and the verses land like formalities. Worst of all, Posty is basically unrecognizable and unmemorable\". Variety's A.D Amorosi shared a similar sentiment: \"Even the Derek and the Dominoes' rock-out sample that kicks off the chic, aggressive 'I Did It' with an un-AutoTuned Post Malone singing out strong and full bodied (a rarity on his own records) sounds as if Khaled tailored his tone to suit the vocalist, rather than his usual other-way-around\".

The brand family includes vodka, flavored products containing vodka, and brandy.  From 2007 the marketing and promotion for Cîroc in the United States was in conjunction with mogul Sean Combs in an \"equal-share venture\" with profits from the brand being split between Combs and Diageo, but this was terminated in 2024 after a legal dispute, leaving Diageo the sole owner.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Cîroc\" is a portmanteau  of the French word cime, meaning peak or summit-top, and roche, meaning rock, a reference to the high-altitude vineyards of the Gaillac region where Mauzac grapes are grown (the 'î' in the Cîroc logo is the i-circumflex letter used in the French language.)"

The first four distillations use column stills and the final distillation is performed in a traditional copper pot still at the Distillerie de Chevanceaux."

It features the singles \"Top Off\" and \"No Brainer\" along with collaborations with Cardi B, 21 Savage and Meek Mill. On May 16, DJ Khaled revealed the track listing and features, as well as that the music videos for \"Higher\", \"Just Us\", \"Celebrate\", \"Jealous\" and \"Holy Mountain\" would be released throughout the day of May 17, followed by the video for \"You Stay\" on May 18, and \"Wish Wish\" and \"Weather the Storm\" on May 20. DJ Khaled scored his third career Grammy nomination with \"Higher\" which won the Best Rap/Sung Performance at the 62nd Grammy Awards.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn March 2018, DJ Khaled announced the title, upon releasing the lead single, called \"Top Off\". He named the album after his eldest child, Asahd Tuck Khaled. In March 2019, he announced the release date, while in the meantime, promoting the album extensively on his social media accounts. He also posted a trailer for the album. DJ Khaled has also teased numerous collaborations on his social media, which, along with Future, Jay-Z and Beyoncé on \"Top Off\", and Justin Bieber, Chance the Rapper and Quavo on \"No Brainer\", include J Balvin, Cardi B, Meek Mill, Post Malone, Travis Scott, Chief Keef, Bryson Tiller, Sizzla, and 2 Chainz. In April 2019, TMZ reported that \"Higher\" featuring Nipsey Hussle and John Legend would appear on the album. DJ Khaled, Nipsey Hussle, and John Legend shot the music video before Nipsey's death on March 31, 2019.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nFather of Asahd received mixed reviews among critics. On Metacritic which assigns a rating of up to 100, the album received an average of 59, indicating \"Mixed or average reviews\" based on 7 critics.\nAndy Kellman of AllMusic gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5 and also noted in his review on the album by saying \"Although instant, maximum commercial impact is no doubt the primary objective, the album does come across as more considered than the average Khaled LP.\"\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nFather of Asahd debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 with 136,000 album-equivalent units, with 34,000 copies as pure album sales in its first week. In the second week, the album remained at number two on the chart, earning an additional 58,000 album-equivalent units.

On May 17, 2020, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over 1,000,000 units in the United States.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nOn June 5, 2019, sources reported DJ Khaled was fuming at his label after Father of Asahd failed to debut at the top of the Billboard 200.  Father of Asahd debuted behind American rapper and record producer Tyler, the Creator's fifth studio album, Igor.\nOn June 6, DJ Khaled posted a now-deleted video on his Instagram page that many believe was aimed at Tyler, the Creator after his album beat out Father of Asahd for the number one spot on the Billboard charts. In the video, Khaled stated, \"Here's the thing, I make albums so people can play it. And you actually hear it. You know, driving your car you hear another car playing it. Go to the barber shop, you hear them playing it. You know, turn the radio on, and you hear them playing it. It's playing everywhere - it's called great music. It's called albums that you actually hear the songs. Not no mysterious shit, and you never hear it.\" Many people took the \"mysterious shit\" line to be about Tyler, who responded on Twitter when a follower told him, \"Wow doin pretty good for some mysterious shit.\" Tyler told the follower, \"yeah i am, IGOR OUT NOW.\"\n\n\n== Track l\nKhaled Mohammed Khaled (; born November 26, 1975), known professionally as DJ Khaled, is an American DJ, record producer, and record executive. Originally a Miami-based radio personality, Khaled has since become known for enlisting high-profile music industry artists to perform on singles and albums, for which he often serves as hype man. His distinctions are his booming voice presence, \"motivational\" abstractions, and numerous catchphrases. While his musical contribution is often questioned, Khaled's role has been described as \"organization, direction, [and] promotion\".\nKhaled was born in New Orleans to Palestinian immigrant parents. He first gained recognition as a radio host in the 1990s for the radio station 99 Jamz, and translated his popularity by working with Fat Joe's hip hop collective, Terror Squad, as a DJ for their live performances. Following his production credits on the group's material, Khaled enlisted several hip hop artists associated with the group and his native Miami to perform on his debut studio album, Listennn... the Album (2006). His second album, We the Best (2007), spawned the hit single \"I'm So Hood\" (featuring T-Pain, Trick Daddy, Rick Ross and Plies). His two subsequent releases—We Global (2008) and Victory (2010)—both peaked within the top ten of the Billboard 200; the latter was supported by the single \"All I Do Is Win\" (featuring T-Pain, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg and Rick Ross), which received triple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\nHis fifth studio album and major label debut, We the Best Forever (2011), saw continued commercial success and brought Khaled to mainstream prominence by spawning his first Billboard Hot 100-top ten single, \"I'm on One\" (featuring Drake, Rick Ross and Lil Wayne). His following three albums—Kiss the Ring (2012), Suffering from Success (2013), and I Changed a Lot (2015)—were released to moderate critical and commercial reception. Throughout 2015 and 2016, Khaled gained wider recognition as a public figure due to his social media activity. This, along with several Internet memes, foresaw the release of his ninth studio album, Major Key (2016), which was met with further critical and commercial success as it debuted atop the Billboard 200 and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.\nHis tenth album, Grateful (2017), became his second consecutive number-one album and was preceded by the singles \"I'm the One\" (featuring Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper and Lil Wayne) and \"Wild Thoughts\" (featuring Rihanna and Bryson Tiller), which peaked at numbers one and two on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively. His eleventh album, Father of Asahd (2019), contained the song \"Higher\" (featuring Nipsey Hussle and John Legend), which won Best Rap/Sung Performance at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards—Khaled's first Grammy Award win. His eponymous twelfth album (2021) and thirteenth album, God Did (2022), both debuted atop the Billboard 200. The latter's title track (featuring Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Jay-Z, John Legend and Fridayy) earned three nominations at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards: Song of the Year, Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance.\nOutside of music, Khaled has gained success as a writer, with his book The Keys featuring on the New York Times Best Seller list. He has also performed as an actor for the films Spies in Disguise (2019) and Bad Boys for Life (2020). His record label, We the Best Music Group has distributed his releases since its formation in 2008, though Khaled signed other artists to the imprint including Ace Hood, Kent Jones, Mavado, Flipp Dinero, and Vado, among others.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nKhaled Mohammed Khaled was born on November 26, 1975, in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Palestinian parents who immigrated to the United States; his father was from Mazra'a ash-Sharqiya, and his mother from Ramallah. His brother Alec Ledd (Alaa Khaled) is an actor.\nHis musician parents played Arabic music; Khaled\nDanielle Balbuena (born June 13, 1997), known professionally as 070 Shake (pronounced \"oh seven oh shake\"), is an American rapper and singer. She is best known for her guest appearance on English singer Raye's 2022 single \"Escapism\", which peaked at number 22 on the Billboard Hot 100, peaked atop the UK Singles Chart, and won Song of the Year at the 2024 Brit Awards.\nPreviously, she signed with rapper Kanye West's record label, GOOD Music, an imprint of Def Jam Recordings, in 2016. Her debut extended play (EP), Glitter (2018), foresaw her receiving further attention in June of that year for her guest appearances on West's songs \"Ghost Town\" and \"Violent Crimes\"—from his eighth album, Ye—both of which peaked within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart. During that same month, Balbuena also guest performed on labelmate Pusha T's album Daytona and New York rapper Nas' album Nasir. Her debut studio album, Modus Vivendi (2020), and its follow-up, You Can't Kill Me (2022), were both positively received by music critics despite failing to chart.\nAside from her solo career, Balbuena is also a member of the New Jersey–based musical collective 070, from which she adapted her stage name. The group has released one mixtape, The 070 Project: Chapter 1 (2016).\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBalbuena was born in North Bergen, New Jersey, and is of Dominican descent. Balbuena attended North Bergen High School, where she played on the school's basketball team. Prior to her music career, Balbuena wrote poetry.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2015–2016: Early years ===\nShake began her music career in late 2015, recording the songs \"Proud\" and \"Swervin\". Shake's stage name is derived from her affiliation with the 070 music collective with 070 coming from New Jersey's 070 ZIP Codes. By 2018, the 070 crew was noted to have 11 members, including artists and producers.\nBy 2016, Shake was earning hundreds of thousands of streams on SoundCloud. Soon after posting several songs on SoundCloud, Shake attracted the attention of Miami-based promoter and social media personality YesJulz. After hearing \"Proud\" specifically, YesJulz reached out to Shake on Twitter, quickly signing on to be her manager. Shake broke through with \"Trust Nobody\", released early in that year. In August, Shake collaborated with fellow 070 members Ralphy River, Hack, and Treee Safari on the single \"Honey\". The song featured production from frequent collaborators, The Kompetition, a three-person production group. \"Honey\" simultaneously premiered on Complex and 1 AM Radio on Dash. Vibe commented that the track \"[sounded] tailor–made to rock on dance floors everywhere.\"\nAlso in 2016, Shake signed with Kanye West's GOOD Music label. GOOD Music found out about Shake through Julz, as she played some of Shake's music at a Yeezy fitting, interesting the label's president, Pusha T. After signing Shake, the label picked up her \"Trust Nobody\" track and re-released it in September. Shake spent October and November opening up for English rock band The 1975 during the American leg of their 2016 tour. On December 8, 070 released their first mixtape, The 070 Project: Chapter 1.\n\n\n=== Since 2017: Glitter, Modus Vivendi and You Can't Kill Me ===\nShake modeled for Gypsy Sport's Fall 2017 runway show. She also went on her first headlining tour in April. In a 2017 interview with Paper, Shake mentioned her Yellow Girl EP would release later that year. However, the project was moved back to release after Glitter, another collaboration with The Kompetition.\nHer solo debut, the 6-track EP Glitter, was released on March 23, 2018, although it was originally slated for a January 26 release and to include 12 tracks. At the time of Glitter's release, media outlets noted that her lyrical content concentrated on her self-esteem issues, drug use, and sexuality. Shake described Glitter as \"about being in a dark place and finding yourself and figuring it out. It's about being in the lowest of lows type of shit.\" Shortly p\n\"Just Us\" is a song by American producer DJ Khaled featuring R&B singer SZA from Khaled's 2019 album Father of Asahd. It was serviced to contemporary hit radio on May 21, 2019, as the fourth single off the album. The song samples Outkast's \"Ms. Jackson\".\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThomas Hobbs of NME praised SZA's performance on the song and described it as \"mixtape freestyle\". A.D. Amorosi of Variety called the track \"simmering\" and stated that the song sounds out of place on a DJ Khaled album.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nOn April 15, 2019, Khaled first teased the video on Instagram. It was released on May 17, 2019, along with a video of \"Higher\", which also appears on the album.

Khaled's value proposition is his extensive network of artists of whom he enlists to perform on studio recordings. While first accumulating such connections from his work as a live DJ and radio personality, he's since become known himself for numerous quips and phrases uttered on these records—many of which became Internet memes. Furthermore, his interviews, quotes, or other presentative qualities have often been described as \"motivational\" or \"inspirational\". Despite commercial success, the albums in Khaled's discography have often garnered largely mixed receptions from music critics.\nEach released independently, Khaled released his first four albums: Listennn... the Album on June 6, 2006 (reaching number 12 on the Billboard 200), We the Best on June 12, 2007 (number eight), We Global on September 16, 2007 (number seven), and Victory on March 2, 2010 (number 14).

His second album, Goblin (2011), brought him mainstream media exposure, aided by the popularity of the single \"Yonkers\" and its accompanying music video. During this period, Okonma faced controversy in the media for his horrorcore-influenced sound and his violent, transgressive lyrical content.\nAfter the release of his third album, Wolf (2013), Okonma began to separate himself from his horrorcore productions, turning to more accessible sounds including fusions of jazz, soul and R&B. In 2015, Tyler released his fourth album, Cherry Bomb. It features artists such as Lil Wayne and Kanye West.

He spent his early life living in Hawthorne before moving to Ladera Heights at 17. At the age of seven, he would take covers out of CD cases and create covers for his own imaginary albums—including a tracklist with song lengths—before he could even make music. At the age of 14, he taught himself to play the piano.\nIn his 12 years of schooling, he attended 12 different schools in the Los Angeles and Sacramento areas. In the eighth grade, Okonma joined a drama class and was kicked out for being too hyperactive, and in the ninth grade, he was not allowed to join the band class because he could not read music.\nHe worked at FedEx for under two weeks, and at Starbucks for over two years. Okonma took his stage name from a Myspace page he used to post his creative endeavors.\nWhen Okonma was 15, he had a YouTube channel named \"Bloxhead\".

The artists wrote the song with Joe Zarrillo who produced it with Khaled and Beyoncé. It was released on March 2, 2018, as the lead single from Khaled's eleventh studio album, Father of Asahd. Complex magazine ranked Beyoncé's verse on the song as the second best on the album; she performed it during her 2018 Coachella performance and subsequently included it in Homecoming: The Live Album (2019).\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nOn February 28, 2018, DJ Khaled announced that he would reveal the title of his upcoming album and release its lead single on March 1, 2018. Prior to the release, Khaled posted a video of him playing the song for comedian Kevin Hart, who reacted by saying: \"The world flatlined.\"\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\"Top Off\" received mixed reviews from critics. According to Billboard's Gil Kaufman, \"Top Off\" is \"a breathless outlaw track about outrunning the police and enjoying the finer things\". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times disliked Future's verse, writing: \"Once you swipe away the numbing hook and pseudo-verse from Future, there, plain as day, is an impressive Jay-Z/Beyoncé duet.\" Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork gave a negative review of the song, writing that it is \"more bland than it is bizarrely successful, proof that Khaled's blockbuster-stuffed style often suffocates under the heft of its own bravado\". He opined that the artists' personalities \"are simply too distinct at this point to produce something compelling when shoved together on the same track\". Pat King of Metro named it \"one of the catchiest songs in recent memory about outrunning the cops\". Adreon Patterson of Paste felt that \"the track is a little underwhelming considering the collaborators' musical status\". Serving as a follow-up to \"Shining\" and \"I Got the Keys\", he found the song \"disappointing and anti-climactic\". Tom Breihan of Stereogum praised Khaled for making the song sounds like both a \"fame-flexing celebrity event\" and an \"actual song\". Lauren O'Neill of Noisey complimented Beyoncé's ability \"to knock every other rapper out of the park with her skill and flow\". Bianca Gracie of Fuse declared that the song lacks innovation and fails to be memorable. \"Jay-Z and Beyoncé deserve a harder beat underneath their flows; the juvenile SoundCloud production didn't do them any favors especially on Beyoncé's opening part.\" Following the release of Father of Asahd, Frazier Tharpe of Complex magazine ranked the features on the album, with Beyoncé's verse on \"Top Off\" coming in 2nd, behind Nipsey Hussle's verse on \"Higher\". Tharpe commented that \"if there's any benefit to keeping this old dog of a song on the album, it's giving this blackout verse from B a proper home\".\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\nPerformers\n\nDJ Khaled – composition, production, vocals\nJay-Z – composition, vocals\nFuture – composition, vocals\nBeyoncé – composition, production, vocals\nAdditional musician\n\nJoe Zarrillo – composition, production\nTechnical\n\nManny Marroquin – mix engineering\nChris Athens – master engineering\nChris Galland – engineering\nRobin Florent – engineering assistance\nScott Desmarais – engineering assistance\nJuan Peña – record engineering\nYoung Guru – record engineering\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"DJ Khaled - Top Off (Audio) ft.

The song was released on July 27, 2018, by We the Best Music Group and Epic Records, the second single from Khaled's eleventh studio album, Father of Asahd (2019). It marks the second collaboration between the artists, following 2017's \"I'm the One\" (which also featured Lil Wayne), from Khaled's tenth studio album Grateful. Khaled produced the song with DaviDior, Sir Nolan, Nic Nac and Poo Bear. The song peaked within the top ten of the charts in Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nIn early July, DJ Khaled shared plans for his song, inspired by his vacation to Cabo San Lucas. \"I'm gonna make my own soap,\" he said. \"So I'm here to announce today—and this is crazy that we're talking about this—I'm gonna make my own soap.\" He also revealed, \"I got a song coming out with Justin Bieber and some more of my great friends on the record. I want it to be a surprise, but it's going to be one of the biggest anthems.\" In a series of teasers on Instagram, he gradually rolled out the news. In one video, Justin and his manager, Scooter Braun, joined in and showcased their southern accents. \"We've always been the best and always will be the best. That's a statement and a half,\" Bieber teased.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nBillboard's Sam Tornow described the song as a potential summer hit with its \"all-star cast, bubbly beats and infectious chorus\". He wrote: \"The crew keeps the hype up all the way through, from Bieber's first chorus until his last. Every collaborator holds his own, accenting each other's different styles while still popping off during his own verse.\" Conversely, Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork called the song \"gratuitous fun that's derivative and shiftless and capitalistic\".\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\nIn the United States, the song debuted at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100, making it Khaled's fourth top-ten song, Bieber's 14th, Chance the Rapper notches his second and Quavo posts his fifth top ten on the chart.

As for other countries, the song reached the top ten of the charts of Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and Ireland.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video premiered via YouTube an hour after the song's release. Directed by Colin Tilley, the video begins on the set of a movie in Hollywood with \"We The Best\" replacing the typical white Hollywood Sign. Bieber helms the director chair alongside Khaled and his son, Asahd. One part of the video is highly reminiscent of a scene from the film Wayne's World, as Khaled and Justin stand atop the faux clouds. Product placement is heavily displayed throughout the blockbuster, boasting different liquors from Bumbu to Ciroc and Belaire. Quavo injects himself into the colorful scene taking on the role of an artist, meticulously painting away at his blank canvas with a parrot mysteriously chilling out on his shoulder. Chance is the last of the co-stars to make an appearance, and the setting immediately switches to a Gatsby-themed party, as the squad dances the night away.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==\nThe discography of Jeezy, an American rapper, consists of thirteen studio albums, 18 mixtapes, 70 singles (including 38 as a featured artist) and 28 music videos.

One part of the video is highly reminiscent of a scene from the film Wayne's World, as Khaled and Justin stand atop the faux clouds. Product placement is heavily displayed throughout the blockbuster, boasting different liquors from Bumbu to Ciroc and Belaire. Quavo injects himself into the colorful scene taking on the role of an artist, meticulously painting away at his blank canvas with a parrot mysteriously chilling out on his shoulder. Chance is the last of the co-stars to make an appearance, and the setting immediately switches to a Gatsby-themed party, as the squad dances the night away.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications =="
