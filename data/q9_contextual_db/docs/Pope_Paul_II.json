{"page_content": "Pope Paul II (Latin: Paulus II; Italian: Paolo II; 23 February 1417 \u2013 26 July 1471), born Pietro Barbo, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 30 August 1464 to his death. When his maternal uncle became  Pope Eugene IV, Barbo switched from training to be a merchant to religious studies. His rise in the Church was relatively rapid. Elected pope in 1464, Paul amassed a great collection of art and antiquities.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nPietro Barbo was born in Venice, the son of Niccolo and Polixena Condulmer. His mother was the sister of Pope Eugene IV (1431\u20131447). Through his father he was a member of the noble Barbo family. His adoption of the spiritual career, after having been trained as a merchant, was prompted by his uncle's election as pope. His consequent promotion was rapid. He became Archdeacon of Bologna, and Bishop of Cervia and of Vicenza, and in 1440 became a cardinal-deacon. While he was in Rome, Vicenza was administered by his brother, Paolo Barbo. Barbo gained popularity through his generosity. He might have boasted that if elected pope he would buy each cardinal a villa to escape the summer heat.\nAfter having been lay abbot of Santa Maria in Sylvis since 1441, in 1445 he succeeded Giuliano Cesarini as archpriest of the Vatican Basilica. Barbo was very influential under Eugene IV, Nicholas V, and Calixtus III, but less so under Pius II. Barbo had a marked propensity to enjoy dressing up in sumptuous ecclesiastical finery.\n\n\n== Election ==\n\nBarbo was elected to succeed Pope Pius II by the accessus in the first ballot of the papal conclave of 30 August 1464 with a majority of fourteen of the nineteen cardinals present. He owed his election in part to the dissatisfaction of some of the cardinals with the policy of his predecessor.\nUpon taking office, Paul II was to convene an ecumenical council within three years. But these terms of subscription were modified by Paul II at his own discretion, and this action lost him the confidence of the College of Cardinals. The justification for setting aside the capitulations, seen to be under way by the Duke of Milan's ambassador as early as 21 September, lay in connecting any abridgement of the Pope's absolute monarchy in the Papal States with a consequent abridgement of his sole authority in spiritual matters. Almost from his coronation, Paul withdrew and became inaccessible: audiences were only granted at night and even good friends waited a fortnight to see him. His suspiciousness was widely attested.\nPaul wore rouge in public. The story of Cardinal Ammanati that he meant to take the name Formosus II (meaning \"handsome\"), after Pope Formosus, but was persuaded not to, is more often repeated than the story that he was dissuaded from Marcus, being Venetian and the Cardinal of San Marco, because it was also the war-cry of Venice. He had a papal tiara made for his own use studded with \"diamonds, sapphires, emeralds, topaz, large pearls, and every kind of precious gem\". He built the Palazzo San Marco (now the Palazzo Venezia) and lived there even as pope, amassing a great collection of art and antiquities.\n\n\n== Conflict ==\nA sore point was his abuse of the practice of creating cardinals in pectore, without publishing their names. Eager to raise new cardinals to increase the number who were devoted to his interests, but restricted by the terms of the capitulation, which gave the college a voice in the creation of new members, in the winter of 1464\u201365 Paul created two secret cardinals both of whom died before their names could be published. In his fourth year as Pope, he created eight new cardinals on 18 September 1467. Five were candidates pressed by kings, placating respectively James II of Cyprus, Edward IV of England, Louis XI of France, Matthias Corvinus of Hungary and Ferdinand I of Naples; one was the able administrator of the Franciscans; and the last two elevated his old tutor and a first cardinal-nephew. Two further cardinal-nephews were added on 21\nPope  John Paul II (Latin: Ioannes Paulus II; Polish: Jan Pawe\u0142 II; Italian: Giovanni Paolo II; born Karol J\u00f3zef Wojty\u0142a, Polish: [\u02c8kar\u0254l \u02c8juz\u025bv v\u0254j\u02c8t\u0268wa]; 18 May 1920 \u2013 2 April 2005) was head of the Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican City State from 1978 until his death in 2005.\nIn his youth, Wojty\u0142a dabbled in stage acting. He graduated with excellent grades from an all-boys high school in Wadowice, Poland, in 1938, soon after which World War II broke out. During the war, to avoid being kidnapped and sent off to a German forced labour camp, he signed up for work in harsh conditions in a quarry. Wojty\u0142a eventually took up acting and developed a love for the profession and participated at a local theatre. The linguistically skilled Wojty\u0142a wanted to study Polish at university. Encouraged by a conversation with Adam Stefan Sapieha, he decided to study theology and become a priest. Eventually, Wojty\u0142a rose to the position of Archbishop of Krak\u00f3w and then a cardinal, both positions held by his mentor. Wojty\u0142a was elected pope on the third day of the second papal conclave of 1978, and became one of the youngest popes in history. The conclave was called after the death of John Paul I, who served only 33 days as pope. Wojty\u0142a adopted the name of his predecessor in tribute to him.\nJohn Paul II was the first non-Italian pope since Adrian VI in the 16th century, as well as the third-longest-serving pope in history after Pius IX and St. Peter. John Paul II attempted to improve the Catholic Church's relations with Judaism, Islam, and the Eastern Orthodox Church in the spirit of ecumenism, holding atheism as the greatest threat. He maintained the Church's previous positions on such matters as abortion, artificial contraception, the ordination of women, and a celibate clergy, and although he supported the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, he was seen as generally conservative in their interpretation. He put emphasis on family and identity, while questioning consumerism, hedonism and the pursuit of wealth. He was one of the most travelled world leaders in history, visiting 129 countries during his pontificate. As part of his special emphasis on the universal call to holiness, John Paul II beatified 1,344 people, and canonised 483 saints, more than the combined tally of his predecessors during the preceding five centuries. By the time of his death, he had named most of the College of Cardinals, consecrated or co-consecrated many of the world's bishops, and ordained many priests.\nHe has been credited with fighting against dictatorships for democracy and with helping to end communist rule in his native Poland and the rest of Europe. Under John Paul II, the Catholic Church greatly expanded its influence in Africa and Latin America and retained its influence in Europe and the rest of the world. On 19 December 2009, John Paul II was proclaimed venerable by his successor, Benedict XVI, and on 1 May 2011 (Divine Mercy Sunday) he was beatified. On 27 April 2014, he was canonised together with John XXIII. He has been criticised for allegedly, as archbishop, having been insufficiently harsh in acting against the sexual abuse of children by priests in Poland, though the allegations themselves have been criticised. Posthumously he has been referred to by some Catholics as Pope St. John Paul the Great, though that title has no official recognition.\nUnder John Paul II, the two most important constitutions of the contemporary Catholic Church were drafted and put in force: the 1983 Code of Canon Law, which, among many things, began an effort to curb sexual abuse in the Catholic Church; and the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which among other things clarified the Church's position on homosexuality.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nKarol J\u00f3zef Wojty\u0142a was born in the Polish town of Wadowice. He was the youngest of three children born to Karol Wojty\u0142a (1879\u20131941), an ethnic Pole, and Emilia Kaczorowska (1884\u20131929), who was of distant Lithuanian heritage. \nOn 2 April 2005, Pope John Paul II died at the age of 84. His funeral was held on 8 April, followed by the novendiales devotional in which the Catholic Church observed nine days of mourning.\nIn February 1996 Pope John Paul II had introduced revisions to papal funeral ceremonies, including changes to repose and burial formalities. These revisions were enacted through the apostolic constitution Universi Dominici gregis, and applied to his own funeral.\nThe funeral had around four million mourners gathering in Rome in the wake of his death.\nEcumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople was in the honorary first seat in the section reserved for churches not in full communion with the Catholic Church. This was the first time an ecumenical patriarch attended a papal funeral since the East\u2013West Schism.\n\n\n== Death ==\nOn 2 April 2005, Joaqu\u00edn Navarro-Valls, director of the Holy See Press Office, announced that John Paul II had died that day, at 84 years old, at 9:37 p.m. in his private apartment.\n\n\n== Rite of papal death ==\nWhen John Paul II died, the Camerlengo Eduardo Mart\u00ednez Somalo removed the Pope's Ring of the Fisherman from his finger, then ceremonially crushed it with the ceremonial silver hammer in the presence of members of the College of Cardinals. \n\nWhile his predecessors had been embalmed after death, the Vatican claimed that Pope John Paul II was not embalmed and lay in state without normal treatment for preservation, which is evident by the grey colour taken on by the body. Also, it was customary for popes to have their organs removed after death. Pope Pius X ended this practice during his reign, and the wish of some Poles that John Paul II's heart be buried in Poland was not obliged.\n\n\n=== Mass of Repose ===\nA first Mass of Repose, such as is offered for anyone baptised in the Catholic Church, commemorating the sending of the soul to God, was led by Cardinal Angelo Sodano, Cardinal Secretary of State, on 3 April 2005, the day after the death of the Pope. That Sunday liturgy coincided with the celebration of the Feast of Divine Mercy, a feast instituted by Pope John Paul II himself. The service was followed by the recitation of the Regina Caeli, at which Archbishop Leonardo Sandri, Substitute of the Secretariat of State read out the words that John Paul II himself wrote for the occasion and was due to recite.\n\n\n== Rite of Visitation ==\n\nThe body of John Paul II was dressed in his vestments and moved to the Clementine Hall on the third level (considered the second floor) of the Apostolic Palace on 3 April.\n\n\n== Requiem Mass ==\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger celebrated the Mass of Requiem on 8 April at 10:00 am CEST (08:00 UTC), by virtue of his office as Dean of the College of Cardinals.\n\n\n=== Processional ===\n\nAs the Mass of Requiem began, the doors of St. Peter's Basilica were locked with dignitaries asked to stand outside the church. Only the College of Cardinals and the patriarchs and presiding metropolitans of the Eastern Catholic Churches were allowed inside for a private ceremony in which John Paul was placed in a cypress coffin, the first of three. Before being laid in the coffin, Archbishops Marini and Stanis\u0142aw Dziwisz had the honour of placing a white silk veil over the face of the pope (a tradition started by Leo XIII). It was his last official act of service to the pope as his papal secretary.\n\n\n=== Homily ===\nAfter kissing the text of the Book of the Gospels, Cardinal Ratzinger stood before the congregants to offer the homily which included references to the life and service of Pope John Paul II. He spoke in Italian, first greeting the many political figures and religious leaders that had gathered, and then told the story of how the young Karol had answered the Lord's call, and became a priest after the persecution of the Nazis, the answer of the command: \"Follow me!\". Cardinal Ratzinger also told of John Paul II's life as a bishop, cardinal, and pope, frequently applying scripture to the pope's life. Fina\nOn 13 May 1981, in St. Peter's Square in Vatican City, Pope John Paul II was shot and wounded by Mehmet Ali A\u011fca while he was entering the square. The Pope was struck twice and suffered severe blood loss. A\u011fca was apprehended immediately and later sentenced to life in prison by an Italian court. The Pope forgave A\u011fca for the assassination attempt. He was pardoned by Italian president Carlo Azeglio Ciampi at the Pope's request and was deported to Turkey in June 2000. A\u011fca converted to Roman Catholicism in 2007.\n\n\n== Attempted assassination ==\n\nIn 1979, The New York Times reported that A\u011fca, whom it called \"the self-confessed killer of an Istanbul newspaperman\" (Abdi \u0130pek\u00e7i, editor of the Turkish newspaper Milliyet), had described the Pope as \"the masked leader of the crusades\" and threatened to shoot him if he did not cancel his planned visit to Turkey, which went ahead in late November 1979. The paper also said (on 28 November 1979) that the killing would be in revenge for the then still ongoing attack on the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which had begun on 20 November, and which he blamed on the United States or Israel.\nBeginning in August 1980, A\u011fca, under the alias of Vilperi, began criss-crossing the Mediterranean region, changing passports and identities, perhaps to hide his point of origin in Sofia, Bulgaria. He entered Rome on 10 May 1981, coming by train from Milan. According to A\u011fca's later testimony, he met with three accomplices in Rome, one a fellow Turk and two Bulgarians, with the operation being commanded by Zilo Vassilev, the Bulgarian military attach\u00e9 in Italy. He said that he was assigned this mission by Turkish mafioso Bekir \u00c7elenk in Bulgaria. According to A\u011fca, the plan was for him and the back-up gunman Oral \u00c7elik to open fire on the pope in St. Peter's Square and escape to the Bulgarian embassy under the cover of the panic generated by a small explosion.\nOn 13 May, A\u011fca sat in the square, writing postcards and waiting for the Pope to arrive. When the Pope passed through a crowd of supporters, A\u011fca fired four shots at 17:17 with a 9mm Browning Hi-Power semi-automatic pistol, and critically wounded him. He fled the scene as the crowd was in shock and disposed of the pistol by throwing it under a truck, but was grabbed by Vatican security chief Camillo Cibin, a nun, and several spectators who prevented him from firing more shots or escaping, and he was arrested. Two bullets hit John Paul II; one of them in his torso, narrowly missing vital organs, and a second hit his left index finger. Two bystanders were also injured: Ann Odre, of Buffalo, New York, was struck in the chest, and Rose Hall, of Frankfurt, West Germany, was slightly wounded in the arm. The Pope was immediately rushed to the hospital while the authorities combed the site for evidence. \u00c7elik panicked and fled without opening fire.\n\n\n== Incarceration of A\u011fca ==\nA\u011fca was sentenced in July 1981 to life imprisonment for the assassination attempt, but was pardoned by Italian president Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in June 2000 at the Pope's request. He was then extradited to Turkey, where he was imprisoned for the 1979 murder of left-wing journalist Abdi \u0130pek\u00e7i and two bank raids carried out in the 1970s. Despite a plea for early release in November 2004, a Turkish court announced that he would not be eligible for release until 2010. Nonetheless, he was released on parole on 12 January 2006. However, on 20 January 2006, the Turkish Supreme Court ruled that his time served in Italy could not be deducted from his Turkish sentence and he was returned to jail. A\u011fca was released from prison on 18 January 2010, after almost 29 years behind bars.\n\n\n== Relationship with Pope John Paul II ==\nFollowing the shooting, Pope John Paul II asked people to \"pray for my brother [A\u011fca] ... whom I have sincerely forgiven.\" In 1983, he and A\u011fca met and spoke privately at Rome's Rebibbia Prison, where A\u011fca was being held. A\u011fca reportedly kissed the Pope's ring at the conclusion of their\nThis article contains the saints canonized by Pope John Paul II.

In total he logged more than 1,167,000 km (725,000 mi). He consistently attracted large crowds on his travels, some among largest ever assembled. While some of his trips (such as to the United States and Israel) were to places that were previously visited by Paul VI (the first pope to travel widely), many others were to countries that no pope had previously visited.\n\n\n== Countries visited ==\nPope John Paul II visited 129 countries during his time as pope:\n\nNine visits to Poland\nEight visits to France (including one visit to R\u00e9union)\nSeven visits to the United States (including two stopovers in Alaska)\nFive visits to Mexico and Spain\nFour visits to Brazil, Portugal, and Switzerland\nThree visits to Austria, Canada, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Croatia, Czech Republic (including one visit to Czechoslovakia), Dominican Republic, Germany, Guatemala, Kenya, Malta (including one stopover in Luqa,) and Slovakia (including one visit to Czechoslovakia)\nTwo visits to Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Benin, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, El Salvador, Hungary, India, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Slovenia, South Korea, Uruguay, and Venezuela\nOne visit to Albania, Angola, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Belize, Bolivia, Botswana, Bulgaria, Burundi, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Chile, Colombia, Congo, Costa Rica, Cuba, Denmark, East Timor (then part of Indonesia), Ecuador, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Estonia, Fiji, Finland, Gabon, Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Greece, Guam, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Honduras, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritius, Morocco, Mozambique, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Palestinian territories, Panama, Paraguay, Romania, Rwanda, Saint Lucia, San Marino, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Senegal, Seychelles, Singapore, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Swaziland, Sweden, Syria, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.\nIn addition, John Paul II made 146 pastoral visits within Italy.\n\n\n== Travels outside Italy ==\n\n\n=== 1970s ===\n\nPope John Paul II's first foreign journey was a three-country visit to the Dominican Republic, Mexico and the Bahamas in January 1979. Some 18 million people were believed to have greeted the Pope during his stay in Mexico.\nThe Pope's second foreign visit was to his homeland, Poland, in June 1979. This was possibly the most significant of all his trips as it, according to some historians, set in train a series of events that led to the establishment of the Solidarity trade union, which was a key movement in the fall of Communism in eastern Europe. During his visit to Poland, John Paul visited Warsaw, Gniezno, Krak\u00f3w, Nowy Targ, Auschwitz and Jasna G\u00f3ra. The nine-day tour attracted millions of faithful.\nThe Pope's visit to Ireland on 29 September drew immense crowds. 1,250,000 people, one quarter of the population of the island of Ireland, one third of the population of the Republic of Ireland, attended the opening Mass of the visit in Dublin's Phoenix Park. Over 250,000 attended a Liturgy of the Word in Drogheda later that evening. Hundreds of thousands lined the streets of Dublin that night for a motorcade from Dublin Airport to the Presidential Residence in the Phoenix Park.\nThe following day, Sunday 30 September, included Masses in Galway (300,000), Knock (450,000) and a stop over at the monastic ruins of Clonmacnois (20,000). The final day of the visit began with a visit to the National Seminary in Maynooth (attended by 80,000).

His reign is among the shortest in papal history, resulting in the most recent year of three popes and the first to occur since 1605. John Paul I remains the most recent Italian-born pope, the last in a succession of such popes that started with Clement VII in 1523.\nBefore the August 1978 papal conclave that elected him, he expressed his desire not to be elected, telling those close to him that he would decline the papacy if elected; upon the cardinals' electing him, he felt an obligation to say yes. He was the first pontiff to have a double name, choosing \"John Paul\" in honour of his two immediate predecessors, John XXIII and Paul VI. He explained that he was indebted to John XXIII and to Paul VI for naming him a bishop and a cardinal, respectively. Furthermore, he was the first pope to add the regnal number \"I\", designating himself \"the First\".\nHis two immediate successors, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, later recalled the warm qualities of the late pontiff in several addresses. In Italy, he is remembered with the appellatives of Il Papa del Sorriso (transl.\u2009The Smiling Pope) and Il Sorriso di Dio (transl.\u2009The Smile of God). Time magazine and other publications referred to him as \"The September Pope\". He is also known in Italy as \"Papa Luciani\". In his hometown of Canale d'Agordo a museum built and named in his honour is dedicated to his life and brief papacy.\nHe was declared a servant of God by his successor, John Paul II, on 23 November 2003, the first step on the road to sainthood. Pope Francis confirmed his heroic virtue on 8 November 2017 and named him as Venerable. Pope Francis presided over the beatification on 4 September 2022.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\n\nAlbino Luciani was born on 17 October 1912 in Forno di Canale (now Canale d'Agordo) in Belluno, a province of the Veneto region in Northern Italy. He was the son of Giovanni Luciani (c. 1872\u20131952), a bricklayer, and Bortola Tancon (c. 1879\u20131947). Albino was followed by two brothers, Federico (1915\u20131916) and Edoardo (1917\u20132008), and a sister, Antonia (1920\u20132010). He was baptised on the day he was born by the midwife because he was considered to be in danger of death. The solemn rites of baptism were formalised in the parish church two days later.\nLuciani was a restless child. In 1922, aged 10, he was awestruck when a Capuchin friar came to his village to preach the Lenten sermons. From that moment, he decided that he wanted to become a priest and went to his father to ask for his permission. His father agreed and said to him: \"I hope that when you become a priest you will be on the side of the workers, for Christ Himself would have been on their side\".\nLuciani entered the minor seminary of Feltre in 1923, where his teachers found him \"too lively\", and later went on to the major seminary of Belluno. During his stay at Belluno, he attempted to join the Jesuits. However, he was denied by the seminary's rector, Bishop Giosu\u00e8 Cattarossi.\n\n\n== Ordination and teaching career ==\nOrdained a priest on 7 July 1935, Luciani then served as a curate in his native Forno de Canale before becoming a professor and the vice-rector of the Belluno seminary in 1937. Among the different subjects, he taught dogmatic and moral theology, canon law and sacred art.\nIn 1941, Luciani started to work on a Doctorate of Sacred Theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University. This required at least one year's attendance in Rome. However, the Belluno seminary's superiors wanted him to continue teaching during his doctoral studies. The situation was resolved by a special dispensation by Pope Pius XII on 27 March 1941. His thesis (The origin of the human soul according to Antonio Rosmini) largely attacked Rosmini's theology and earned\nPope John Paul II is a 2005 television miniseries dramatizing the life of Pope John Paul II (Karol J\u00f3zef Wojty\u0142a) from his early adult years in Poland to his death at age 84.\nThe miniseries was written and directed by John Kent Harrison and aired in the United States on the CBS network on 4 and 7 December 2005.

Polish actor Mikolaj Grabowski is seen twice playing Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger of Germany, who would succeed John Paul II as Pope Benedict XVI.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nPart 1: (4 December 2005)\nThe miniseries opens in 1981 with the Pope John Paul II assassination attempt, then flashes back to the young Karol \"Lolek\" Wojtyla who survives World War II by working in Krak\u00f3w's Zakrzowek quarry and Solvay's chemical plant while secretly embracing the illicit Theatre of Poland to keep Polish culture alive. Wojtyla accepts a calling to study for the priesthood and joins an underground seminary, involving himself non violently in the Polish Resistance movement. In 1945, World War II ends with the Soviet occupation and eventual takeover of Poland. In 1946, Wojtyla is ordained a priest and is sent to Rome for his graduate studies while the Communists hunt down and eliminate anybody who had any ties to the Home Army and/or Polish government in exile during the war. Wojtyla returns to Poland in 1948 for his first pastoral assignment in Niegowic. In 1949, he is transferred St. Florian's church in Krakow, where he also is a counselor to students at Jagiellonian University. Adam Sapieha, one of his mentors, dies in 1951. In 1956, Wojtyla is appointed ethics professor at the Catholic University of Lublin. In 1958, the Holy See appoints him Krak\u00f3w's auxiliary bishop\u2014Poland's youngest bishop ever and in 1959, he ends the decade by holding Nowa Huta's first Mass outdoors on Christmas Eve in the Communists's newly completed \"city without God\".\nAfter leading an unusual procession of the Black Madonna's empty picture frame through Krakow, Wojtyla attends all four Vatican II sessions, where he impresses many influential foreign cardinals with his charisma, multilingualism and viewpoints, both before and during his term as Krak\u00f3w's archbishop. After being made a cardinal in 1967 by Pope Paul VI, Wojtyla returns to Poland as Karol Cardinal Wojtyla, and miraculously cures a bone marrow cancer victim by praying to Padre Pio. Paul VI dies in 1978 and papal conclave, August 1978 convenes, electing Albino Cardinal Luciani as Pope John Paul I, who himself dies only 33 days later. The cardinals then reconvene with papal conclave, October 1978 and Wojtyla is told by Wyszynski to accept the position if he is elected\u2014for Poland's sake.\nPart 2: (7 December 2005)\nOpening on October 16, 1978 with deadlocked balloting, Wojtyla wins the papal election as the first non-Italian pope since Adrian VI in 1522, naming himself John Paul II. In his papal inauguration speech, he says \"be not afraid\", causing Soviet leaders to decide that Wojtyla is \"no friend of Marxism\". Afterwards, he performs papal mediation in the Beagle conflict between Argentina and Chile. In 1979, he receives Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko at the Vatican, writes his first papal encyclical\u2014Redemptor hominis\u2014and visits Mexico where he is seen by millions. He then visits Poland with audiences also in the millions and afterwards the United States. He supports Polish Solidarity and receives Lech Walesa at the Vatican. The 1981 assassination attempt occurs. After his recovery, Pope John Paul II appoints Cardinal R\nPope John Paul II reigned as pope of the Roman Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican City State for 26 years from October 1978 to his death, on 2 April 2005. Since his death, many thousands of people have been supporting the case for beatifying and canonising Pope John Paul II as a saint. His formal beatification ceremony took place on 1 May 2011.\n\n\n== Beatification ==\n\nJohn Paul II's official title was \"Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of Saint Peter, Head of the College of Bishops, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Patriarch of the West, Primate of Italy, Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Roman Province, Sovereign of the State of the Vatican City, Servus Servorum Dei, Pope John Paul II\". In 2006 the title Patriarch of the West was removed from the papal list of titles by the succeeding pope, Benedict XVI, due to its obsolescence.\nOn 9 May 2005, Benedict XVI began the beatification process for his predecessor. Normally five years must pass after a person's death before the beatification process can begin. However, in an audience with Pope Benedict XVI, Cardinal Vicar Camillo Ruini, the one responsible for promoting the cause for canonisation of any person who dies within the diocese of Rome, cited \"exceptional circumstances\" which suggested that the waiting period could be waived.\nThe \"exceptional circumstances\" may possibly refer to the people's cries of \"Santo Subito!\" (\"Saint now!\" in Italian) during the pontiff's funeral. Therefore, the new pope waived the five year rule \"so that the cause of Beatification and Canonisation of the same Servant of God can begin immediately\". The decision was announced on 13 May 2005, the Feast of Our Lady of F\u00e1tima and the 24th anniversary of the assassination attempt on John Paul II at St. Peter's Square. John Paul II often credited Our Lady of F\u00e1tima for preserving him on that day. Cardinal Camillo Ruini, vicar general for the diocese of Rome, officially opened the cause for beatification in the Lateran Basilica on 28 June 2005.\nIn early 2006, it was reported that the Vatican was investigating a possible miracle associated with John Paul II. Sister Marie Simon-Pierre, a French nun confined to her bed by Parkinson's disease, was reported to have woken up free of symptoms on 2 June 2005, \"after members of her community prayed for the intercession of Pope John Paul II\". A member of the Congregation of Little Sisters of Catholic Motherhood from Puyricard, near Aix-en-Provence, Simon-Pierre returned to work at a maternity hospital run by her order. She met reporters 30 March 2006 in Aix-en-Provence, during a press conference with Archbishop of Aix Claude Feidt, saying \"I am cured, but it is up to the church to say whether it was a miracle or not\".\nHowever, Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita reported that Simon-Pierre had a relapse of her symptoms in 2010, and suggested that Simon-Pierre did not have Parkinson's but a neurological condition with similar symptoms that could go into remission or be cured, noting that there is no easy way to accurately diagnose the disease short of medical autopsy. The Episcopal Conference of France disputed that the relapse (which would have thrown the purportedly miraculous nature of the cure into doubt) was anything more than a rumour.\nOn 28 May 2006, Pope Benedict XVI said Mass before an estimated 900,000 people in John Paul II's native Poland. During his homily he encouraged prayers for the early canonisation of John Paul II and stated that he hoped canonisation would happen \"in the near future\".\nIn January 2007, it was announced by Cardinal Stanis\u0142aw Dziwisz of Krak\u00f3w, his former secretary, that the key interviewing phase in Italy and Poland of the beatification process was nearing completion. The relics of Pope John Paul II\u2014pieces of white papal cassocks he used to wear\u2014were being freely distributed with prayer cards for the cause to interested parties; this distribution and prayerful use of relics is a typical praiseworthy pious\nPope John Paul II made many apologies. During his long reign as Pope, he apologized to Jews, women, people convicted by the Inquisition, Muslims killed by the Crusaders and almost everyone who had suffered at the hands of the Catholic Church over the years. Even before he became the Pope, he was a prominent editor and supporter of initiatives like the Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops from 1965. As Pope, he officially made public apologies for over 100 of these wrongdoings, including:\n\nChristians involved in the African slave trade (14 August 1985, also at various points in the 1990s)\nThe Church's role in burnings at the stake and the religious wars that followed the Protestant Reformation (May 1995, in the Czech Republic).\nIn a June 1995, \"Letter to Women\", John Paul said, \"Women's dignity has often been unacknowledged and their prerogatives misrepresented; they have often been relegated to the margins of society and even reduced to servitude...Certainly it is no easy task to assign the blame for this, considering the many kinds of cultural conditioning which down the centuries have shaped ways of thinking and acting. And if objective blame, especially in particular historical contexts, has belonged to not just a few members of the Church, for this I am truly sorry.\"\nThe inactivity and silence of many Catholics during the Holocaust (16 March 1998). The Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews issued a statement: We cannot know how many Christians in countries occupied or ruled by the Nazi powers or their allies were horrified at the disappearance of their Jewish neighbours and yet were not strong enough to raise their voices in protest. For Christians, this heavy burden of conscience of their brothers and sisters during the Second World War must be a call to penitence.\nCardinal Miloslav Vlk of Prague was instrumental in crafting an apology by John Paul II for the \"cruel death\" of the famed medieval Czech reformer Jan Hus in 1415. In his 18 December 1999 speech in Prague, John Paul expressed \"deep sorrow\" for Hus' death and praised his \"moral courage.\"\nFor the Crusaders' Sack of Constantinople in 1204. To the Patriarch of Constantinople he said \"Some memories are especially painful, and some events of the distant past have left deep wounds in the minds and hearts of people to this day. I am thinking of the disastrous sack of the imperial city of Constantinople, which was for so long the bastion of Christianity in the East. It is tragic that the assailants, who had set out to secure free access for Christians to the Holy Land, turned against their own brothers in the faith. The fact that they were Latin Christians fills Catholics with deep regret. How can we fail to see here the mysterium iniquitatis at work in the human heart?\".\nOn 20 November 2001, from a laptop in the Vatican, Pope John Paul II sent his first e-mail apologizing for the Catholic sex abuse cases, the Church-backed \"Stolen Generations\" of Aboriginal children in Australia, and to China for the behavior of Catholic missionaries in colonial times.\nIn December 1999, at the request of Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, then Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith who would later become Pope Benedict XVI, the International Theological Commission presented its study on the topic Memory and Reconciliation: The Church and the Faults of the Past. The purpose of this document is \"not to examine particular historical cases but rather to clarify the presuppositions that ground repentance for past faults.\" It examines repentance for past faults in the context of sociology, ecclesiology and theology.\nThe Great Jubilee of the year 2000 included a day of Prayer for Forgiveness of the Sins of the Church on March 12, 2000.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nThe homily of Pope John Paul II at  the Day of Pardon, Sunday, 12 March 2000\nPope Paul VI (Latin: Paulus VI; Italian: Paolo VI; born Giovanni Battista Enrico Antonio Maria Montini, Italian: [d\u0292o\u02c8vanni bat\u02c8tista en\u02c8ri\u02d0ko an\u02c8t\u0254\u02d0njo ma\u02c8ri\u02d0a mon\u02c8ti\u02d0ni]; 26 September 1897 \u2013 6 August 1978) was head of the Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican City State from 21 June 1963 to his death on 6 August 1978. Succeeding John XXIII, he continued the Second Vatican Council, which he closed in 1965, implementing its numerous reforms. He fostered improved ecumenical relations with Eastern Orthodox and Protestant churches, which resulted in many historic meetings and agreements. In January 1964, he flew to Jordan, the first time a reigning pontiff had left Italy in more than a century.\nMontini served in the Holy See's Secretariat of State from 1922 to 1954, and along with Domenico Tardini was considered the closest and most influential advisor of Pope Pius XII. In 1954, Pius named Montini Archbishop of Milan, the largest Italian diocese. Montini later became the Secretary of the Italian Bishops' Conference. John XXIII elevated Montini to the College of Cardinals in 1958, and after his death, Montini was, with little opposition, elected his successor, taking the name Paul VI.\nHe re-convened the Second Vatican Council, which had been suspended during the interregnum. After its conclusion, Paul VI took charge of the interpretation and implementation of its mandates, finely balancing the conflicting expectations of various Catholic groups. The resulting reforms were among the widest and deepest in the Church's history.\nPaul VI spoke repeatedly to Marian conventions and Mariological meetings, visited Marian shrines and issued three Marian encyclicals. Following Ambrose of Milan, he named Mary as the Mother of the Church during the Second Vatican Council. He described himself as a humble servant of a suffering humanity and demanded significant changes from the rich in North America and Europe in favour of the poor in the Third World. His opposition to birth control was published in the 1968 encyclical Humanae vitae.\nPope Benedict XVI, citing his heroic virtue, proclaimed him venerable on 20 December 2012. Pope Francis beatified Paul VI on 19 October 2014, after the recognition of a miracle attributed to his intercession. His liturgical feast was celebrated on the date of his birth, 26 September, until 2019 when it was changed to the date of his priestly ordination, 29 May. Pope Francis canonised him on 14 October 2018.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nGiovanni Battista Enrico Antonio Maria Montini was born in the village of Concesio, in the Province of Brescia, Lombardy, Italy, in 1897. His father, Giorgio Montini (1860\u20131943), was a lawyer, journalist, director of the Catholic Action, and member of the Italian Parliament. His mother, Giudetta Alghisi (1874\u20131943), was from a family of rural nobility. He had two brothers, Francesco Montini (1900\u20131971), who became a physician, and Lodovico Montini (1896\u20131990), who became a lawyer and politician. On 30 September 1897, he was baptised with the name Giovanni Battista Enrico Antonio Maria Montini. He attended the Cesare Arici school, run by the Jesuits, and in 1916 received a diploma from the Arnaldo da Brescia public school in Brescia. His education was often interrupted by bouts of illness.\nIn 1916, he entered the seminary to become a Catholic priest. He was ordained on 29 May 1920 in Brescia and celebrated his first Mass at the Santa Maria delle Grazie, Brescia. Montini concluded his studies in Milan with a doctorate in canon law in the same year. He later studied at the Gregorian University, the University of Rome La Sapienza and, at the request of Giuseppe Pizzardo, the Pontifical Academy of Ecclesiastical Nobles. In 1922, at the age of twenty-five, again at the request of Giuseppe Pizzardo, Montini entered the Secretariat of State, where he worked under Pizzardo together with Francesco Borgongini-Duca, Alfredo Ottaviani, Carlo Grano, Domenico Tardini and Francis Spellman. Consequentl\nPope John Paul II is a 1984 American biopic drama television film based on the life of Karol Wojty\u0142a, from his early days as an activist in Poland to his installation as Pope John Paul II. Written by Christopher Knopf and directed by Herbert Wise, the film stars Albert Finney, Caroline Bliss, Brian Cox, and John Forgeham. The film marks both Albert Finney's American television debut and the first script Finney had ever turned down upon initial reading.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThis film's timeline begins with the death of Pope John Paul I on September 28, 1978, and then flashes back to Karol Wojty\u0142a as a young man growing up decades earlier in Wadowice, Poland. The storyline then returns to pre-October 16 dates in 1978 and flashes back to Wojty\u0142a's early life, family relationships, his political involvements fighting against Nazism during World War II and against Communism afterwards in the Cold War, and his relationship and involvement in the Roman Catholic Church as he becomes a priest, a bishop, a cardinal, and is eventually installed as the titular new pope.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nOnce Karol Wojty\u0142a was installed as Pope, executive producer Alvin Cooperman made his decision to create the film project, and with the assistance of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, sought Vatican approval and cooperation. After reviewing the script, the Vatican welcomed the project.\nBritish actor Michael Compton portrayed Karol Wojty\u0142a from ages 18 through 26, and Albert Finney portrayed Wojty\u0142a from 27 years old, up to the time the former bishop was installed as Pope John Paul II. Finney had initially declined the role upon first reading the script, as he felt playing the role of someone so high-profile would be unnerving, but after re-reading the script, he accepted. Deciding that then-political problems in Poland would make shooting there problematical, producer Alvin Cooperman received permission to shoot in Yugoslavia, using Zagreb to represent Krak\u00f3w. Three days before major filming was to commence, the Yugoslavian government rescinded permission and confiscated location footage that had already been shot. The production company was told they were not welcome due to the script's anti-Communist overtones as set by Wojty\u0142a's disagreements with the Communist regime while he was a priest, cardinal and bishop. The project was subsequently filmed at locations in Austria, as well as in Italy in Caprarola and Rome.\nThe film debuted on CBS Television on Easter Sunday, April 22, 1984.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Day wrote that in their considering the difficulties in offering a project about an incumbent Pope, the filmmakers treated the subject \"with verve - and honesty\". In not being a true documentary film, the depiction of the life of Karol Wojty\u0142a was not \"tied to exact factual details\", and included the addition \"theatrical flourishes and appropriate emotional atmosphere\", but still remained \"a sound and vivid dramatization\" reflecting the biographical record of a man whose \"background had plenty of high drama in it without making it up\". They did note that \"some of the transitions were a bit ragged, and some of the ecclesiastical artificially stiff,\" but that \"generally, the story has authenticity\".\nThe Courier in noting that lead Albert Finney was Protestant, both director Herbert Wise and writer Christopher Knopf were Jewish, and cinematographer Tony Imi was Roman Catholic, wrote that the film was successful as \"a compelling story about a man, rather than a religious tract about a pontiff.\" Producer Alvin Cooperman spoke toward the difficulties extant in writing about a living exalted person, and how he worked to dispel preconceptions that he was offering either a documentary or a \"hallowed portrait\" of (then-incumbent) John Paul II.\nThe New York Times made note of difficulties inherent in creating a film about a historical person while the person is living. They offered that while a person might be mythicized after their death, and m\nPope John XXIII (25 November 1881 \u2013 3 June 1963)  and Pope John Paul II (18 May 1920 \u2013 2 April 2005) reigned as popes of the Roman Catholic Church and the sovereigns of Vatican City (respectively from 1958 to 1963 and 1978 to 2005). Their canonizations were held on 27 April 2014. The decision to canonize was made official by Pope Francis on 5 July 2013 following the recognition of a miracle attributed to the intercession of John Paul II, while John XXIII was canonized for his merits of opening the Second Vatican Council. The date of the canonization was assigned on 30 September 2013.\nThe Canonization Mass was celebrated by Pope Francis (with Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI concelebrating), on 27 April 2014 (Divine Mercy Sunday), in St. Peter's Square (Pope John Paul had died on the vigil of Divine Mercy Sunday in 2005). About 150 Cardinals and 700 bishops concelebrated the Mass, and at least 500,000 people attended the Mass with an estimated 300,000 others watching from video screens placed around Rome. This was the first and only recorded Mass in Church history where a former and current Pope both participated.\n\n\n== People present at the canonization ==\nDelegations from over a hundred States or international organizations were present for the canonization in Rome, including 19 heads of state and 24 heads of government.\n\n\n== Images ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\nPope Marcellus II (Italian: Marcello II; 6 May 1501 \u2013 1 May 1555), born Marcello Cervini degli Spannocchi, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 10 April 1555 to his death, 22 days later.\nHe succeeded Pope Julius III. Before his accession as pope he had been Cardinal-Priest of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme. He is the most recent pope to choose to retain his birth name as his regnal name upon his accession, and the most recent pope to date with the regnal name \"Marcellus\".\nCervini was the maternal uncle of Robert Bellarmine. His father, Ricardo Cervini, and Pope Clement VII were personal friends. Cervini served in the household of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese. When Farnese became Pope Paul III, Cervini served as his secretary and was employed on a number of diplomatic missions. On 10 April, 1555, he was elected to succeed Pope Julius III. He died of a stroke twenty-two days later.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nA native of Montefano, a small village near Macerata and Loreto he was the son of Ricardo Cervini who was the Apostolic Treasurer in Ancona.  The family originated in Tuscany, in the town of Montepulciano, which had once been subject to Siena, but later was under the control of Florence. Marcello had two half-brothers, Alexander and Romulus.  One of his sisters, Cinzia Cervini, married Vincenzo Bellarmino, and was the mother of Robert Bellarmine.\nMarcello was educated locally, and at Siena and Florence, where he became proficient in writing Latin, Greek, and Italian. He also received instruction in jurisprudence, philosophy, and mathematics. His father had an interest in astrology and upon discovering that his son's horoscope presaged high ecclesiastical honours, Riccardo set the young Cervini on a path to the priesthood.\n\n\n== Priesthood ==\nAfter his period of study at Siena, Cervini traveled to Rome in the company of the delegation sent by Florence to congratulate the new Pope on his election. His father and Pope Clement VII were personal friends, and Marcello was made Scrittore Apostolico. He was set to work on astronomical and calendar studies, a project which was intended to bring the year back into synchronization with the seasons. In 1527, he fled home after the Sack of Rome, but eventually returned and was taken into the household of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese senior. Cervini was ordained a priest in 1535.\n\n\n== Cardinalate ==\nIn 1534, after Farnese had become Pope Paul III, Cervini was appointed a papal secretary (1534\u201349) and served as a close advisor to the pope's nephew Alessandro Farnese. He was made a papal  protonotary. He travelled in the suite of the Pope during the papal visit to Nice, where Paul III was promoting a truce between Francis I and Charles V. He then accompanied the young Cardinal Farnese on a journey to Spain, France and the Habsburg Netherlands to help implement the terms of the truce. Paul III later appointed him Bishop of Nicastro in 1539. Cervini was not, however, consecrated bishop until the day he himself was elected pope.  On 19 December 1539, while Cervini was still on the embassy to the Netherlands, Paul III created him Cardinal-Priest of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme.\nWhen, almost immediately afterwards, Cardinal Farnese was recalled to Rome, Cervini stayed on in Spain as nuncio. Over the course of the next decade Cervini also became the apostolic administrator of the dioceses of Reggio and Gubbio. His house in Rome became a center of Renaissance culture, and he himself corresponded with most of the leading humanists.\nDuring the Council of Trent he was elected one of the council's three presidents, along with fellow cardinals Reginald Pole and Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte (the future Pope Julius III). He continued to serve in that role throughout the remainder of Paul III's papacy, after which he was replaced to placate the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V (1519\u201356). He was credited with defending not only orthodoxy and Church discipline, but also the universal claims of \nPope John Paul II was criticised for, amongst other things, an alleged lack of response to child sex abuse in the Catholic Church.\n\n\n== Child sex abuse scandals ==\n\nJohn Paul II was criticised by members of the abuse victims' group Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), for failing to respond appropriately to the sex abuse crisis. In 2002, he wrote that \"there is no place in the priesthood and religious life for those who would harm the young\". The Church instituted reforms to prevent future abuse by requiring background checks for Church employees and, because a significant majority of victims were teenage boys, disallowing ordination of men with \"deep\u2013seated homosexual tendencies\". They now require dioceses faced with an allegation to alert the authorities, conduct an investigation and remove the accused from duty. \nIn addition to cases of abuse, much of the scandal has focused around members of the Catholic hierarchy who did not report abuse allegations to the civil authorities. In many cases they reassigned those accused to other locations where they continued to have contact with minors. In defending their actions, some bishops and psychiatrists contended that the prevailing psychology of the times suggested that people could be cured of such behavior through counseling. Members of the church hierarchy have argued that media coverage has been excessive.\nIn response to the widening scandal, Pope John Paul II emphasised the spiritual nature of the offenses. He declared in 2001 that \"a sin against the Sixth Commandment of the Decalogue by a cleric with a minor under 18 years of age is to be considered a grave sin, or delictum gravius.\" With the approval of the Vatican, the hierarchy of the church in the United States said that it instituted reforms to prevent future abuse including requiring background checks for Church employees and volunteers, while opposing extensions of the statutes of limitations in sex abuse cases.\n\n\n== Opus Dei and Legion of Christ controversies ==\n\nJohn Paul II was criticised for his support of the Opus Dei prelature and the 2002 canonisation of its founder, Josemar\u00eda Escriv\u00e1, whom he called the saint of ordinary life.\n\n\n=== Legion of Christ ===\nJohn Paul II has been criticised for hindering the investigation into the charges of sexual immorality leveled against Father Marcial Maciel Degollado. This is despite the fact that Maciel was already under investigation by the Vatican in 1956 for drug addiction when he established the Legionaries in Ireland. At the time the Vatican had removed him as superior of the Legionaries and was investigating allegations that he abused morphine.\nAllegations about Maciel began resurfacing in the 1980s but were consistently ignored by the Vatican hierarchy, which approved bylaws for the group that effectively banned internal criticism of Maciel and allowed a personality cult to flourish around him. He was eventually found to have molested many seminarians and abused children he had fathered with different women despite his vows of chastity. Campaigners accuse John Paul II more generally of putting the interests of the Catholic Church above all and turning a blind eye to child sex abuse allegations.\n\n\n== Birth control and gender roles ==\n\nJohn Paul II's defense of teachings of the Catholic Church regarding gender roles, sexuality, euthanasia, artificial contraception and abortion came under criticism. Some Christian feminists challenged views of his on the role of women in society, including the ordination of women. However, John Paul was being consistent with Catholic teaching.\n\nThe legacy of Pope John Paul II is vibrant and extraordinary, yet painfully inconsistent. The contradiction in his legacy lies in his teaching and actions on the dignity of women. John Paul II called for women to be included as decision makers in secular governments. However, when it came to bringing women into the decision making bodies of his church, he slammed the door in our fa\nPope Paul III (Latin: Paulus III; Italian: Paolo III; 29 February 1468 \u2013 10 November 1549), born Alessandro Farnese, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 13 October 1534 to his death, in November 1549.\nHe came to the papal throne in an era following the sack of Rome in 1527 and rife with uncertainties in the Catholic Church as the Protestant Reformation progressed. His pontificate initiated the Catholic Reformation with the Council of Trent in 1545, and witnessed wars of religion in which Emperor Charles V launched military campaigns against the Protestants in Germany. He recognized new Catholic religious orders and societies such as the Jesuits, the Barnabites, and the Congregation of the Oratory. His efforts were distracted by nepotism to advance the power and fortunes of his family, including his illegitimate son Pier Luigi Farnese.\nPaul III was a significant patron of artists including Michelangelo, and it is to him that Nicolaus Copernicus dedicated his heliocentric treatise.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early career and family ===\nBorn in 1468 at Canino, Latium (then part of the Papal States), Alessandro Farnese was the second son of Pier Luigi I Farnese, Signore di Montalto (1435\u20131487) and his wife Giovanna Caetani, a member of the Caetani family which had also produced Pope Gelasius II and Pope Boniface VIII. The Farnese family had prospered over the centuries but it was Alessandro's ascendency to the papacy and his dedication to family interests which brought about the most significant increase in the family's wealth and power.\nAlessandro was given a humanist education at the University of Pisa and the court of Lorenzo de' Medici. Initially trained as an apostolic notary, he joined the Roman Curia in 1491 and in 1493 Pope Alexander VI appointed him Cardinal-Deacon of Santi Cosma e Damiano. Alessandro's sister, Giulia, was reputedly a mistress of Alexander VI, and might have been instrumental in securing this appointment for her brother. For this reason, he was sometimes mockingly referred to as the \"Borgia brother-in-law,\" just as Giulia was mocked as \"the Bride of Christ.\" Much later (in 1535) the Venetian nobleman Soriano recorded that Alessandro was called cardinale Fregnese (Cardinal Pussy, or Cardinal Cunt) on account of the relationship between his sister and Alexander VI.\nAs a young cleric, Alessandro lived a notably dissolute life, taking a mistress, Silvia Ruffini.  Between about 1500 and 1510 she gave birth to at least four children: Costanza, Pier Luigi (who was later created Duke of Parma), Paolo, and Ranuccio. In July 1505, Pope Julius II legitimated the two eldest sons so that they could inherit the Farnese family estates.  On 23 June 1513, Pope Leo X published a second legitimation of Pier Luigi, and also legitimated Ranuccio (the second son Paolo had already died).\nOn 28 March 1509 Alessandro was named Bishop of Parma - although he was not ordained a priest until 26 June 1519 and not consecrated a bishop until 2 July 1519. As Bishop of Parma, he came under the influence of his vicar-general, Bartolomeo Guidiccioni. This led to Alessandro breaking off the relationship with his mistress and committing himself to reform in his diocese. Under Pope Clement VII (1523\u201334) he was named Cardinal Bishop of Ostia and Dean of the College of Cardinals.\n\n\n== Pontificate ==\n\n\n=== Papal election ===\n\nOn the death of Clement VII in 1534, he was elected as Pope Paul III on 13 October 1534. Farnese, who did not fall within any of the factions, was considered a very good choice by the cardinals since his state of health denoted a short papacy which would give those cardinals time to select a proper candidate for a future conclave. On 3 November, Paul III was formally crowned by the protodeacon Innocenzo Cybo.\nThe elevation to the cardinalate of his grandsons, Alessandro Farnese, aged fourteen, and Guido Ascanio Sforza, aged sixteen, displeased the reform party and drew a protest from the emperor, \nPope John Paul II worked to improve relations between the Roman Catholic Church and Judaism. He built solid ties with the Jewish community in the hope of promoting Christian\u2013Jewish reconciliation.\n\n\n== Youth experience ==\nAs a child, Karol Wojty\u0142a had played sports with his many Jewish neighbours. He was one of the few popes to have grown up in a climate of flourishing Jewish culture, one of the key components of pre-war Krak\u00f3w, his interest in Jewish life dated from early youth. He wrote and delivered a number of speeches on the subject of the Church's relationship with Jews, and often paid homage to the victims of the Holocaust in many nations.\nIn 1998 he issued \"We Remember: A Reflection on the Shoah\" which outlined his thinking on the Holocaust.\n\n\n== Visit to synagogue ==\nHe also became the first pope known to have made an official papal visit to a synagogue, when he visited the Great Synagogue of Rome on 13 April 1986.\nThe Pope has said that Jews are \"our elder brothers.\" (see dual-covenant theology)\n\n\n== Auschwitz ==\nIn 1979 he became the first pope to visit the former German Auschwitz concentration camp in occupied Poland. On 13 April 1986 Pope John Paul II visited The Great Synagogue of Rome. The visit became the first known visit to a synagogue by a pope. He also visited the Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem in Israel in March 2000, and touched the holiest outward remaining shrine of the Jewish people, the Western Wall in Jerusalem. He placed in the Western Wall a prayer that read:\n\nGod of our fathers, you chose Abraham and his descendants to bring your name to the nations. We are deeply saddened by the behavior of those who, in the course of history, have caused these children of yours to suffer.\n\n\n== Dual-covenant theology ==\nJohn Paul II supported greater dialogue between Catholics and Jews, but did not explicitly support dual-covenant theology. On November 17, 1980, John Paul II delivered a speech in Mainz to Jewish communities in Germany in which he discussed his views of Catholic-Jewish relations. In it, John Paul II asserted that God's  covenant with the Jewish people was never revoked. During the speech, John Paul II cited the Guidelines for the Implementation of the [Second Vatican] Council Declaration Nostra Aetate, claiming that Catholics \"will endeavor to understand better all that in the Old Testament preserves a proper and perpetual value ..., since this value has not been obliterated by the further interpretation of the New Testament, which on the contrary gave the Older its most complete meaning, so that the New one receives from the Old light and explanation .\"\n\n\n== Relations with Israel ==\n\nIn 1994, John Paul II established formal diplomatic relations between the Holy See and the State of Israel, acknowledging its centrality in Jewish life and faith. In honour of this event, Pope John Paul II hosted The Papal Concert to Commemorate the Holocaust. This concert, which was conceived and conducted by American Maestro Gilbert Levine, was attended by the Chief  Rabbi of Rome, the President of Italy, and survivors of the Holocaust from around the world.\nThe Pope played a role in the 1990s peace negotiations in the hopes of finding a diplomatic solution between Israelis and Palestinians. However, the 1993 fundamental accord was not put into application during his papacy because of lingering problems over tax issues.\n\n\n== The issue of the Carmelite Nun convent at Auschwitz ==\nEfforts at reconciliation took a step back when the Polish national Catholic bishops conferences supported the Carmelite Nuns in their attempt to establish a convent at the former World War II Nazi-run death camp located at Auschwitz, a very sensitive site in the memorial to the victims of the Holocaust. The proposed location of this convent provoked hostility from some sectors of the Jewish community to the idea of building the Catholic institution on the ground where mass genocide of Jews was carried out. Jewish groups believed that this w\nThe early life of Karol J\u00f3zef Wojty\u0142a, the future Pope John Paul II, covers the period in his life from his birth in 1920 to his ordination to the priesthood in 1946.\n\n\n== Childhood ==\n\nKarol J\u00f3zef Wojty\u0142a (junior) was born on 18 May 1920 in Wadowice near the city of Krak\u00f3w in southern Poland, the youngest of three children.\nHis father was Karol J\u00f3zef Wojty\u0142a (senior), born on 18 July 1879 in Lipnik (now part of Bielsko-Bia\u0142a). He was a non-commissioned officer of the Austro-Hungarian Army and a captain in the Polish Army. Wojty\u0142a (senior) died, from what is believed to be a heart attack, on 18 February 1941 (Krak\u00f3w, Poland) while his son was away, and the fact is considered to have influenced his son's decision to join the seminary. Wojty\u0142a's (senior) parents were Anna (Przeczek) and Maciej Wojty\u0142a.\nHis mother was Emilia Wojty\u0142a, n\u00e9e Kaczorowska. She was born on 26 March 1884 in Bia\u0142a, Poland. Her parents were Anna Maria (Scholz) and Feliks Kaczorowski. Her name would later be given to a road tunnel built in Silesia, in March 2010 (Tunnel Emilia). She died of heart and kidney problems on 13 April 1929 in Wadowice, Poland. His only sister, Olga, died in infancy before Karol was born.\nAfter Emilia's death, his father, an intensely religious man who did most of the housework, brought up Karol so that he could study. As a child Karol was called Lolek by friends and family. He grew close to his brother Edmund, whom Karol had nicknamed Mundek. Edmund graduated from the Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w and practised as a doctor in Bielsko. There was an epidemic of scarlet fever in the winter of 1932, and he contracted the disease from one of his patients. Edmund died four days later, on 5 December, aged 26; Karol, now 12, was profoundly affected. He reflected on this fifty years later, in a speech he made at the Jagiellonian University: \"These are events that became deeply engraved in my memory, my brother's death perhaps even deeper than my mother's death\u2014equally because of the special circumstances, one may say tragic ones, and in view of my greater maturity at the time.\" On Thursday, 10 October 2019, the Polish Episcopal Conference formally announced that they would petition the Holy See for permission to begin the cause for beatification and canonization of Karol Sr. and Emilia at the local level, in the Archdiocese of Krak\u00f3w. If Pope Francis, through the Cardinal Prefect and the voting cardinal and bishop members of the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints, agrees, the couple would be named \"Servants of God\", the first stage. If they are then found to have lived a life of heroic virtue, they can be called \"Venerable\". After that, a miracle, usually medical in nature, must be proven for them to be beatified, and then another for canonization, unless a requirement is waived by the Pope.   \nKarol's youth was influenced by numerous contacts with the vibrant and prospering Jewish community of Wadowice. He often played football, as a goalkeeper, and was a supporter of Polish club Cracovia and Spanish club FC Barcelona. School football games were often organised between teams of Jews and Catholics, and due to the anti-Jewish feelings of the time, there was a potential for events to sometimes turn \"nasty\". Karol, however, cheerfully offered himself as a substitute goalkeeper on the Jewish side if they were short of players.\nIt was around this time that the young Karol had his first serious relationship with a girl. He became close to a girl called Ginka Beer, described as \"a Jewish beauty, with stupendous eyes and jet black hair, slender, a superb actress.\"\nIn high school, he joined and soon became president of The Society of Mary (a lay society, not to be confused with the Marianists).\nPapal biographer George Weigel recalls that when Karol was around 15 years old, a young person playfully pointed a gun at him not realising that it was loaded. On pressing the trigger, the gun fired and narrowly missed the target. He would escape \nThe Palazzo Venezia or Palazzo Barbo (Italian: [pa\u02c8lattso ve\u02c8n\u025bttsja]), formerly \"'Palace of Saint Mark'\", is a large early Renaissance palace in central Rome, Italy, situated to the north of the Capitoline Hill. Today the property of the Republic of Italy it houses the National Museum of the Palazzo Venezia. The main (eastern) facade measures 77 metres (253 ft) in length, with a height (excluding tower) of about 31 metres (102 ft). The north wing, containing the \"Cibo Apartment\", extending westwards, measures 122 metres (400 ft) in length. It covers an area of 1.2 hectares (2.9 acres) and encloses two gardens and the Basilica of Saint Mark. It was built in the present form during the 1450s by Cardinal Pietro Barbo (1417-1471), titular holder of the Basilica of Saint Mark, who from 1464 ruled as Pope Paul II. Barbo, a Venetian by birth as was customary for cardinals of the Basilica of Saint Mark, lived there even as pope and amassed there a great collection of art and antiquities. During the first half of the 20th century it became the residence and headquarters of the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, who made notable orations from its balcony to huge crowds filling the Piazza Venezia.\nThe original structure of this great architectural complex consisted of a modest medieval house intended as the residence of the cardinals appointed as the titular holders of the Basilica of Saint Mark. In 1469, having undergone a massive extension, it became a papal residence and in 1564 Pope Pius IV, in order to win the sympathies of the Republic of Venice, of which the patron was Saint Mark, gave the mansion to the Venetian embassy to Rome on condition that part of the building would remain a residence for the cardinals of the Basilica of Saint Mark, which part is now known as the Cibo (or Cybo) Apartment, and that the Venetian Republic would provide for the building's maintenance and future restoration. The main eastern facade of the palace faces Piazza Venezia and the north wing, containing the Cibo Apartment, forms part of the south side of the Via del Plebiscito.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pope Paul II (Pietro Barbo) ===\n\nIt was rebuilt in 1451 when owned by Cardinal Pietro Barbo (1417-1471) who from 1464 ruled as Pope Paul II (1464-1471), a nephew of Pope Eugenius IV. It became a fortified building, composed of a half-basement and a mezzanine which functioned as a piano nobile. In 1455 Pietro Barbo had a commemorative medal struck to mark its construction. The building manifested some of the first Renaissance architectural features in Rome although the overall aspect is of a massive, fortified medieval structure with battlemented parapet. On its west side it adjoins the ancient Basilica of San Marco, which is aligned south to north, founded by Pope Marcus in 336 and dedicated to the Evangelist who would become protector of Venice, completely rebuilt in 833, and which underwent frequent reconstructions since then. Much of the stone to build the Palazzo was quarried from the nearby Colosseum, a common practice in Rome until the 18th century. The design is traditionally attributed to Leone Battista Alberti.\n\n\n==== Palazzetto ====\nBetween 1466-9 Pope Paul II added at the south-east corner a large square three storied cloister enclosing a garden, which structure was known as the \"Viridarium (\"Green Area\" / pleasure-garden) or \"Palazzetto (\"Little Palace\"). The building was completed after the pope's death in 1471 by his nephew Marco Barbo, Patriarch of Aquileia. This structure was demolished in 1910 and rebuilt on a similar scale and reusing many original materials, 100 metres to the west to fit in with the construction of the massive new Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II scheduled for completion in 1911.\n\n\n==== Biscia Tower ====\nThe large square tower above the south end of the main block was built \"circa 1470, and encloses a more modest mediaeval predecessor. It is known as the \"Torre della Biscia (\"Biscia Tower\" (\"Snake Tower\")) possibly after\nThe teachings of Pope John Paul II are contained in a number of documents. It has been said that these teachings will have a long-lasting influence on the Church.\nPope John Paul II's philosophical and theological teachings and writings were characterised by explorations in phenomenology and personalism. He was influenced by Hans Urs von Balthasar, Henri de Lubac, Yves Congar, Karl Rahner, his predecessors as Archbishop of Krak\u00f3w Eugeniusz Baziak and Adam Stefan Sapieha, and his predecessors as pope \u2013 John XXIII, Paul VI, and John Paul I. His closest theological adviser was Cardinal Ratzinger, who succeeded him as pope. Stanislaw Dziwisz was his personal secretary for forty years and one of his closest friends and advisers, and became Archbishop of Krak\u00f3w, John Paul's former post, and Cardinal. John Paul met regularly with the cardinal prefects and presidents of curial congregations and councils, and outlived many of them.\n\n\n== Catechism of the Catholic Church ==\nJohn Paul II published the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which became an international best-seller . Its purpose, according to the Pope's apostolic constitution Fidei Depositum was to be \"a statement of the Church's faith and of Catholic doctrine, attested to or illumined by Sacred Scripture, the Apostolic Tradition and the Church's Magisterium.\" He declared \"it to be a sure norm for teaching the faith\" to \"serve the renewal\" of the Church.[1]\n\n\n== Holiness and morality ==\nRight after being elected as pope, he told the cardinals who elected him that he saw that his main work was to implement the teachings of the Second Vatican Council, an important centrepiece of which is a universal call to holiness. This is the basis for his canonization of saints from all walks of life, as well as for establishing and supporting the personal prelature of Opus Dei, that teaches that everyone is called to holiness and that ordinary life is a path to sanctity.\nHis first encyclical letters focused on the Triune God; the very first was on Jesus the Redeemer (\"Redemptor hominis\"). He maintained this intellectual focus on God throughout his pontificate.\nIn The Splendor of Truth (\"Veritatis Splendor\"), a papal encyclical concerning morality, he emphasised the dependence of man on God and his law (\"Without the Creator, the creature disappears\") and the \"dependence of freedom on the truth.\" He said that man \"giving himself over to relativism and scepticism, goes off in search of an illusory freedom apart from truth itself.\"\n\n\n== Master plan for the new millennium ==\nIn his master plan for the new millennium, the apostolic letter At the beginning of the third millennium, (\"Novo Millennio Ineunte\") a \"program for all times\", he emphasised the importance of \"starting afresh from Christ\": \"No, we shall not be saved by a formula but by a Person.\" Thus, the first priority for the Church is holiness: \"All Christian faithful...are called to the fullness of the Christian life.\" Christians, he writes, contradict this when they \"settle for a life of mediocrity, marked by a minimalist ethic and a shallow religiosity.\" He highlighted \"the radical message of the gospels,\" whose demands should not be watered down. The \"training in holiness calls for a Christian life distinguished above all in the art of prayer.\"\nHis last encyclical is on the Holy Eucharist, which he says \"contains the Church's entire spiritual wealth: Christ himself.\" Building on his master plan further, he emphasised the need to \"rekindle amazement\" on the Eucharist and to \"contemplate the face of Christ.\"\n\n\n== Mariology ==\n\nJohn Paul II's strong Marian devotion was highly influenced by the Mariology of Saint Louis de Montfort. According to his apostolic letter Rosarium Virginis Mariae, the pontif's personal motto \"Totus Tuus\" was inspired by St. Louis' doctrine on total consecration to the Virgin Mary, which he quoted:\n\n\u201cOur entire perfection consists in being conformed, united and consecrated to Jesus Christ. Hence the most perfect o\nPope John Paul II entered the papacy in 1978 as an avid sportsman, enjoying hiking and swimming.  The 58-year-old was extremely healthy and active for his age, jogging in the Vatican gardens to the horror of Vatican staff, who informed him that his jogging could be seen by tourists climbing to the summit of the dome of St. Peter's Basilica. The pope's response, according to media reports, was \"so what?\"  When the cost of installing a swimming pool in his summer residence was queried by cardinals, John Paul joked that it was \"cheaper than another conclave\".\nJohn Paul's obvious physical fitness and looks earned much comment in the media following his election, which compared his health and trim figure to the poor health of John Paul I and Paul VI, the portliness of Pope John XXIII and the constant claims of ailments of Pius XII. The only modern pope with a keep-fit regime had been Pope Pius XI (r: 1922\u20131939) who was an avid mountain climber. An Irish Independent article in the 1980s labelled John Paul \"the keep-fit pope\".\nHowever, after over twenty-five years on the papal throne, two assassination attempts (one of which resulted in severe physical injury to the Pope), and a number of cancer scares, John Paul's physical health declined.\n\n\n== 1981 assassination attempt ==\n\nThe 1981 assassination attempt was costlier to his overall health than was generally known by the public at the time. Rushed to the Agostino Gemelli University Polyclinic to undergo emergency surgery, he experienced profound bleeding leading to a dangerous fall in blood pressure and to cardiac arrest, which was however successfully defibrillated. He received the Anointing of the Sick (formerly known as \"Last Rites\"). Despite difficulties with extensive blood transfusions, which are speculated to have transmitted cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, surgery was eventually successful. The bullet had passed completely through the body, puncturing the intestines and necessitating a colostomy. Seven weeks later, discussions were held about reversing the colostomy and eight of nine doctors voted against it, arguing the Pope was still too weak from the CMV infection. Saying \"I don't want to continue half dead and half alive\", the Pope effectively overruled his physicians and the reversal was done successfully on August 5, 1981.\n\n\n== Later years ==\nDespite the shooting and the complications during recovery, John Paul remained in good physical condition throughout the 1980s, and remained active as well. During the 1990s John Paul's health began to decline. A benign intestinal tumor was removed in 1992; he experienced two falls in 1993 and 1994 which dislocated his shoulder and broke his femur respectively; and he underwent an appendectomy in 1996. In December 1995, he had to suspend his urbi et orbi blessing on Christmas Day after a dizzy spell.\nAn orthopaedic surgeon confirmed in 2001 that Pope John Paul II was suffering from Parkinson's disease, as international observers had suspected for some time; this was acknowledged publicly by the Vatican in 2003. Despite difficulty speaking more than a few sentences at a time, trouble hearing and severe osteoarthrosis, he continued to tour the world, although rarely walking in public. Some of those who met him late in his life said that although physically he was in poor shape, mentally he remained fully alert.\nHowever, that claim was disputed by among others Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Mary McAleese, the President of Ireland, in their accounts of meetings with him in 2003. The Pope still showed no recognition. Papal critic John Cornwell claimed that, after Williams and his entourage left, the Pope turned to an aide and asked \"tell me, who were those people?\"\nAccording to Cornwell, Mary McAleese told the British Catholic newspaper The Universe of a visit as President of Ireland to John Paul where he struggled to talk about the Irish College in Rome, where Irish seminarians in the city are trained and to which \nPope John Paul II visited Ireland from Saturday, 29 September to Monday, 1 October 1979, the first trip to Ireland by a pope. Over 2.5 million people attended events in Dublin, Drogheda, Clonmacnoise, Galway, Knock, Limerick, and Maynooth. It was John Paul's third foreign visit as Pope, who had been elected in October 1978. The visit marked the centenary of the reputed apparitions at the Shrine of Knock in August 1879. The pope\u2019s visit to Ireland also took place, exactly over a month since Louis Mountbatten was killed in a boat bomb explosion over the coast of Sligo, planted by the Provisional IRA.\n\n\n== Visit ==\n\n\n=== 29 September (Saturday) ===\n\nAn Aer Lingus Boeing 747, named St Patrick, brought Pope John Paul II from Rome to Dublin Airport. The Pope kissed the ground as he disembarked.\n After being greeted by the President of Ireland Patrick Hillery, the Pope flew by helicopter to Phoenix Park where he celebrated Mass for 1,250,000 people, one third of the population of the Republic of Ireland.\nAfterwards, he travelled to Killineer, near Drogheda, where he led a Liturgy of the Word for 300,000 people, many from Northern Ireland. There the Pope appealed to the men of violence: \"on my knees, I beg you to turn away from the path of violence and return to the ways of peace\".\nThe Pope had hoped to visit Armagh, but the security situation in Northern Ireland rendered it impossible. Drogheda was selected as an alternative venue as it is situated in the Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh.\nReturning to Dublin that evening, the Pope was greeted by 750,000 people as he travelled in an open top popemobile through the city centre and visited \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in, the residence of the Irish President. His final engagement was a meeting with journalists at the Dominican Convent in Cabra. The journalists from the international media broke into a spontaneous rendition of 'For he's a jolly good fellow' when the Pope arrived. Pope John Paul spent the night at the nearby Apostolic Nunciature on the Navan Road in Cabra.\n\n\n=== 30 September (Sunday) ===\n \nPope John Paul began the second day of his tour with a short visit to the ancient monastery at Clonmacnoise in County Offaly. With 20,000 in attendance, he spoke of how the ruins were \"still charged with a great mission\". Later that morning he celebrated a Youth Mass for 300,000 at Ballybrit Racecourse in Galway. It was here that the Pope uttered perhaps the most memorable line of his visit: \"Young people of Ireland, I love you\". That afternoon, he travelled by helicopter to Knock Shrine in County Mayo which he described as \"the goal of my journey to Ireland\". The outdoor Mass at the shrine was attended by 450,000. The Pope met with the sick and elevated the church to the title of Basilica. He lit a candle at the Gable Wall for the families of Ireland. Monsignor James Horan, instrumental in the shrine's development, welcomed the Pope to Knock.\n\n\n=== 1 October (Monday) ===\n\nThe final day of the visit began with a brief early morning visit to St Patrick's College, Maynooth, the National Seminary, in County Kildare. Some 80,000 people joined 1,000 seminarians on the grounds of the college for the brief visit. A dense fog delayed the Pope's arrival from Dublin by helicopter. The final Mass of the Pope's visit to Ireland was celebrated at Greenpark Racecourse in Limerick before 400,000 people, many more than had been expected. The Mass was offered for the people of Munster. Pope John Paul left Ireland from nearby Shannon Airport travelling to Boston where he began a six-day tour of the United States.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n\n=== Speeches and homilies ===\nPope John Paul delivered 22 homilies and addresses during the course of this visit, including a televised message for the sick broadcast on RT\u00c9 on the evening of his arrival in Ireland. Audio files of his more significant speeches are preserved on the website of the Irish Catholic Bishops Conference.\n\n\n=== Auction ===\nMany of the temporary fixtures and ornament", "metadata": {"title": "Pope Paul II", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Paul_II"}}
