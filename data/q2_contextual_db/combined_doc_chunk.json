        "content": "The United States Capitol, often called the Capitol or the Capitol Building, is the seat of the United States Congress, the legislative branch of the federal government. It is located on Capitol Hill at the eastern end of the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Although no longer at the geographic center of the national capital, the U.S. Capitol forms the origin point for the street-numbering system of the district as well as its four quadrants. Like the principal buildings of the executive and judicial branches, the Capitol is built in a neoclassical style and has a white exterior.\nCentral sections of the present building were completed in 1800. These were partly destroyed in the 1814 Burning of Washington, then were fully restored within five years. The building was enlarged in the 1850s by extending the wings for the chambers for the bicameral legislature, the House of Representatives in the south wing and the Senate in the north wing. The massive dome was completed around 1866 just after the American Civil War. The east front portico was extended in 1958. The building's Visitors Center was opened in the early 21st century.\nBoth its east and west elevations are formally referred to as fronts, although only the east front was intended for the reception of visitors and dignitaries, while the west front is now used for presidential inauguration ceremonies. The building and grounds are overseen by the architect of the Capitol, who also oversees the surrounding Capitol Complex.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\n\nPrior to establishing the nation's capital in Washington, D.C., the United States Congress and its predecessors met at Independence Hall and Congress Hall in Philadelphia, Federal Hall in New York City, and five additional locations: York, Pennsylvania, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, the Maryland State House in Annapolis, Maryland, and Nassau Hall in Princeton, New Jersey, and Trenton, New Jersey. In September 1774, the First Continental Congress brought together delegates from the colonies in Philadelphia, followed by the Second Continental Congress, which met from May 1775 to March 1781.\nAfter adopting the Articles of Confederation in York, Pennsylvania, the Congress of the Confederation was formed and convened in Philadelphia from March 1781 until June 1783, when a mob of angry soldiers converged upon Independence Hall, demanding payment for their service during the American Revolutionary War. Congress requested that John Dickinson, the Governor of Pennsylvania, call up the militia to defend Congress from attacks by the protesters. In what became known as the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, Dickinson sympathized with the protesters and refused to remove them from Philadelphia. As a result, Congress was forced to flee to Princeton, New Jersey, on June 21, 1783, and met in Annapolis, Maryland, and Trenton, New Jersey, before ending up in New York City.\nThe U.S. Congress was established upon ratification of the U.S. Constitution and formally began on March 4, 1789. New York City remained home to Congress until July 1790, when the Residence Act was passed to pave the way for a permanent capital. The decision of where to locate the capital was contentious, but Alexander Hamilton helped broker a compromise in which the federal government would take on war debt incurred during the American Revolutionary War, in exchange for support from northern states for locating the capital along the Potomac River. As part of the legislation, Philadelphia was chosen as a temporary capital for ten years (until December 1800), until the nation's capital in Washington, D.C., would be ready.\nPierre L'Enfant was charged with creating the city plan for the new capital city and the major public buildings. The Congress House would be built on Jenkins Hill, now known as Capitol Hill, which L'Enfant described as a \"pedestal awaiting a monument.\" L'Enfant connected Congress House with the President's House via Pennsylvania Avenue with a width set at 160 f\nOn January 6, 2021, the United States Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., was attacked by a mob of supporters of then-U.S. President Donald Trump in an attempted self-coup d'état, two months after his defeat in the 2020 presidential election. They sought to keep him in power by preventing a joint session of Congress from counting the Electoral College votes to formalize the victory of President-elect Joe Biden. The attack was ultimately unsuccessful in preventing the certification of the election results. According to the bipartisan House select committee that investigated the incident, the attack was the culmination of a seven-part plan by Trump to overturn the election. Within 36 hours, six people died: one was shot by Capitol Police, another died of a drug overdose, three died of natural causes, and a police officer died after being assaulted by rioters. Many people were injured, including 174 police officers. Four officers who responded to the attack died by suicide within seven months. Damage caused by attackers exceeded $2.7 million.\nEncouraged by Trump, on January 5 and 6, thousands of his supporters gathered in Washington, D.C., to support his false claims that the 2020 election had been \"stolen by emboldened radical-left Democrats\", and to demand that then-Vice President Mike Pence and Congress reject Biden's victory. Starting at noon on January 6 at a \"Save America\" rally on the Ellipse, Trump gave a speech in which he repeated false claims of election irregularities and said, \"If you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\" As Congress began the electoral vote count, thousands of attendees, some armed, walked to the Capitol, and hundreds breached police perimeters. Among the rioters were leaders of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers militia groups.\nThe FBI estimates that between 2,000 and 2,500 people entered the Capitol Building during the attack, some of whom participated in vandalism and looting, including in the offices of then-House speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Congress members. Rioters also assaulted Capitol Police officers and reporters, and attempted to capture and harm lawmakers. A gallows was erected west of the Capitol, with rioters chanting to \"Hang Mike Pence\" after he rejected calls to overturn the election results. With building security breached, Capitol Police evacuated and locked down both chambers of Congress and several buildings in the Complex. Rioters occupied the empty Senate chamber while federal law enforcement officers defended the evacuated House floor. Pipe bombs were found at both the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee headquarters, and Molotov cocktails were discovered in a vehicle near the Capitol. Trump resisted sending the National Guard to quell the mob. Later that afternoon in a Twitter video, he restated false claims about the election and told his supporters to \"go home in peace\". The Capitol was cleared of rioters by mid-evening, and the electoral vote count was resumed and completed by the early morning of January 7. Pence declared President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris victorious. Pressured by his cabinet, the threat of removal, and many resignations, Trump later conceded to an orderly transition of power in a televised statement.\nA week after the attack, the House of Representatives impeached Trump for incitement of insurrection, making him the only U.S. president to be impeached twice. In February, after Trump had left office, the Senate voted 57–43 in favor of conviction, but fell short of the required two-thirds, resulting in his acquittal. Senate Republicans blocked a bill to create a bipartisan independent commission to investigate the attack, so the House instead approved a select investigation committee. They held nine televised public hearings on the attack, voted to subpoena Trump, and recommended that the Department of Justice (DOJ) prosecute him. On August 1, 2023, following a specia\nThe United States Capitol Police (USCP) is a federal law enforcement agency in the United States with nationwide jurisdiction charged with protecting the United States Congress within the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its territories. It answers to the Capitol Police Board and is the only full-service federal law enforcement agency appointed by the legislative branch of the federal government of the United States.\nThe United States Capitol Police has the primary responsibility for protecting life and property, preventing, detecting, and investigating criminal acts, and enforcing traffic regulations throughout a complex of congressional buildings, parks, and thoroughfares. The Capitol Police has primary jurisdiction within buildings and grounds of the United States Capitol Complex. It also has concurrent jurisdiction with other law enforcement agencies, including the United States Park Police and the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia, in an area of approximately 200 blocks around the complex. Officers also have jurisdiction throughout the District of Columbia to take enforcement action when they observe or are made aware of crimes of violence while on official duties. \nAdditionally, they are charged with the protection of members of Congress, officers of Congress, and their families throughout the entire United States, its territories and possessions, and the District of Columbia. While performing protective functions, the Capitol Police have jurisdiction throughout the entire United States. It is informally considered as the sister agency of the United States Secret Service, which itself is responsible for the protection of the United States President and their Cabinet.\n\n\n== Jurisdiction and budget ==\nIn the early 1980s, the protective mandates and jurisdictions of the U.S. Capitol Police were substantially expanded to allow them to protect legislators away from their normal jurisdictions in response to the growing risk and threats faced by legislators and the growing institutionalization of Congress.\nU.S. Code, Title 2, Chapter 29 defines the powers and duties of the U.S. Capitol Police. The U.S. Capitol Police has the authority to enforce the laws of the United States in any area of the United States and has the power to effect warrantless arrests for any offense against the United States committed in their presence, or for any felony cognizable under the laws of the United States upon probable cause, in the performance of their protective duties. Qualified members of the U.S. Capitol Police may also travel outside of the United States when performing security advisory and liaison functions for congressional travel.\nThe primary jurisdiction of the United States Capitol Police centers on the United States Capitol building in Washington, D.C., the adjacent congressional (House and Senate) offices, and the Library of Congress buildings. This primary jurisdiction is about 270 acres (0.42 sq mi; 1.1 km2), with about 58 acres (0.091 sq mi; 0.23 km2) being the Capitol grounds themselves.\nThe U.S. Capitol Police has also concurrent jurisdiction with the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), the U.S. Park Police, the U.S. Secret Service Uniformed Division, and others federal agencies to enforce District of Columbia laws, based upon cooperative agreements with MPD and the  Police Coordination Act covering local cooperation with 32 federal law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe U.S. Capitol Police also have extended jurisdiction over parts of Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest Washington D.C. The USCP provides protection detail to House and Senate leaders, other congressmen and -women depending on individual risk analysis, lawmakers' state and district offices (with the help of local police), and \"off-campus\" events such as presidential nominating conventions.\nFour congressional committees have statutory oversight. The authority of the Police Chief is, in many ways, r\nOn January 6, 2021, supporters of then-President Donald Trump attacked the U.S. Capitol Building, disrupting the joint session of Congress assembled to count electoral votes to formalize Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 United States Presidential Election. By the end of the month, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had opened more than 400 case files and issued more than 500 subpoenas and search warrants related to the riot. The FBI also created a website to solicit tips from the public specifically related to the riot and were especially assisted by the crowdsourced sleuthing group Sedition Hunters. By the end of 2021, 725 people had been charged with federal crimes. That number rose to 1,000 by the second anniversary of the attack, and to 1,200 by the third anniversary, at which point over 890 people had been found guilty of federal crimes. These federal cases are handled by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia (D.C.). State cases, of which there are fewer, are handled in the D.C. Superior Court.\nEarly on, the majority of charges filed against the rioters were for disorderly conduct and unlawful entry. Other charges include assault on law enforcement officers; trespassing; disrupting Congress; theft or other property crimes; weapons offenses; making threats; and conspiracy, including seditious conspiracy. Some criminal indictments are under seal.\nIn August 2023, Trump was indicted for his actions on and around January 6.\nSome convicted rioters received a sentencing enhancement. On March 1, 2024, a federal appeals court said the sentencing enhancement could not be used, which may require the resentencing of over 100 rioters.\nAlso in March 2024, Trump called felons serving jailtime for the attack \"hostages\" and pledged to \"free\" them if he were reelected in the 2024 United States presidential election. As of that month, 500 people had been sentenced to prison terms and 1,358 had been criminally charged.\n\n\n== Criminal investigations ==\nDays after the attack, D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said he was specifically looking at whether to charge Donald Trump Jr., Rudy Giuliani and Mo Brooks with inciting the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol Building, and indicated that he might consider charging Donald Trump when he has left office. Calls for Trump to be prosecuted for inciting the crowd to storm the Capitol Building also were made in the aftermath of the event. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said, \"We saw an unprecedented attack on our American democracy incited by the United States president. He must be held accountable. His constant and divisive rhetoric led to the abhorrent actions we saw today.\"\nOn January 7, 2021, Michael R. Sherwin, the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, said rioters could be charged with seditious conspiracy or insurrection. He further suggested that Trump could be investigated for comments he made to his supporters before they stormed the Capitol and that others who \"assisted or facilitated or played some ancillary role\" in the events could also be investigated. Former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe and inspector general David C. Williams stated Trump could face criminal charges for inciting the riot.\n\nHowever, at first, according to the Washington Post,\"Capitol Police had for the most part let the rioters walk away. The task of identifying the thousands of attackers — let alone building cases against them — fell to a Justice Department whose leadership was in transition.\nWilliam P. Barr had left his post as attorney general two weeks before the attack amid a growing rift with Trump. His successor, Jeffrey Rosen, held the office for less than a month, and Garland would not be sworn in until March 11. Biden’s pick to replace Sherwin as the U.S. attorney in D.C. would not take office for another 10 months.\"Legal experts have stated that charging Trump with incitement would be difficult under Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), the Supreme Court ruling which established tha\nThe United States Capitol features a dome situated above its rotunda. The dome is 288 feet (88 m) in height and 96 feet (29 m) in diameter. Designed by Thomas U. Walter, the fourth Architect of the Capitol, it was constructed between 1855 and 1866 at a cost of $1,047,291 (equivalent to $17.1 million in 2023). The Statue of Freedom tops the lantern on the dome, and the dome is centered over the origin on street maps of Washington, D.C.\nThe dome is not stone, but rather cast iron carefully painted to appear to be made of the same stone as the capitol building below. It is actually two domes, one inside the other, and the total weight is 9.1 million pounds (4,100 t). The dome's cast iron frame was supplied and constructed by the iron foundry Janes, Fowler, Kirtland & Co. in the Bronx, New York. The interior of the dome includes a detailed geometric and floral pattern of lightly colored plasterwork, with Brumidi's monumental ceiling fresco, The Apotheosis of Washington, appearing in the oculus at the top of the inner dome.\n\n\n== First dome ==\n\nThe origin of the first dome began with the Capitol design contest sponsored by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, at the behest of President George Washington, in 1792. The winner of the contest, Doctor William Thornton, called for a dome in his original design for the building. Most vividly, Thornton drew upon the Roman Pantheon for inspiration with the Neoclassical dome and associated portico.\nThornton's replacement, Benjamin Henry Latrobe, the second Architect of the Capitol, altered Thornton's design plan on the exterior by adding an octagonal drum to visually separate the bottom of the dome from the top of the building's pediment. The third Architect of the Capitol, Charles Bulfinch, altered the exterior profile of the plans still further by increasing the dome's height, which he later wrote was at the insistence of the President and Congress.\nIn 1822, Bulfinch requested funds for the construction of the center of the building, and President James Monroe signed off on an appropriation of $120,000. This included the building of a double-dome structure, a stone, brick, and wooden interior dome to rise 96 feet (29 m) above the rotunda floor (matching the dimensions of the Pantheon), and a wooden exterior dome covered in copper that would rise to 140 feet (43 m). Set at the crown of the exterior dome was an oculus 24 feet (7.3 m) wide, which provided illumination to the rotunda floor below. Bulfinch completed the project in 1823.\nFor more than two decades, the green copper dome of the Capitol greeted visitors to the nation's capitol, until the 1850s. Due to the growth of the United States and the expansion and addition of new states, the size of the U.S. Congress had grown accordingly and pushed the limits of the capacity of the Capitol. Under the guidance of the fourth Architect of the Capitol, Thomas U. Walter, extensions were built onto the north and south wings of the building. In the process, the new, longer building made the original Bulfinch dome appear aesthetically displeasing (and it had in any case been the object of much prior criticism). Congress, after lobbying by Walter and Montgomery C. Meigs, then the supervising engineer, passed legislation to build a bigger dome in 1855.\n\n\n== Second (current) dome ==\n\nThe current cast iron dome of the United States Capitol is the second dome to sit above the building. Plans began in May 1854 to build a new cast-iron dome for the United States Capitol, sold on the aesthetics of a new dome, as well as the utility of a fire-proof one. Influenced by the great domes of Europe, Walter paid particular attention to the Pantheon of Paris, St Paul's Cathedral in London and St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, as well as the more recent  Saint Isaac's Cathedral in Saint Petersburg, Russia, one of the first domes with an iron frame, by Auguste de Montferrand (1786–1858).  William Allen, Historian of the Capitol, described Walter's first design as\n\n... a t\nThe United States Capitol building features a central rotunda below the Capitol dome. Built between 1818 and 1824, the rotunda has been described as the Capitol's \"symbolic and physical heart\".\nThe rotunda is connected by corridors leading south to the House of Representatives and north to the Senate chambers. To the immediate south is the semi-circular National Statuary Hall, which was the House of Representatives chamber until 1857. To the northeast is the Old Senate Chamber, used by the Senate until 1859 and by the Supreme Court until 1935.\nThe rotunda is 96 feet (29 m) in diameter, rises 48 feet (15 m) to the top of its original walls and 180 feet 3 inches (54.94 m) to the canopy of the dome, and is usually visited daily by thousands of people. The space is a national showcase of art, and includes numerous historical paintings and sculptures. It is also used for ceremonial or public events authorized by concurrent resolution of both houses of congress, including the lying in state of honored dead.\n\n\n== Design and construction ==\n\n \n\nThe doctor and architect William Thornton was the winner of the contest to design the Capitol in 1793. Thornton had first conceived the idea of a central rotunda. However, due to lack of funds or resources, oft-interrupted construction, and the British attack on Washington during the War of 1812, work on the rotunda did not begin until 1818. The rotunda was completed in 1824 under Architect of the Capitol Charles Bulfinch, as part of a series of new buildings and projects in preparation for the final visit of Marquis de Lafayette in 1824. The rotunda was designed in the neoclassical style and was intended to evoke the design of the Pantheon.\nThe sandstone rotunda walls rise 48 feet (15 m) above the floor; everything above this—the Capitol dome–was designed in 1854 by Thomas U. Walter, the fourth Architect of the Capitol. Walter had also designed the Capitol's north and south extensions. Work on the dome began in 1856, and in 1859, Walter redesigned the rotunda to consist of an inner and outer dome, with a canopy suspended between them that would be visible through an oculus at the top of the inner dome. In 1862, Walter asked painter Constantino Brumidi to design \"a picture 65 feet (20 m) in diameter, painted in fresco, on the concave canopy over the eye of the New Dome of the U.S. Capitol\".  At this time, Brumidi may have added a watercolor canopy design over Walter's tentative 1859 sketch. The dome was being finished in the middle of the American Civil War and was constructed from fireproof cast iron. During the Civil War, the rotunda was used as a military hospital for Union soldiers. The dome was finally completed in 1866.\n\n\n=== The crypt ===\nOriginally the crypt had an open ceiling into the rotunda. Visitors can still see the holes in the stone circle that marked the rim of the open space in the rotunda floor. Underneath the floor of the crypt lies a tomb that was the intended burial place for George Washington but after a lengthy battle with his estate and the commonwealth of Virginia the plans for him to be buried in the crypt were abandoned.\n\n\n=== Renovation ===\n\nIn January 2013, the Architect of the Capitol announced a four-year, $10 million project to repair and conserve the Capitol Dome's exterior and the Capitol rotunda. The proposal required the stripping of lead paint from the interior of the dome, repair to the ironwork, repainting of the interior of the dome, rehabilitation of the interstitial space between the dome and rotunda, and installation of new lighting in the interstitial space and the rotunda. The dome and rotunda, which were last conserved in 1960, were showing significant signs of rust and disrepair. There was a danger that decorative ironwork could have fallen from the rotunda to the space below, and that weather-related problems could damage the artwork in the rotunda. Without immediate repair, safety netting was installed, temporarily blocking the rotunda's artwork\nThe following article is a broad timeline of the course of events surrounding the attack on the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, by rioters supporting United States President Donald Trump's attempts to overturn his defeat in the 2020 presidential election. Pro-Trump rioters stormed the United States Capitol after assembling on the Ellipse of the Capitol complex for a rally headlined as the \"Save America March\".\nAt the rally, Donald Trump Jr., Rudy Giuliani, and several Republican members of Congress addressed the crowd and repeated Donald Trump's false claims that electoral fraud affected the 2020 election outcome. In his hour-long speech, President Trump suggested marching towards the Capitol, assuring his audience he would be with them, to demand that Congress \"only count the electors who have been lawfully slated\", and \"peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard\". Towards his conclusion, he said \"we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\"\nThe demonstrations turned violent with attendees breaching multiple police perimeters; assaulting Capitol police officers; and occupying, vandalizing, and ransacking parts of the building for several hours. Four people died that day: rioter Ashli Babbitt was fatally shot by a Capitol Police officer; two died of heart conditions; another died of an amphetamine intoxication. The next day, Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick died after suffering two strokes, having been physically attacked and pepper sprayed during the riot.\nAll times are specified or approximated in Eastern Time, or UTC-5:00.\n\n\n== Preceding events ==\n\n\n=== July–October 2020 ===\nJuly 30: Trump casts skepticism on mail-in ballots at a press briefing. \"I don't want to see [a term like 'projected winner']...a week after November 3rd or a month or, frankly, with litigation and everything else that can happen, years. Years. Or you never even know who won the election,\" he says. He adds: \"I want an election and a result much, much more than you.\"\nSeptember 23: Asked at a press briefing if he’ll commit to a peaceful transfer of power, Trump responds: \"The ballots are a disaster…Get rid of the ballots and you’ll have a very — we’ll have a very peaceful — there won’t be a transfer, frankly. There’ll be a continuation. The ballots are out of control.\"\nSeptember 29: During a Presidential debate, Trump orders members of the Proud Boys to \"stand back and stand by.\" This direction by the President is well-received by the Proud Boys, and white nationalist men begin to join in record numbers. Their membership will triple by January 6.\nOctober 31: Steve Bannon explains to associates that Trump has a \"strategy\": \"What Trump's gonna do is just declare victory. Right? He's gonna declare victory. But that doesn't mean he's a winner. He's just gonna 'say' he's a winner.\"\n\n\n=== November 2020 ===\nNovember 3:\nElection Day.\nOn Election Night, 15–20 people in the White House move to the Green Room where Trump will wait for results.

He declares: \"We won't stand for it ... We'll be going to the US Supreme Court; we want all voting to stop. We don't want them to find any ballots at 4 in the morning, and add them to the list ...

These include the National Statuary Hall Collection and the Statue of Freedom among many others.\nThe westernmost part of the grounds is the Capitol Reflecting Pool, which reflects the Capitol and the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial.\nWith the exception of the Ford and O'Neill House Office Buildings, all House and Senate office buildings within the Capitol Complex are linked to the Capitol via an underground network of people movers or footpath tunnels.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nConstruction of the Capitol began in 1792. When built, it was the only existing building for the use by the nation's legislature. In addition to Congress, the building was also designed to house the Library of Congress, the Supreme Court, the district courts, and other offices.\nFollowing the completion of the building and as the nation grew, so did the size of the Congress. The Capitol and its grounds were enlarged accordingly, and by 1892 the building had reached essentially its present size and appearance (with the exception of the east front extension 1958–1962 and courtyard infill areas 1991–1993).\nEven with the enlargements, Congress eventually grew too big for the building and new facilities had to be constructed to meet the needs of the government. With the moving of the Library of Congress into its own building in 1897, and with the construction of new office buildings for the House and Senate in the early 20th century, the Capitol Complex was born.\nKnown simply as the \"House Office Building\" and \"Senate Office Building\" when they opened in 1908 and 1909, the Cannon House Office Building and Russell Senate Office Building became the first buildings solely for use as offices by the House of Representatives and the Senate. These new buildings were heated and provided with electricity by the new Capitol Power Plant which opened in 1910 and is still used today.\n\nThe 1930s was a decade of major construction within the growing Capitol Complex. In 1933 alone the U.S. Botanic Garden Conservatory, Director's residence, and Bartholdi Park were completed; the Senate Office Building's First Street wing, which had been omitted during construction for funding reasons, was added; and the Additional House Office Building (later named the Longworth House Office Building) was occupied. The Supreme Court at last found a permanent home when its own building was completed in 1935. The last building constructed within the complex in this decade was the Library of Congress Annex, now named the John Adams Building, which opened in 1939.\nWithin twenty years, attention returned to the need for more Congressional office space; this led to the construction of a second building for the Senate (now name\nThe 1954 United States Capitol shooting was an attack on March 1, 1954, by four Puerto Rican nationalists seeking to promote Puerto Rican independence from the United States. They fired 30 rounds from semi-automatic pistols onto the legislative floor from the Ladies' Gallery (a balcony for visitors) of the House of Representatives chamber within the United States Capitol. \nThe nationalists, identified as Lolita Lebrón, Rafael Cancel Miranda, Andres Figueroa Cordero, and Irvin Flores Rodríguez, unfurled a Puerto Rican flag and began shooting at Representatives in the 83rd Congress, who were debating an immigration bill. Five Representatives were wounded, one seriously, but all recovered. The assailants were arrested, tried successively in two federal courts and convicted. All received long consecutive sentences, amounting to life imprisonment. In 1978 and 1979, their sentences were commuted by President Jimmy Carter. All four returned to Puerto Rico.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Independence movement in Puerto Rico ===\n\nThe Puerto Rican Nationalist Party was founded on September 17, 1922, by people seeking independence. They contended that, as a matter of international law, the 1898 Treaty of Paris, ending the Spanish–American War, could not empower the Spanish to \"give\" what was no longer theirs, in light of the 1897 Carta de Autonomía (Spanish Charter of Autonomy), whereby the Spanish Empire released Puerto Rico from colonial rule, giving the island sovereignty. While the Nationalists and other political parties supported independence, some political parties supported autonomy for the island within a formal relationship with the United States.\nDuring this period of unrest, the electorate increasingly voted for the People's Democratic Party (PPD), which by 1940 controlled a majority in the legislature. It supported the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950 by the US Congress, which established Puerto Rico as an Estado Libre Asociado (\"Free Associated State\"), with some autonomy. The people could elect their own governor, from the ruling PPD party; a bicameral legislature was established, and executive functions similar to those of American states were developed. The US retained responsibility for defense and foreign treaties.\n\n\n=== Puerto Rican Nationalist Party response ===\n\nThe Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s were a call for independence against the US government. The party demanded the recognition of the 1897 Carta de Autonomía, and Puerto Rico's international sovereignty. It also repudiated the status of Estado Libre Asociado, established in 1950 by law, as continued colonialism.\n\nThe Nationalist president, Pedro Albizu Campos, ordered armed uprisings on October 30, 1950, in several towns, including Peñuelas, Mayagüez, Naranjito, Arecibo and Ponce. The most notable uprisings occurred in Utuado, Jayuya, and San Juan. They were suppressed by Puerto Rican forces, assisted by US forces.\nIn Utuado, police killed the insurgents after they attacked the station. In Jayuya, insurgents declared the \"Free Republic of Puerto Rico\" after taking control of the police station; they held the city for three days, until the U.S. sent bomber planes, artillery, Puerto Rican National Guard and Army troops to suppress the revolt. In San Juan, the Nationalists attacked the governor's residence, intending to assassinate the governor, Luis Muñoz Marín, but were unsuccessful.\n\nThe revolts resulted in many casualties: of the 28 dead, 16 were Nationalists, 7 were police officers, 1 a National Guardsman, and 4 were uninvolved civilians. Of the 49 wounded, 23 were police officers, 6 were National guardsmen, 9 were Nationalists, and 11 were uninvolved civilians.\nThe actions were not limited to Puerto Rico. Two Puerto Rican Nationalists, who were living in New York City at the time, planned to assassinate the US president, Harry S. Truman. On November 1, 1950, they attacked police and Secret Service to gain access to Blair House in Wa\nWashington's Tomb is an empty burial chamber two stories directly below the Rotunda of the United States Capitol building in Washington, DC. It was included in the original design of the building by William Thornton and intended to entomb the body of George Washington, the first President of the United States. The original design of the rotunda, and the Crypt beneath it, included a central glass floor allowing the public to view Washington's Tomb two floors below, but this was never implemented. \nWhen Washington died in 1799, the Capitol was still under construction. Both houses of Congress passed a resolution calling for Washington to be entombed in the Capitol upon its completion. His wife, Martha Washington, agreed to the plan despite the presence in her husband's will of a provision that he be buried at Mount Vernon. However, the original resolution was never carried out due to disputes over the specific design and cost of the tomb and the body was placed in a temporary tomb at Mount Vernon. Congress again attempted to resolve these issues in 1800, 1816, 1824, and 1829, when the Architect of the Capitol prepared plans for the tomb in anticipation of the approaching centennial of Washington's birth. \nCongress renewed its call to transfer the body to the Capitol in 1830, after an attempt to steal Washington's head in which the Mount Vernon tomb was vandalized and several of Washington's relatives' corpses desecrated in 1830. The current owner of the property, John Washington, decided to build a new, more secure tomb on the site instead.\nFormerly, the Lincoln Catafalque was stored and exhibited in the tomb.  It is kept, at present, in a specially constructed display area in the Exhibition Hall of the Capitol Visitor Center.\n\n\n== See also ==\nUnited States Capitol crypt\nList of burial places of presidents and vice presidents of the United States\n\n\n== References ==\nThe 1998 United States Capitol shooting occurred on July 24, 1998, when Russell Eugene Weston Jr. entered the Capitol and fatally shot United States Capitol Police officers Jacob Chestnut and Detective John Gibson.\nGibson died during surgery at MedStar Washington Hospital Center; Chestnut died at George Washington University Hospital. Weston's exact motives are unknown, but he had expressed strong distrust of the federal government of the United States; he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia six years before the attack. Weston was later charged on July 26 for the murder of two U.S. Capitol Police officers during the shooting rampage. As of July 2018, Weston remained in a mental institution.\n\n\n== Shooting ==\nOn the day of the shooting, Officer Chestnut and an unarmed civilian security aide were assigned to operate the X-ray machine and magnetometer at the Document Door entrance located on the East Front of the Capitol, which was open only to Members of Congress and their staff. Detective Gibson was assigned to the dignitary protection detail of then House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-TX) and was in his suite of offices near this door. Weston, armed with a .38 caliber Smith & Wesson six-shot revolver, entered the Document Door at 3:40 p.m. At the same time, Officer Chestnut was providing directions to a tourist and his son. Weston walked through the metal detector, setting off the alarm. Chestnut requested he go back through the detector. Weston suddenly produced the gun and without warning, shot Chestnut in the back of the head at point-blank range. At this time, Officer Douglas McMillan, normally working outside the Capitol, was nearby retrieving keys to get a wheelchair for a tourist. Officer McMillan immediately returned fire as Weston shot Chestnut, causing Weston to shoot toward McMillan, wounding him. Weston then ran away from McMillan, turning into the first nearby open door he found. McMillan could not shoot at Weston without risking hitting the many civilians in the immediate area. According to witnesses, Weston turned down a short corridor. He pushed through a door that led to a group of offices used by senior Republican representatives, including then-House Majority Whip Tom DeLay and Representative Dennis Hastert, future Speaker of the House and a close protégé of then Speaker Newt Gingrich.\nUpon hearing the gunfire, Detective Gibson, who was in plain clothes, told the office staff to hide under their desks. Weston entered the office and quickly shot Gibson. Mortally wounded, Gibson returned fire, shooting Weston four times. Two other officers arrested Weston in the same office.  Senator Bill Frist, a heart surgeon who had been presiding on the Senate floor just before the shooting, resuscitated the gunman and accompanied him to D.C. General Hospital.\nAngela Dickerson, a tourist, was grazed on her face and shoulder by shrapnel from a marble wall as McMillan's rounds impacted the wall while he was attempting to hit the fleeing Weston. She was treated for her injuries and released.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nOfficers Chestnut and Gibson were killed in the attack. Both officers received the tribute of lying in honor in the United States Capitol rotunda. They were the first police officers, and Chestnut was the first African American, to receive the honor.\nIn 1999, Weston was found incompetent to stand trial due to mental illness; he had a history of schizophrenia and had stopped taking his medication. A judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ordered that he be treated with antipsychotic medication without his consent in 2001, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the decision. In 2004, the court determined that Weston still was not competent to be tried, despite ongoing treatment, and suspended but did not dismiss the criminal charges against him. Weston was known to the United States Secret Service before the incident as a person who had threaten\nThe United States Capitol crypt is the large circular room filled with forty neoclassical Doric columns directly beneath the United States Capitol rotunda. It was built originally to support the rotunda as well as offer an entrance to Washington's Tomb. It currently serves as a museum and a repository for thirteen statues of the National Statuary Hall Collection.\n\n\n== Origin and construction ==\nThe crypt originated with the initial designs drawn up for the United States Capitol by William Thornton, which called for a rotunda to be placed between the two wings of the building. The room beneath the rotunda was therefore required to support the large space above it. However, construction did not begin on the central part of the Capitol, where the rotunda and the room beneath it were located, until after the War of 1812.\nConstruction on the Capitol itself began in 1793, when the first American President, George Washington, laid down the cornerstone to the north wing of the building. Upon the death of Washington in 1799, the designers of the Capitol went to Martha Washington and requested permission to build a tomb for her husband in the Capitol. She acquiesced to this request and plans were made to construct the tomb underneath the floor that supported the rotunda. This area was designated the crypt, as it would serve as the entry to the tomb.\n\nDelays wracked the construction efforts of the Capitol's builders, notably the interruption by the War of 1812, when all construction came to a halt. In August 1814, the British captured the city of Washington and set fire to the Capitol, nearly destroying the entire building. Thus, when construction recommenced after the war ended in 1815, it was initially to rebuild what had been lost to the fire.\nThe central section of the Capitol comprising the rotunda and the crypt was not completed until 1827 under the oversight of Architect of the Capitol Charles Bulfinch. However, plans to re-inter Washington in the Capitol fell apart when attempts were made to retrieve his body from Mount Vernon, the President's home, due to restrictions of Washington's will and refusal of the plantation's then owner, John Washington.\nA marble compass was set into the floor of the chamber to mark the point where the four quadrants of the District of Columbia meet.\n\n\n== Usage ==\nIn the late 1800s and early 1900s the crypt was used for bicycle parking.\nToday, the crypt serves as the main thoroughfare of the ground floor of the Capitol and is a stop for all Capitol Tours provided through the Capitol Visitor Center. The crypt also contains the Magna Carta Case, a gold case which held one of the copies of the Magna Carta when it was on loan to the United States for the Bicentennial celebration.\nThere are 12 (previously 13) statues from the National Statuary Hall Collection, representing the 13 original states, located in the crypt. They are:\n\nSamuel Adams from Massachusetts, marble, by Anne Whitney in 1876.\nBilly Graham from North Carolina, bronze, by Chas Fagan in 2024.\nJohn C.

Since that time, there have been many violent and dangerous incidents, including shootings, fistfights, bombings, poisonings and a major riot. \nThe first significant incident was an act of war. During the War of 1812, the building was burned and severely damaged by British military forces in 1814, and then rebuilt. Other incidents were motivated by insanity, racism, fanaticism, extremism and personal grudges, and affected the Capitol building itself and sometimes other parts of the United States Capitol Complex. This timeline also includes incidents in which violence at the Capitol was only threatened, yet sufficient to disrupt normal procedures. \n\n\n== 19th century ==\n\n\n=== August 24, 1814 ===\n\nDuring the War of 1812, British forces briefly took control of Washington on August 24, 1814. They set fires throughout the Capitol, and also burned the White House, the headquarters of both the War Department and the Treasury Department. Within the Capitol, British troops built bonfires in the chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives and the clerk's offices. They also set fires in the U.S. Supreme Court chamber and the Library of Congress, both of which were located in the Capitol at that time. The building had wooden floors and interior walls that helped spread the flames. Less than 24 hours later, a severe rainstorm put out the fires. Although the Capitol was gutted, the exterior stone walls survived, and the building was reconstructed and improved. It took five years until Congress reconvened at the Capitol. The attack was, at least in part, retaliation for American attacks in Canada, such as the Battle of York, which began on April 27, 1813, and that included the burning of the British colonial government buildings. Other US attacks included the Raid on Port Dover from May 14 to May 16, 1814; which included the burning of houses, flour mills, sawmills, distilleries, and barns. Reconstruction of the Capitol was planned and supervised by Benjamin Henry Latrobe, who was the second Architect of the Capitol.\n\n\n=== April 1828 ===\nAt a White House reception during the John Quincy Adams presidency, Russell Jarvis, an anti-Adams reporter for the Washington Daily Telegraph, a Jacksonian newspaper, asserted that President Adams had publicly insulted Mrs. Jarvis, although Adams had criticized Jarvis himself. Since the president was considered to be immune from a dueling challenge, Jarvis attempted to initiate a duel with John Adams II, the president's son and personal secretary, who had been at the reception. Jarvis's efforts to provoke a duel with the younger Adams led to a highly publicized fight in the Capitol Rotunda. Jarvis struck Adams in the face and pulled his hair and grabbed his nose. Adams disapproved of dueling and non-violently refused to retaliate. An investigating committee of the United States House of Representatives determined that Jarvis had initiated the attack, but took no other action against Jarvis. Adams was cross examined by a hostile House staffer and castigated in much of the popular press as a coward.  The incident led to the founding of the United States Capitol Police in response to a message from President Adams \"requesting that Congress provide funds to secure the way between the president's office and Congress so that future incidents could be prevented.\" The police force was established\nby a law passed on May 2, 1828.\n\n\n=== January 30, 1835 ===\n\nRichard Lawrence was a British immigrant working as a house painter in and around Washington. In the early 1830s, his mental health deteriorated severely. He became convinced that he was actually King Richard III of England, that the U.S. government owed him a large sum of money, and that President Andrew Jackson was withholding his money and preventing him from returning to England.\nLawrence began observing Jackso\nThe subway system of the United States Capitol Complex in Washington, D.C., consists of three underground electric people mover systems that connect the United States Capitol to several congressional office buildings – all of the Senate buildings and one of the House buildings.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe original subway line was built in 1909 to link the Russell Senate Office Building to the Capitol. In 1960, an operator-controlled monorail was installed for the Dirksen Senate Office Building. A two-car subway line connecting the Rayburn House Office Building to the Capitol was built in 1965. The Dirksen monorail, which had been extended to the Hart Senate Office Building in 1982, was replaced in 1993 by an automatic train.\n\n\n== Network ==\n\nOn the Senate side, two separate subway lines exist. The first is a crewed two-track system, with a single open-topped car operating on each track, connecting the Russell Senate Office Building and the Capitol. The other is a computer-controlled system with three enclosed trains of three cars each running on a 90-second schedule, connecting the Hart Senate Office Building, the Dirksen Senate Office Building, and the Capitol. The train cars are unpowered; the train is propelled by a track-side linear motor. This line has two parallel tracks for most of its length, but at the Hart and Capitol stations the tracks converge into one, with a single side platform. This allows easy return travel on the opposite track. The Dirksen station features a side platform for Capitol-bound trains and an island platform for Hart-bound trains. All three of these stations feature platform screen doors. A small maintenance spur is located adjacent to the Hart station. \nOn the House side, an older, crewed two-track system, with a single open-topped car operating on each track, shuttles passengers between the Rayburn House Office Building and the Capitol. The remaining four House office buildings are not serviced by the subway system; two (Cannon and Longworth) use a shared underground footpath tunnel while the other two (Ford and O'Neill) have no underground connection to the capitol.\nThe House and Senate subway systems do not terminate in the same location under the Capitol, but they are connected by a labyrinth of tunnels.\n\n\n== Security ==\n\nMembers of the public can travel on the trains — usually during a tour of the Capitol Complex — but must be escorted by a staff member with proper identification. During votes, the House subway is restricted to congressional members. The Russell subway is restricted to members and staff during Senate votes.\nSince the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, restrictions have been placed on visitors using the Senate subway between the Hart and Dirksen buildings.\n\n\n=== 1947 shooting ===\nSenator John W. Bricker was shot at as he entered the Capitol subway tunnel by former Capitol Police officer William Louis Kaiser on July 12, 1947. Bricker survived as the shots did not hit him.\n\n\n=== 2007 collision ===\nA collision occurred on October 2, 2007, in the Rayburn to Capitol subway line after a car failed to slow down when it reached the end of the track line.

As a result of the attack, the Capitol complex was locked down. Green was shot and later died at a hospital from the gunshot wounds.  Green shared extremist viewpoints advanced by the Nation of Islam and other black nationalists prior to committing his attack at the Capitol.\n\n\n== Incident ==\nOn April 2, Officer Billy Evans was posted at a checkpoint on Constitution Avenue usually used by senators and staff members on weekdays, about 100 yards (91 m) from the entrance of the building on the Senate side. At about 1:00 p.m., a man deliberately crashed a blue Nissan Altima into the barricade. The vehicle struck Evans and another officer; Evans was hospitalized and died from his injuries. After ramming the two officers, the driver exited the vehicle with a knife, lunged at officers, and ignored verbal commands before being shot by police. The perpetrator was arrested, hospitalized, and died of his wounds soon afterward.\nThe Capitol was placed on lockdown after the attack and staff were told to shelter in place, while members of the National Guard's Immediate Reaction Force mobilized near the checkpoint. The lockdown was lifted later that day.\n\n\n== Victim ==\n\nWilliam \"Billy\" Evans was the Capitol Police officer killed during the attack. He served for 18 years with the United States Capitol Police, and was a member of the first responder unit. He was the sixth Capitol Police officer to die in the line of duty since the force was created in 1828.\n\n\n== Perpetrator ==\n\n\n=== Early life and education ===\nThe assailant was Noah Green, age 25, who was born in Fairlea, West Virginia, into a family with ten children. He grew up in Covington, Virginia, in the southwestern part of the state and graduated from Alleghany High School. In high school, he played football and participated in track and field. He attended Glenville State College before transferring to Christopher Newport University (CNU) in Newport News, Virginia, where he was a defensive back on the football team.\n\n\n=== Years before the attack ===\nPeople who knew Green described him as athletic and popular in high school and college, but after he graduated from CNU, he became deeply paranoid, leaving family and friends concerned that his mental state was unraveling. A U.S. official said Green increasingly suffered delusions, paranoia, and suicidal thoughts.\nFamily and friends said Green believed people had drugged him with Xanax, leaving him with addiction and withdrawal symptoms. After moving into an apartment in Newport News, he reported hallucinations, headaches, heart palpitations, and suicidal thoughts. One day, admittedly inspired by drugs, he abruptly abandoned his apartment in Newport News and moved to Indianapolis. While there, he told his brother he believed his apartment was being broken into by intruders. His brother said he appeared to be mentally disturbed.\nGreen also wrote in Facebook posts shortly before the attack that \"these past few years have been tough, and these past few months have been tougher\" and that he had quit his job \"partly due to my afflictions\". He posted about the end times and the Antichrist. In a March 15 post, he encouraged \"everyone to study Revelations [recte Revelation], study the signs of end times, study who the best [recte beast] is, study who the anti-Christ is, study who the false prophet is, and study the created images during those times.\" Two days later, he made a post possibly referring to his claim of being drugged by teammates, blaming the drugging for steering him off the \"right track\".\nGreen became a follower of the Nation of Islam (NOI), a Black nationalist organization, and its leader Louis Farrakhan. On Facebook, he posted messages in support of the NOI, as well as speeches and articles by \nThe Architect of the Capitol is the federal agency responsible for the maintenance, operation, development, and preservation of the United States Capitol Complex. It is an agency of the legislative branch of the federal government and is accountable to the United States Congress and the Supreme Court. Both the agency and the head of the agency are called \"Architect of the Capitol\". The head of the agency is appointed by a vote of a congressional commission for a ten-year term. Prior to 2024, the president of the United States appointed the Architect upon confirmation vote by the United States Senate, and was accountable to the president.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe agency had 2,444 employees and an annual budget of approximately $788 million as of September 2022.\nThe head of the agency sits on the Capitol Police Board, which has jurisdiction over the United States Capitol Police, and on the United States Capitol Guide Board, which has jurisdiction over the United States Capitol Guide Service.\nUntil 1989, the architect of the Capitol was appointed by the president of the United States for an indefinite term. Legislation in 1989 provides that the president appoints the architect for a term of ten years, with the advice and consent of the Senate, from a list of three candidates recommended by a congressional commission composed of the speaker of the House, president pro tem of the Senate, the majority and minority leaders of the House and Senate, and the chair and ranking members of the House Committee on House Administration, the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, and the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. On confirmation by the Senate, the architect becomes an official of the legislative branch as an officer and agent of Congress. The architect is eligible for reappointment after completion of the term.\n\n\n== Responsibility ==\n\nThe Architect of the Capitol is responsible to Congress and the Supreme Court for the maintenance, operation, development, and preservation of 17.4 million square feet (1,620,000 m2; 400 acres; 162 ha) of buildings and more than 553 acres (224 ha) of land throughout Capitol Hill.\nThe office is also responsible for the upkeep and improvement of the Capitol grounds, and the arrangement of inaugural ceremonies and other ceremonies held in the building or on the grounds.

It is located below the East Front of the Capitol and its plaza, between the Capitol building and 1st Street East. The complex contains 580,000 square feet (54,000 m2) of space below ground on three floors. The overall project's budget was $621 million.\nThe CVC has space for use by the Congress, including multiple new meeting and conference rooms. On the House side, there is a large room which will most likely be used by a committee. The new Congressional Auditorium, a 450-seat theater, is available for use by members of Congress or for either House of Congress should their respective chamber be unavailable.\nThe CVC officially opened on December 2, 2008. This date was selected to coincide with the 145th anniversary of placing Thomas Crawford's Statue of Freedom atop the Capitol building in 1863, signifying the completion of construction of its dome.\n\n\n== Design concept ==\nThe CVC contains three underground levels: a balcony level entrance, the Emancipation Hall (second) level and a third restricted level for new congressional offices and meeting rooms. The construction of the CVC represents the largest-ever expansion of the United States Capitol and more than doubles the footprint of the U.S. Capitol building complex.\nThe American Institute of Architects presented RTKL Associates Inc. with the Award of Excellence in Historic Resources for their work on the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center. The award was presented at the Architecture Week Closing Party & Design Awards Gala on September 30, 2010, in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n== Construction history ==\n\nConstruction of the CVC was supervised by the Architect of the Capitol. That post was held by Alan Hantman, FAIA until his term expired on February 4, 2007; construction was then continued by then Acting Architect of the Capitol Stephen T. Ayers, AIA, LEED AP.\n\nThe ceremonial groundbreaking for the CVC took place on June 20, 2000. Although originally planned to be completed by January 2004, the final completion date (not including the Senate and House expansion space) was extended to December 2, 2008. The proposed cost was originally $71 million, but it has risen to $621 million. The CVC has caused controversy for being over budget and behind schedule. Much of this is blamed on the rising cost of fuel, post-9/11 security measures, and inclement weather. At a hearing on the CVC cost-overruns Representative Jack Kingston called it \"a monument to government inefficiency, ineptitude and excessiveness.\"\nThe first major construction contract, worth nearly $100 million, was awarded to Balfour Beatty (formerly Centex Construction), in the spring of 2002. This contract involved site demolition, slurry wall construction, excavation, construction of columns, installation of site utilities, construction of the concrete and structural steel, waterproofing, and construction of a new service tunnel. By July 2005, Balfour Beatty Construction completed all excavation and structural activities, and the roof deck covered the entire CVC structure.\nManhattan Construction Company was responsible for the build-out including, installation of electrical, mechanical and plumbing systems, coordination with existing Capitol building systems where the center connects within the Capitol building, and completion of the above-ground East Front Plaza, with related site work and security elements.\n\n\n== Operations and features ==\n\nThe space is mainly designed for use as a holding zone for visitors waiting to take tours of the Capitol. The number of annual visitors to the Capitol has tripled from 1,000,000 in 1970 to nearly 3,000,000 as of recent times, and it has become difficult to deal with the congestion caused by such crowds. In the past, visitors were required to line up on the Capitol's east stairs, some\nLaw enforcement mounted a response to the January 6 United States Capitol attack, initially failing to maintain security perimeters and protect parts of the building from being breached and occupied, but succeeding at protecting members of Congress, and subsequently, as reinforcements arrived, to secure the breached Capitol.\nThe United States Capitol Police (USCP) had not planned for a riot or attack. The Capitol Police Board – consisting of the Architect of the Capitol, the House Sergeant at Arms, and the Senate Sergeant at Arms – has the authority to request the National Guard to the Capitol but made the decision on January 3 not to do so. On January 6, USCP officers deployed without \"less lethal\" arms such as sting grenades. Department riot shields had been improperly stored, causing them to shatter upon impact. At 12:49 p.m., Capitol police responded to two bombs near the Capitol. Minutes later, rioters breached a police perimeter west of the Capitol building. By 2:12 p.m., rioters breached the Capitol building. Capitol and D.C. police then fought to protect Congress and restore order, while individuals at the Department of Defense waited over three hours to deploy the National Guard.\nCapitol Police Chief Sund first requested assistance from the D.C. National Guard (DCNG) at 1:49 p.m. At 2:22 p.m. D.C. officials also requested National Guard deployment in a conference call with Pentagon leaders. After DoD refused to send immediate assistance, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser contacted the Public Safety Secretary of Virginia, Brian Moran, who immediately dispatched Virginia State Police to the District. At 2:49 p.m., the Governor of Virginia activated all available assets including the Virginia National Guard to aid the U.S. Capitol; the authorization from DoD required for legal deployment was not granted. By 3:10 p.m., police from Fairfax County, Virginia, were dispatched to the District, and began arriving at 3:15 p.m.\nAt 4:22 p.m., Trump issued a video message on social media in which he repeated his claims of electoral fraud, praised his supporters and told them to \"go home\". By 4:24 p.m., a 12-man armed FBI SWAT team had arrived at the Capitol Complex.  Then-Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller finally approved deployment of the National Guard at 4:32 p.m. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, later told the House committee that investigated January 6 that Pence, not Trump, had requested the deployment of the National Guard.\nAt 5:02, about 150 soldiers of the DCNG departed the D.C. Armory; the contingent reached the Capitol complex and began support operations at 5:40. However, Capitol Police, D.C. Metropolitan Police, and other responding law enforcement resources successfully established a perimeter on the west side of the U.S. Capitol prior to the arrival of the DCNG. At 8:00 p.m., the U.S. Capitol Police declared the Capitol building to be secure.\nIn the wake of the attack, law enforcement and Defense leaders faced criticism and calls for resignations.\n\n\n== Intelligence predicting an attack on the Capitol ==\n\n\n=== DHS, FBI, and local law enforcement ===\n\nOn October 30, 2020, Joseph B. Maher, acting United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Undersecretary for Intelligence and Analysis issued an internal memo, writing that the department anticipates incidents of physical violence and civil unrest related to the period \"leading up to, including, and immediately following\" the election. In the same memo, Maher instituted limits on the dissemination of open-source intelligence reports on election-related security threats, citing \"sensitivities and complexities\" whereby \"Civil unrest and election- or voter-related issues often invoke U.S. Persons and First Amendment-protected activity\".\nOn November 9, 2020, an intelligence analyst at the FBI Hazardous Devices School (a training center of the Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI]) circulated an email—prompted by an analysis done by the SITE Intel\nMore than seventy countries and international organizations expressed their concerns over the January 6 United States Capitol attack and condemned the violence, with some specifically condemning President Donald Trump's own role in inciting the attack. Foreign leaders, diplomats, politicians, and institutions expressed shock, outrage, and condemnation of the events. Multiple world leaders made a call for peace, describing the assault as \"an attack on democracy\". The leaders of some countries, including Brazil, Poland, and Hungary, declined to condemn the situation, and described it as an internal U.S. affair.\nAs early as January 2021, a few European security officials described the events as an attempted coup.\n\n\n== Sovereign states ==\n\n\n=== Africa ===\n Nigeria\nFormer President Goodluck Jonathan criticized Trump, saying that \"nobody's political ambition is worth the blood of any citizen, in any part of the world.\"\nFormer Vice President Atiku Abubakar said the events of January 6 were \"a lesson to be learnt: that strong institutions and not strong personalities are the bulwark of a rich democratic culture.\"\n South Africa\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa said he was \"shocked\", described it as having \"shook the foundations\" of American democracy, and \"wish[ed the United States] the best as they seek to bring stability to their own democracy.\" He also said South Africa was willing to help the United States using its own experience with a peaceful transition to democracy.\nFormer opposition leader Mmusi Maimane asked Americans to \"respect democracy, to respect rule of law and allow for a peaceful transition to power\" and advised them to \"follow the example of great democratic states like South Africa which respect outcomes of elections\".\n Uganda\nPresident Yoweri Museveni said the attack was \"not a good idea\" and compared it to protests held by opposition leader Bobi Wine, who was running against him in the 2021 Ugandan general election at the time, which Museveni described as a similar \"insurrection\".\nLabour Minister Frank Tumwebaze criticized Senator Marco Rubio's statement on the situation for describing the violence as \"3rd world style\". He said, \"So you are benchmarking 3rd world style? This rhetoric & double standard, God have mercy!\"\nGeneral Duties Minister Mary Karooro Okurut said, \"The Americans should not come here and try to teach us democracy because after US president Elect Joe Biden was declared, we saw protests everywhere even at Congress. Americans cannot come here to disorganize our peace.\"\n Zimbabwe – President Emmerson Mnangagwa called back to the fact that the Trump administration had \"extended painful economic sanctions placed on Zimbabwe, citing concerns about Zimbabwe's democracy ... yesterday's events showed that the U.S. has no moral right to punish another nation under the guise of upholding democracy.\"\n\n\n=== Asia ===\n India – Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted, \"Distressed to see news about rioting and violence in Washington DC. Orderly and peaceful transfer of power must continue. The democratic process cannot be allowed to be subverted through unlawful protests.\"\n Iran\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei mocked the situation, saying, \"Have you seen the situation in the U.S.? This is their democracy and this is their election fiasco. Today, the U.S. and 'American values' are ridiculed even by their friends.\"\nPresident Hassan Rouhani said Trump was a \"sick person\" who had caused problems for the world, and that the incident demonstrated the fragility of Western democracy. He claimed that the events show \"what a failure Western democracy is\" and how Trump, as a \"populist man\", has \"damaged the reputation of his country.\" He furthered that the incoming Biden administration should \"learn\" from America's \"populism\" and make up [for the past] and restore the country to a position worthy of the American nation ... for their own benefit and the good of the world.\"\n Israel\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that th\nThe January 6 United States Capitol attack was followed by political, legal, and social repercussions. The second impeachment of Donald Trump, who was charged for incitement of insurrection for his conduct, occurred on January 13. At the same time, Cabinet officials were pressured to invoke the 25th Amendment for removing Trump from office. Trump was subsequently acquitted in the Senate trial, which was held in February after Trump had already left office. The result was a 57–43 vote in favor of conviction, with every Democrat and seven Republicans voting to convict, but two-thirds of the Senate (67 votes) are required to convict. Many in the Trump administration resigned. Several large companies announced they were halting all political donations, and others have suspended funding the lawmakers who had objected to certifying Electoral College results. A bill was introduced to form an independent commission, similar to the 9/11 Commission, to investigate the events surrounding the attack; it passed the House but was blocked by Republicans in the Senate. The House then approved a House \"select committee\" to investigate the attack. In June, the Senate released the results of its own investigation of the attack. The event led to strong criticism of law enforcement agencies. Leading figures within the United States Capitol Police resigned.\nA large-scale criminal investigation was undertaken, with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) opening more than 1,200 case files. Federal law enforcement undertook a nationwide manhunt for the perpetrators, with arrests and indictments following within days. Over 890 people had been found guilty of federal crimes.\nTrump was suspended from various social media sites for his involvement in inciting the attack, at first temporarily and then indefinitely. In response to posts by Trump supporters in favor of the attempts to overturn the election, the social networking site Parler was shut down by its service providers. Corporate suspensions of other accounts and programs associated with participating groups also took place.\nThe inauguration week was marked by nationwide security concerns. Unprecedented security preparations for the inauguration of Joe Biden were undertaken, including the deployment of 25,000 National Guard members. In May, the House passed a $1.9 billion Capitol security bill in response to the attack. \nIn the days following the attack on the Capitol, Republican politicians in at least three states introduced legislation creating new prohibitions on protest activity.\nTrump has publicly embraced and celebrated the January 6 Capitol attack and has made it a cornerstone of his 2024 presidential campaign. Trump and elected officials within the Republican Party have since promoted a revisionist history of the event by downplaying the severity of the violence, spread conspiracy theories about the attack, called those charged \"hostages\" and portrayed them as martyrs.\n\n\n== Casualties ==\nThe deaths of five people who were present at the event have, to a varying degree, been related to it. A number of other people were injured, with severe injuries among members of law enforcement being documented.\n\n\n=== Deaths ===\n\n\n==== Ashli Babbitt ====\n\nAs lawmakers were being evacuated by Capitol Police, Ashli Elizabeth Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, attempted to climb through a shattered window in a barricaded door and was shot in the shoulder by Lt. Michael Leroy Byrd, dying from the wound. The shooting was recorded on several cameras. Capitol Police officers had been warned that many attackers were carrying concealed weapons, although a subsequent search revealed no weapons in Babbitt's possession. In the minutes before she was shot, the crowd had threatened police. A fellow rally attendee who was right near Babbitt recalled she had been warned not to proceed through the window: \"A number of police and Secret Service were saying 'Get back! Get down! Get out of the way!'; she didn't he\nThis is a list of state and territorial capitols in the United States, the building or complex of buildings from which the government of each U.S. state, the District of Columbia, and the organized territories of the United States, exercise its authority. While most states (39 of the 50) use the term \"capitol\" for their state's seat of government, Indiana and Ohio use the term \"Statehouse\" and eight states use \"State House\": Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Vermont. Delaware has a \"Legislative Hall\".  The State of Alabama has a State Capitol, but the Legislature has, since 1985, met in the State House.\nA capitol typically contains the meeting place for its state's legislature and offices for the state's governor, though this is not true for every state. The legislatures of Alabama, Nevada, and North Carolina meet in other nearby buildings, but their governor's offices remain in the capitol. The Arizona State Capitol is now strictly a museum and both the legislature and the governor's office are in nearby buildings. Only Arizona does not have its governor's office in the state capitol, though in Delaware, Ohio, Michigan, Vermont, and Virginia, the offices there are for ceremonial use only.\nIn nine states, the state's highest court also routinely meets in the capitol: Indiana, Kentucky, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma (both civil and criminal courts), Pennsylvania (one of three sites), South Dakota, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. The other 40 states have separate buildings for their supreme courts, though in Michigan, Minnesota, and Utah the high court also has ceremonial meetings at the capitol.\nMost U.S. capitol buildings are in the neoclassical style with a central dome, which are based on the U.S. Capitol, and are often in a park-like setting.\nEleven of the fifty state capitols do not feature a dome: Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, and Virginia.\nForty-four capitols are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, marked with NRHP. Nineteen of those are further designated as National Historic Landmarks, marked with NHL. \n\n\n== State capitols ==\n\n\n== Territorial and federal district capitols ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of capitals in the United States\nCherokee National Capitol\nChoctaw Nation Capitol\nChickasaw Nation Capitol\nCreek National Capitol\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nCupolas of Capitalism State Capitol Building Histories.

BuzzFeed has a searchable table of the plea deals.\nBy February 1, 2021, 228 people from 39 U.S. states and the District of Columbia (D.C.) had been charged with federal or D.C. offences or both. By early September, there were over 600 federal defendants, 10% of whom had pled guilty. By October 13, there were 100 guilty pleas. By the second anniversary of the attack, nearly 1,000 people had been federally charged. By August 2024, more than 1,400 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the attack and over 900 of them have been convicted.\nAccording to Politico, dozens of defendants \"deemed to be dangerous, flight risks or at high risk of obstructing justice were ordered held without bond. D.C. jail officials later determined that all Capitol detainees would be placed in so-called restrictive housing.\" Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized this decision, referring to it as solitary confinement, which she argued \"is a form of punishment that is cruel and psychologically damaging.\"\n\n\n== Groups of defendants ==\nJune 10, 2021 – The Los Angeles FBI Field Office arrested and charged six Southern California individuals in relation to the January 6 riots. Of the six individuals, three of them self-identified in Telegram chats as members of the Three Percenters. They are all charged with multiple felonies, including conspiracy, obstructing an official proceeding, and unlawful entry on restricted building or grounds. One of the charged, the former police chief of the city of La Habra, California, was charged with obstructing law enforcement during a civil disorder and unlawful possession of a dangerous weapon on Capitol grounds. Two members of the Three Percenters were additionally charged with tampering with documents or proceedings related to their deletion of Telegram chats and content to avoid detection by law enforcement. The six men, along with at least thirty others, were part of a private Telegram group which planned to attack the Capitol on January 6 and conspired to bring weapons.\nJune 11, 2021 – The FBI announced arrests and charges for three people, two from Minnesota and one from Iowa, who participated in the events on Jan 6. A man from Minneapolis, Minnesota, faced charges for his alleged actions of breaking through a police line and assaulting two Capitol police officers. According to his charging documents, the man posted photos of himself on Facebook and made claims that he was \"beating up cops\" while in Washington, D.C. A man from Austin, Minnesota, and his father, a resident of St. Ansgar, Iowa, were arrested without resistance and face charges related to participating in events inside the Capitol building.\nOctober 4, 2021 – Three men from Lindstrom, Minnesota, were charged with several federal counts for entering the Capitol building and assaulting police officers on January 6. They were among eight people in total from Minnesota charged in connection with the events.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCriminal proceedings in the January 6 United States Capitol attack\n\n\n== References ==",

In what became known as the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, Dickinson sympathized with the protesters and refused to remove them from Philadelphia.

The decision of where to locate the capital was contentious, but Alexander Hamilton helped broker a compromise in which the federal government would take on war debt incurred during the American Revolutionary War, in exchange for support from northern states for locating the capital along the Potomac River. As part of the legislation, Philadelphia was chosen as a temporary capital for ten years (until December 1800), until the nation's capital in Washington, D.C., would be ready."

All received long consecutive sentences, amounting to life imprisonment. In 1978 and 1979, their sentences were commuted by President Jimmy Carter. All four returned to Puerto Rico."

Upon the death of Washington in 1799, the designers of the Capitol went to Martha Washington and requested permission to build a tomb for her husband in the Capitol. She acquiesced to this request and plans were made to construct the tomb underneath the floor that supported the rotunda. This area was designated the crypt, as it would serve as the entry to the tomb."

Thus, when construction recommenced after the war ended in 1815, it was initially to rebuild what had been lost to the fire.\nThe central section of the Capitol comprising the rotunda and the crypt was not completed until 1827 under the oversight of Architect of the Capitol Charles Bulfinch. However, plans to re-inter Washington in the Capitol fell apart when attempts were made to retrieve his body from Mount Vernon, the President's home, due to restrictions of Washington's will and refusal of the plantation's then owner, John Washington.\nA marble compass was set into the floor of the chamber to mark the point where the four quadrants of the District of Columbia meet."

        "content": "Punxsutawney Phil () is a groundhog residing in Young Township near Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, United States, who is the central figure in Punxsutawney's annual Groundhog Day celebration.\n\n\n== Folklore ==\nOn February 2 each year, Punxsutawney holds a civic festival with music and food. During the ceremony, which begins well before the winter sunrise, Phil emerges from his temporary home on Gobbler's Knob, located in a rural area about 2 miles (3 km) southeast of the town. According to the tradition, if Phil sees his shadow and returns to his hole, he has predicted six more weeks of winter-like weather. If Phil does not see his shadow, he has predicted an \"early spring.\" Punxsutawney's event is the most famous of many Groundhog Day festivals held in the United States and Canada. The event formally began in 1887, although its roots go back even further.\nThe event is based upon a communal light-hearted suspension of disbelief which extends to the assertion that the same groundhog has been making predictions since the 19th century.\nThe event is organized by the \"Inner Circle\" – recognizable by their top hats and tuxedos – who ostensibly communicate with Phil to receive his prediction.\nThe vice president of the Inner Circle prepares two scrolls in advance of the actual ceremony, one proclaiming six more weeks of winter and one proclaiming an early spring. At daybreak on February 2, Punxsutawney Phil awakens from his burrow on Gobbler's Knob, is helped to the top of the stump by his handlers, and purportedly explains to the president of the Inner Circle, in a language known as \"Groundhogese\", whether he has seen his shadow. The president of the Inner Circle, the only person able to understand Groundhogese through his possession of an ancient acacia wood cane, then interprets Phil's message, and directs the vice president to read the proper scroll to the crowd gathered on Gobbler's Knob and the masses of \"phaithphil phollowers\" tuned in to live broadcasts around the world.\nThe Inner Circle scripts the Groundhog Day ceremonies in advance, with the Inner Circle deciding beforehand whether Phil will see his shadow. The Stormfax Almanac has made note of the weather conditions on each Groundhog Day since 1999; the almanac has recorded 12 incidents in a 20-year span in which the Inner Circle said the groundhog saw his shadow while the sky was cloudy or there was rain or snow coming down, and in one case said the groundhog did not see his shadow despite sunshine. Outside of Groundhog Day, Phil resides with a mate, Phyllis, at the Punxsutawney Memorial Library in a climate-controlled environment. In March 2024, the Inner Circle announced that Phil had sired two babies, the first time in the history of the event that such a siring had happened; the birth surprised the Inner Circle, which had assumed that groundhogs do not breed in captivity. As a result of the births, the family will move permanently to Gobblers Knob. The Inner Circle disowned the babies from ever inheriting their father's position.\n\n\n== Punxsutawney Phil canon ==\nThe practices and lore of Punxsutawney Phil's predictions are predicated on a light-hearted suspension of disbelief by those involved. According to the lore, there is only one Phil, and all other groundhogs are impostors. It is claimed that this one groundhog has lived to make weather prognostications since 1886, sustained by drinks of \"groundhog punch\" or \"elixir of life\" administered at the annual Groundhog Picnic in the fall. The lifespan of a groundhog in the wild is roughly six years.\nAccording to the Groundhog Club, Phil, after the prediction, speaks to the club president in the language of 'Groundhogese', which supposedly only the current president can understand, and then his prediction is translated and revealed to all.\nThe Groundhog Day celebration is rooted in Germanic tradition that says that if a hibernating animal casts a shadow on February 2, the Christian celebration of Candlemas, winter and cold we\nPunxsutawney (; Lenape: Punkwsutènay)\nis a borough in southern Jefferson County, Pennsylvania, United States. Punxsutawney is known for its annual Groundhog Day celebration held each February 2, during which thousands of attendees and international media outlets visit the town for an annual weather prediction by the groundhog Punxsutawney Phil. The actual prediction location, Gobbler's Knob, is in adjacent Young Township.\nThe borough, located 84 miles (135 km) northeast of Pittsburgh and 50 miles (80 km) northwest of Altoona, was incorporated in 1850. With a population of 5,962 in 2010, Punxsutawney is the largest incorporated municipality in Jefferson County.\n\n\n== History ==\nShawnee wigwam villages once occupied this site on the Mahoning Creek. The first settlement that included non-indigenous people was established in 1772, when Reverend John Ettwein, a Moravian Church missionary, arrived with a band of 241 christianized Lenape. Swarms of gnats plagued early settlers and their livestock for years, and are blamed for Ettwein's failure to establish a permanent settlement there. The clouds of biting gnats eventually drove the indigenous people away.\nThe indigenous people called the insects ponkies (living dust and ashes), and called their village Ponkis Utenink (land of the ponkies), from which the present name Punxsutawney evolved. One legend about the origin of the term ponkies concerned an old indigenous sorcerer-hermit who was said to have long terrorized indigenous people in the region. Eventually he was killed, his body burned, and his ashes were cast to the wind. According to the story, the ashes were transformed into minute living things that infested the swamp land. Another story about the source of the term asserted that the indigenous people compared the insect bites to burns caused by sparks or hot ashes.\nThe area was originally settled by the Lenape Indian tribe, and a more definitive source says the name Punxsutawney derives from a Native name in the Lenape language, Unami: Punkwsutènay, which translates to \"town of the sandflies\" or \"town of the mosquitoes\" (punkwës- 'mosquito' + -utènay 'town').\nAlternatively, the name is said to come from another Unami term, Put'schisk'tey, which means \"poison vine.\" The Shawnee and Delaware left Pennsylvania and had settled in Ohio by the end of the American Revolution.\nThe Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) Keystone Marker lists that Punxsutawney was founded in 1818. In 1840 it was reported that Punxsutawney was a village of about 15 or 20 dwellings. Settlers drawn by lumbering and coal mining eventually drained the swamps and exterminated the insects. The Borough of Punxsutawney was incorporated in 1850, and had a population of 256 at that time. \nIn 1907, the Punxsutawney and Claysville boroughs were consolidated and incorporated as Greater Punxsutawney, resulting in a combined population of 9,058 in 1910. A high-grade bituminous soft coal was mined in the surrounding region. Shortly after 1850, mining was being supplanted by factories which included brickworks, glassworks, tanneries, foundries, ironworks, machine shops, and wood planing, flour, feed, and silk mills. By the 1930s these were mostly gone, and townspeople were dependent largely on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad repair shops north of town, and a meat packing plant, in addition to the remaining coal mining and batteries of beehive coke ovens. \nIn 1900, 6,746 people lived in Punxsutawney before the consolidation with Claysville. After consolidation, the population in 1910 was 9,058; in 1920, 10,311; in 1930, 9,266; prewar in 1940, 9,482; and postwar in 1950, 8,969 people lived there. The population was 5,962 at the 2010 census.\nA groundhog known as Punxsutawney Phil is kept in nearby Young Township, and is said to predict the weather annually on Groundhog Day, February 2. The event provided the premise for the 1993 film Groundhog Day, although nearly all of the film was shot in Woodstock, Illinois.\nGroundhog Day (Pennsylvania German: Grund'sau dåk, Grundsaudaag, Grundsow Dawg, Murmeltiertag; Nova Scotia: Daks Day) is a tradition observed regionally in the United States and Canada on February 2 of every year. It derives from the Pennsylvania Dutch superstition that if a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day and sees its shadow, it will retreat to its den and winter will go on for six more weeks; if it does not see its shadow, spring will arrive early. In 2024, an early spring was predicted.\nWhile the tradition remains popular in the 21st century, studies have found no consistent association between a groundhog seeing its shadow and the subsequent arrival time of spring-like weather. The weather lore was brought from German-speaking areas where the badger (German: Dachs) is the forecasting animal, while in Hungary for example the bear serves the same purpose, and badgers were only watched when bears were not around. It is related to the lore that clear weather on the Christian festival of Candlemas forebodes a prolonged winter.\nThe Groundhog Day ceremony held at Punxsutawney in western Pennsylvania, centering on a semi-mythical groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil, has become the most frequently attended ceremony.  Grundsow Lodges in Pennsylvania Dutch Country in the southeastern part of the state observe the occasion as well. Other cities in the United States and Canada also have adopted the event.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe Pennsylvania Dutch were immigrants from German-speaking areas of Europe. The Germans had a tradition of marking Candlemas (February 2) as \"Badger Day\" (Dachstag), on which if a badger emerging from its den encountered a sunny day, thereby casting a shadow, it heralded four more weeks of winter.\n\n\n==== Germany ====\nCandlemas is a Western Christian festival observed in the Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches. In folk religion, various traditions superstitions continue to be linked with the holiday, although this was discouraged by the Reformed Churches in the 16th century. Notably, several traditions that are part of weather lore use the weather at Candlemas to predict the start of spring. The weather-predicting animal on Candlemas was usually the badger, although regionally, the animal was the bear or the fox.\nThe original weather-predicting animal in Germany had been the bear, another hibernating mammal, but when they grew scarce, the lore became altered. Similarity to the groundhog lore has been noted for the German formula: Sonnt sich der Dachs in der Lichtmeßwoche, so geht er auf vier Wochen wieder zu Loche (\"If the badger sunbathes during Candlemas-week, for four more weeks he will be back in his hole\"). A slight variant is found in a collection of weather lore (Bauernregeln, lit. \"farmers' rules\") printed in Austria in 1823.\n\n\n==== Groundhog as badger ====\nThe Pennsylvanians maintained the same tradition as the Germans on Groundhog Day, except that winter's spell would be prolonged for six weeks instead of four. For the Pennsylvania Dutch, the badger became the dox, which in Deitsch referred to \"groundhog\".\nThe standard term for \"groundhog\" was grun'daks (from German dachs), with the regional variant in York County being grundsau, a direct translation of the English name, according to a 19th-century book on the dialect. The form was a regional variant according to one 19th-century source. However, the weather superstition that begins Der zwet Hær'ning is Grund'sau dåk. Wânn di grundsau îr schâtte sent... (\"February second is Groundhog day. If the groundhog sees its shadow...\") is given as common to all fourteen counties in Dutch Pennsylvania Country, in a 1915 monograph.\nIn The Thomas R. Brendle Collection of Pennsylvania German Folklore, Brendle preserved the following lore from the local Pennsylvania German dialect:\n\nWann der Dachs sei Schadde seht im Lichtmess Marye, dann geht er widder in's Loch un beleibt noch sechs Woche drin. Wann Lichtmess Marye awwer drieb is, dann bleib\nGroundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy romantic comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin. Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. The film also features Stephen Tobolowsky, Brian Doyle-Murray, Marita Geraghty, Angela Paton, Rick Ducommun, Rick Overton, and Robin Duke in supporting roles.\nRubin conceived the outline of Groundhog Day in the early 1990s. He wrote it as a spec script to gain meetings with producers for other work. It eventually came to the attention of Ramis, who worked with Rubin to make his idea less dark in tone and more palatable to a general audience by enhancing the comedy. After being cast, Murray clashed with Ramis over the script; Murray wanted to focus on the philosophical elements, whereas Ramis concentrated on the comedic aspects. Principal photography took place from March to June 1992, almost entirely in Woodstock, Illinois. Filming was difficult, in part because of bitterly cold weather but also because of the ongoing conflict between Ramis and Murray.\nGroundhog Day was considered a box-office success on its release, earning over $105 million to become one of the highest-grossing films of 1993. It also received generally positive reviews. Reviewers were consistent in praise for the film's successful melding of highly sentimental and deeply cynical moments, and for the philosophical message beneath the comedy. It received multiple award nominations and won a BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay. For all its success, the film marked the end of Ramis's and Murray's long collaborative partnership, which had produced films like Caddyshack (1980) and Ghostbusters (1984). After filming ended, the pair did not speak to each other until shortly before Ramis's death in 2014. The film was a showcase for Murray; he had previously been seen primarily as a comic actor, and his performance led to more serious roles in critically acclaimed films.\nIn the years since its release, the film has grown in esteem; it is often considered to be among the greatest films of the 1990s and one of the greatest comedy movies ever. It has also had a significant effect on popular culture: the term Groundhog Day, meaning a monotonous, unpleasant, and repetitive situation, has become part of the English lexicon. Buddhist, Christian, and Jewish scholars have analyzed the film as a religious allegory. Groundhog Day is also credited with having ushered in mainstream acceptance of comedy films with fantasy-genre elements. In 2006, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry. Groundhog Day was adapted into a 2016 musical, and inspired a 2019 video game sequel, Groundhog Day: Like Father Like Son.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nOn February 1, television weatherman Phil Connors reassures his Pittsburgh viewers that an approaching blizzard will miss Western Pennsylvania. Alongside his new producer Rita Hanson and cameraman Larry, Phil travels to Punxsutawney for his annual coverage of the Groundhog Day festivities. He makes no secret of his contempt for the assignment, the small town, and the \"hicks\" who live there, asserting that he will soon be leaving his station for a new job.\n\nOn February 2, Phil awakens in the Cherry Street Inn to Sonny & Cher's \"I Got You Babe\" playing on the clock radio. He gives a half-hearted report on the groundhog Punxsutawney Phil and the festivities. Contrary to his prediction, the blizzard strikes the area, preventing all travel out of Punxsutawney, and although he desperately searches for a way to leave, he is forced to spend the night in the town.\nThe next morning, Phil wakes once more to \"I Got You Babe\" and the same DJ banter on the radio in his room at the Cherry Street Inn.

The county was established on March 26, 1804, from part of Lycoming County and later organized in 1830. It is named for President Thomas Jefferson. It is home to Punxsutawney Phil, the most famous groundhog that predicts when spring will come every February 2 on Groundhog Day. The county is part of the North Central Pennsylvania region of the state.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 657 square miles (1,700 km2), of which 652 square miles (1,690 km2) is land and 4.4 square miles (11 km2) (0.7%) is water. It has a warm-summer humid continental climate (Dfb) and average monthly temperatures in Brookville range from 24.8 °F in January to 68.8 °F in July, while in Punxsutawney they range from 25.7 °F in January to 69.6 °F in July.

Hogg, is a groundhog who resided in the Staten Island Zoo in Staten Island, New York City. He serves as the official groundhog meteorologist of New York City, who predicts the duration of winter each February 2 on Groundhog Day. The tradition dates back to 1981. He makes the prediction based on whether or not he sees his shadow during the ceremony between 7:00 A.M. and 7:30 A.M. on Groundhog Day. The ceremony at the zoo is sometimes attended and officiated by the Mayor of New York City. Chuck's prediction for 2024 was early spring, concurring with the prediction made by Punxsutawney Phil.\n\n\n== Notable moments ==\nStaten Island Chuck bit New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in 2009. Over his 12 years as mayor, Bloomberg attended 7 of 12 ceremonies.\nChuck was later replaced by his granddaughter, Charlotte, for the first Groundhog Day ceremony held during the mayoralty of Bill de Blasio. During that ceremony held on February 2, 2014, de Blasio dropped Charlotte onto the ground in front of \"shocked schoolchildren\". Charlotte died on February 9, 2014, although the Staten Island Zoo did not make this fact public until several months later. According to the New York Post, a necropsy attributed Charlotte's death to \"acute internal injuries\" consistent with a fall. Despite accusations of a coverup and reports that De Blasio had killed the groundhog, the zoo initially claimed that the animal died of natural causes, and later took the position that it was \"unlikely\" that Charlotte's death was caused by the fall.\nChuck's daughter, Charlotte Jr., served as a stand-in for him at Groundhog Day 2015.  On February 2, 2015, this female \"Staten Island Chuck\" walked out of a hutch that an elevator had lifted onto the stage of a portable Plexiglas habitat, while de Blasio watched from six feet (1.8 m) away. De Blasio did not attend the 2016 ceremonies, as he was in Iowa campaigning for Hillary Clinton's Presidential bid; Lieutenant Governor of New York Kathy Hochul officiated the groundhog ceremony in de Blasio's stead. He likewise did not attend the ceremony from 2017 to 2019, and in 2020 confirmed that he has no plans to ever return to the Groundhog Day Ceremony at the Staten Island Zoo: \"I tried it, it didn't end well, I won't be back,\" de Blasio said.\nIn 2017, Staten Island Chuck made his publication debut in the children's book Groundhog Chuck Builds a Weather Station. Authored by known animal lover and supporter of the outdoors, Staten Island's Deputy Borough President Ed Burke, the book follows Chuck and his zoo friends on an adventure to ensure the right weather forecast is always made.\n\n\n== Past predictions ==\nThe Staten Island Zoo has claimed that Chuck correctly predicted the duration of winter 26 out of 32 years as of 2013, an 82% success rate.\nEarly spring is defined as a spring in which a majority of days between Groundhog Day and the March equinox have a high temperature of over 40 °F (4 °C).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Staten Island Zoo where Chuck resides\nVideo of Staten Island Chuck biting Mayor Michael Bloomberg\nBite Lands Staten Island Chuck's Mug on Shirt\nThe groundhog (Marmota monax), also known as the woodchuck, is a rodent of the family Sciuridae, belonging to the group of large ground squirrels known as marmots. \nA lowland creature of North America, it is found through much of the Eastern United States, across Canada and into Alaska. \nIt was first scientifically described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758.\nThe groundhog plays an important role maintaining healthy soil in woodlands and plains; as such, the species is considered a crucial habitat engineer. The groundhog is an extremely intelligent animal, forming complex social networks and capable of understanding social behavior, forming kinship with its young, understanding and communicating threats through whistling, and working cooperatively to solve tasks such as burrowing.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nCommon names for the groundhog include chuck, wood-shock, groundpig, whistle-pig, whistler, thickwood badger, Canada marmot, monax, moonack, weenusk, red monk,: 300  land beaver, and, among French Canadians in eastern Canada, siffleux. The name \"thickwood badger\" was given in the Northwest to distinguish the animal from the prairie badger. Monax (Móonack) is an Algonquian name of the woodchuck, which means \"digger\" (cf. Lenape monachgeu).: 300–301  Young groundhogs may be called chucklings.: 66 \nThe etymology of the name woodchuck is unrelated to wood or any sense of chucking. It stems from an Algonquian (possibly Narragansett) name for the animal, wuchak. The similarity between the words has led to the popular tongue-twister:\n\nHow much wood would a woodchuck chuck\nif a woodchuck could chuck wood?\nA woodchuck would chuck all the wood he could\nif a woodchuck could chuck wood!\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe groundhog is by far the largest sciurid in its geographical range, except in British Columbia where its range may abut that of its somewhat larger cousin, the hoary marmot. Adults may measure from 41.8 to 68.5 cm (16+7⁄16 to 26+15⁄16 in) in total length, including a tail of 9.5 to 18.7 cm (3+3⁄4 to 7+3⁄8 in). Weights of adult groundhogs typically fall between 2 and 6.3 kg (4 lb 7 oz and 13 lb 14 oz).\nMale groundhogs are slightly larger than females on average and, like all marmots, they are considerably heavier during autumn (when engaged in autumn hyperphagia) than when they emerge from hibernation in spring. Adult males average year-around weight 3.83 kg (8 lb 7 oz), with spring to fall average weights of 3.1 to 5.07 kg (6 lb 13 oz to 11 lb 3 oz) while females average 3.53 kg (7 lb 13 oz), with spring to fall averages of 3.08 to 4.8 kg (6 lb 13 oz to 10 lb 9 oz). Seasonal weight changes reflect circannual deposition and use of fat. Groundhogs attain progressively higher weights each year for the first two or three years, after which weight plateaus.\nGroundhogs have four incisors, which grow 1.5 millimetres (1⁄16 in) per week. Constant usage wears them down by about that much each week. Unlike the incisors of many other rodents, the incisors of groundhogs are white to ivory-white.: 20  Groundhogs are well-adapted for digging, with powerful, short legs and broad, long claws. The groundhog's tail is shorter than that of other Sciuridae—only about one-fourth of body length.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThe groundhog dwells in lowland habitats, unlike other marmots that live in rocky and mountainous areas.  Marmota monax has a wide geographic range. The groundhog prefers open country and the edges of woodland, being rarely found far from a burrow entrance. It can typically be found in small woodlots, low-elevation forests, fields and pastures, and hedgerows. It constructs dens in well-drained soil, and most groundhogs have summer and winter dens. Human activity has increased food access and abundance, allowing M. monax to thrive.\n\n\n== Behavior ==\n\nW.J. Schoonmaker reports that groundhogs may hide when they see, smell, or hear an observer.: 41–43  Marmot researcher Ken Armitage states that the social biology of the groundhog is poorly studied.\nDe\nGeneral Beauregard Lee is a groundhog in the US state of Georgia widely considered to be the Groundhog Day weather prognosticator for the Southern United States.\nThe previous forecaster before General Beauregard Lee was General Robert E. Lee, who started making predictions in 1981. He was named after the American Confederate General of the same name. General Beauregard Lee's first nationally televised appearance was in 1988. General Beauregard Lee resided at Yellow River Game Ranch in Gwinnett County, Georgia for 27 years until the ranch suddenly closed in December 2017. He was then relocated to Dauset Trails Nature Center in Jackson, Georgia, to carry on his weather-predicting tradition. \nIn 2011, PolitiFact decreed General Lee to be more accurate than Punxsutawney Phil, boasting a 60% national accuracy for an early spring between the years of 2001 to 2010, compared to Phil's 30%. The groundhog-sized ante-bellum style mansion that General Lee lives in is known as Weathering Heights.\n\n\n== Past predictions ==\n\n\n== List of individual General Lee namesakes ==\nGeneral Robert E. Lee (1981-1991): This General Lee was considered to have had predicted the weather correctly nine out of ten times from 1981 to 1990. General Robert E. Lee retired in 1991 after he became too old and too fat. In February 1991, a commemorative marker was put on display at Yellow River Game Ranch in celebration of his retirement.\nGeneral Beauregard Lee (1991-): He was born in 1990 and was a distant relation of the previous General Lee. His namesake is an homage to Generals P. G. T. Beauregard and Robert E. Lee. In 1991, he and General Robert E. Lee shared the role of groundhog prognosticator at Yellow River Game Ranch, and the next year Beauregard Lee had his first solo role. He was considered to have gotten the prediction for 1993 wrong due the blizzard that hit the South that year.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial Bio\nBook entitled \"Groundhog Day\" by Don Yoder\nA top hat (also called a high hat, or, informally, a topper) is a tall, flat-crowned hat traditionally associated with formal wear in Western dress codes, meaning white tie, morning dress, or frock coat. Traditionally made of black silk or sometimes grey, the top hat emerged in Western fashion by the end of the 18th century. Although it declined by the time of the counterculture of the 1960s, it remains a formal fashion accessory. A collapsible variant of a top hat, developed in the 19th century, is known as an opera hat.\nPerhaps inspired by the early modern era capotain, higher-crowned dark felt hats with wide brims emerged as a country leisurewear fashion along with the Age of Revolution around the 1770s. Around the 1780s, the justaucorps was replaced by the previously casual frocks and dress coats. At the same time, the tricorne and bicorne hats were replaced by what became known as the top hat. By the 1790s, the directoire style dress coat with top hat was widely introduced as citywear for the upper and middle classes in all urban areas of the Western world. The justaucorps was replaced in all but the most formal court affairs. Around the turn of the 19th century, although for a few decades beaver hats were popular, black silk became the standard, sometimes varied by grey ones. While the dress coats were replaced by the frock coat from the 1840s as conventional formal daywear, top hats continued to be worn with frock coats as well as with what became known as formal evening wear white tie. Towards the end of the 19th century, whereas the white tie with black dress coat remained fixed, frock coats were gradually replaced by morning dress, along with top hats.\nAfter World War I, the 1920s saw widespread introduction of semi-formal black tie and informal wear suits that were worn with less formal hats such as bowler hats, homburgs, boaters and fedoras respectively, in established society. After World War II, white tie, morning dress and frock coats along with their counterpart, the top hat, started to become confined to high society, politics and international diplomacy. The last United States presidential inauguration with top hat was the inauguration of John F. Kennedy in 1961. Following the counterculture of the 1960s, its use declined further along with the disuse also of daily informal hats by men.\nYet, along with traditional formal wear, the top hat continues to be applicable for the most formal occasions, including weddings and funerals, in addition to certain audiences, balls, and horse racing events, such as the Royal Enclosure at Royal Ascot and the Queen's Stand of Epsom Derby. It also remains part of the formal dress of those occupying prominent positions in certain traditional British institutions, such as the Bank of England, certain City stock exchange officials, occasionally at the Law Courts and Lincoln's Inn, judges of the Chancery Division and King's Counsel, boy-choristers of King's College Choir, dressage horseback riders, and servants' or doormen's livery.\nAs part of traditional formal wear, in popular culture the top hat has sometimes been associated with the upper class, and used by satirists and social critics as a symbol of capitalism or the world of business, as with the Monopoly Man or Scrooge McDuck. The top hat also forms part of the traditional dress of Uncle Sam, a symbol of the United States, generally striped in red, white and blue. Furthermore, ever since the famous \"Pulling a Rabbit out of a Hat\" of Louis Comte in 1814, the top hat remains associated with hat tricks and stage magic costumes.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe top hat is also known as a beaver hat or silk hat, in reference to its material, as well as casually as chimney pot hat or stove pipe hat.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAccording to fashion historians, the top hat may have descended directly from the sugarloaf hat; otherwise it is difficult to establish provenance for its creation. Gentlemen began to replace the tricorne with the top hat at the end \nPhilip, also Phillip, is a male name, derived from the Greek Φίλιππος (Philippos, lit. \"horse-loving\" or \"fond of horses\"), from a compound of φίλος (philos, \"dear\", \"loved\", \"loving\") and ἵππος (hippos, \"horse\"). Prominent Philips who popularized the name include kings of Macedonia and one of the apostles of early Christianity.\nPhilip has many alternative spellings. One derivation often used as a surname is Phillips. The original Greek spelling includes two Ps as seen in Philippides and Philippos, which is possible due to the Greek endings following the two Ps. To end a word with such a double consonant—in Greek or in English—would, however, be incorrect. It has many diminutive (or even hypocoristic) forms including Phil, Philly, Phillie, Lip, and Pip.

The Punxsutawney Area School District encompasses approximately 295 square miles (760 km2). The townships of Banks and North Mahoning as well as a portion of Canoe Township are part of the district's boundaries in Indiana County. Jefferson County boroughs, including Punxsutawney, Worthville, Big Run, and Timblin, are served by the district as well. The townships of Bell, Gaskill, Young, Perry, Porter, Ringgold, Olver, McCalmont, and Henderson are also part of the district. According to the 2000 federal census data, the PASD serves a resident population of 22,055 people.\nThe Punxsutawney Area School District operates two schools. The Punxsutawney Area Elementary School is a K-6 building, and the Punxsutawney Area High School serves students in grades 7–12. Students may also attend Jefferson County-DuBois Area Vocational Technical School.\nSince Punxsutawney is home to the famous groundhog Punxsutawney Phil, the school mascot is the Punxsy Chucks; this name comes from \"woodchuck,\" which is another term for \"groundhog.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRiverview Intermediate Unit (IU) No. 6\nGroundhog Day is a musical with music and lyrics by Tim Minchin and a book by Danny Rubin. It is based on the 1993 film of the same name, which featured a screenplay co-written by Rubin.\nIt tells the story of Phil Connors, an arrogant Pittsburgh TV weatherman who, during an assignment covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, finds himself in a time loop, repeating the same day again and again.\nThe musical made its world premiere at The Old Vic in London in summer 2016 and was nominated for eight Laurence Olivier Awards in 2017, winning for Best New Musical and Best Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical for Andy Karl; it later opened on Broadway in 2017, and was nominated for seven Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Actor in a Leading Role in Musical for Karl.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe musical is based on the 1993 film Groundhog Day. The film itself starred Bill Murray as Phil Connors and Andie MacDowell as Rita Hanson and was produced on a budget of $14.6 million, earning over $70 million in domestic box office receipts. In 2006 it was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" It was voted at number 8 in the top ten greatest films in the fantasy genre by the American Film Institute in 2006.\nIn August 2003, Stephen Sondheim, when asked what his next project might be, said that he was interested in the idea of a musical adaption of Groundhog Day. However, in a 2008 live chat, he said that \"to make a musical of Groundhog Day would be to gild the lily. It cannot be improved.\" In 2009, during an interview with MTV News, Harold Ramis revealed that Danny Rubin was working on the book for a musical version of the film. Rubin affirmed he had been working on a concept of a Groundhog Day musical for some time, and already had about 12 song ideas (whittled down from 30) along with dialog, scenes, and other production aspects. Around 2012, Rubin had become stuck and felt it impossible he could make the musical happen as he believed he could not progress without the collaboration of a composer. Shortly after reaching this conclusion, Rubin was called by director Matthew Warchus to introduce him to Tim Minchin, who had just finished writing the songs for Matilda the Musical. Rubin felt Minchin's work in Matilda proved he \"can write songs that are funny and moving and smart and beautiful,\" and the three started working on adapting Rubin's book.\nThe trio formally announced their partnership towards the musical in January 2014. A workshop was held in London on 12 July, and Minchin performed an early version of a song from the show; \"Seeing You\", during his concerts at KOKO (December 2013 along with \"Night Will Come\"), Hyde Park (July 2014), the steps at Sydney Opera House (February 2015).\nOn 2 April 2015, the musical was officially confirmed and it was announced that the show would receive its Broadway premiere in March 2017. It was later announced the musical would make its world premiere during 2016 at The Old Vic theatre in London, as part of director Matthew Warchus' debut season as artistic director of the theatre.\nThe musical has a book by Danny Rubin, based on his original story, and the screenplay co-written with Harold Ramis, and is directed by Matthew Warchus, with choreography by Peter Darling and Ellen Kane and design by Rob Howell. The show features an original score and lyrics by Australian comedian and lyricist Tim Minchin. The production reunites most of the creative team behind the 2010 musical Matilda.\nSpeaking about the musical, director Warchus said that it's \"a show full of intellect, integrity and wit, insight, humor—and of course romance.\" Minchin, who wrote the music and lyrics for the adaptation, added, \"Our version of Groundhog Day is going to be both instantly recognisable, and utterly different\" and that \"The central conceit is perfectly suited to the theatre... it has the potential to be complex, dar\nIn philosophy, nihilism (; from Latin  nihil 'nothing') is any viewpoint, or a family of views, that rejects generally accepted or fundamental aspects of human existence, namely knowledge, morality, or meaning. There have been different nihilist positions, including that human values are baseless, that life is meaningless, that knowledge is impossible, or that some other highly regarded concepts are in fact meaningless or pointless. The term was popularized by Ivan Turgenev and more specifically by his character Bazarov in the novel Fathers and Sons. \nScholars of nihilism may regard it as merely a label that has been applied to various separate philosophies, or as a distinct historical concept arising out of nominalism, skepticism, and philosophical pessimism, as well as possibly out of Christianity itself. Contemporary understanding of the idea stems largely from the Nietzschean 'crisis of nihilism', from which derive the two central concepts: the destruction of higher values and the opposition to the affirmation of life. Definitions by philosophers such as Crosby (1998) and Deleuze (1962) focus on extreme critiques of nihilism like those asserted by Nietzsche. Earlier forms of nihilism, however, may be more selective in negating specific hegemonies of social, moral, political and aesthetic thought.\nThe term is sometimes used in association with anomie to explain the general mood of despair at a perceived pointlessness of existence or arbitrariness of human principles and social institutions. Nihilism has also been described as conspicuous in or constitutive of certain historical periods. For example, Jean Baudrillard and others have characterized postmodernity as a nihilistic epoch or mode of thought. Likewise, some theologians and religious figures have stated that postmodernity and many aspects of modernity represent nihilism by a negation of religious principles. Nihilism has, however, been widely ascribed to both religious and irreligious viewpoints.\nIn popular use, the term commonly refers to forms of existential nihilism, according to which life is without intrinsic value, meaning, or purpose. Other prominent positions within nihilism include the rejection of all normative and ethical views (§ Moral nihilism), the rejection of all social and political institutions (§ Political nihilism), the stance that no knowledge can or does exist (§ Epistemological nihilism), and a number of metaphysical positions, which assert that non-abstract objects do not exist (§ Metaphysical nihilism), that composite objects do not exist (§ Mereological nihilism), or even that life itself does not exist.\n\n\n== Etymology, terminology and definition ==\nThe etymological origin of nihilism is the Latin root word nihil, meaning 'nothing', which is similarly found in the related terms annihilate, meaning 'to bring to nothing', and nihility, meaning 'nothingness'. The term nihilism emerged in several places in Europe during the 18th century, notably in the German form Nihilismus, though was also in use during the Middle Ages to denote certain forms of heresy. The concept itself first took shape within Russian and German philosophy, which respectively represented the two major currents of discourse on nihilism prior to the 20th century. The term likely entered English from either the German Nihilismus, Late Latin nihilismus, or French nihilisme.\nEarly examples of the term's use are found in German publications. In 1733, German writer Friedrich Leberecht Goetz used it as a literary term in combination with noism (German: Neinismus). In the period surrounding the French Revolution, the term was also a pejorative for certain value-destructive trends of modernity, namely the negation of Christianity and European tradition in general. Nihilism first entered philosophical study within a discourse surrounding Kantian and post-Kantian philosophies, notably appearing in the writings of Swiss esotericist Jacob Hermann Obereit in 1787 and German philosopher Fri\nBuckeye Chuck, Ohio's official weather-predicting groundhog, resided in Marion, Ohio, US, until June 2023 and has resided at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History in Cleveland since then. He is one of two whistlepigs (another name for groundhogs) in Ohio known for predicting the arrival of spring on Groundhog Day (February 2). A native of Ohio, Chuck began predicting the arrival of spring in the 1970s. In addition, the Ohio General Assembly declared Buckeye Chuck the official State Groundhog in 1979. However, from 2006 to 2015, Chuck's forecast was correct only twice. \nAccording to the legend of Groundhog Day, the groundhog's behavior is a way of forecasting the weather. If the groundhog pops out from its burrow, sees his shadow, and then disappears again, it will mean that winter is to continue for six more weeks. But if the groundhog does not see its shadow, then it will not be scared to come out of its burrow and winter will soon end.\n\n\n== Past predictions ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nBalzac Billy\nFred la marmotte\nGeneral Beauregard Lee\nPunxsutawney Phil\nShubenacadie Sam\nStaten Island Chuck\nStormy Marmot\nWiarton Willie\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nohiohistorycentral.org - Ohio History Central: Buckeye Chuck\nFarmers' Almanac is an annual American periodical that has been in continuous publication since 1818. Published by Geiger of Lewiston, Maine, the Farmers' Almanac provides long-range weather predictions for both the U.S. and Canada. The periodical also provides calendars and articles on topics such as full moon dates, folklore, natural remedies, and the best days to do various outdoor activities.\nEach new year's edition is released at the end of August of the previous year and contains 16 months of weather predictions broken into 7 zones for the continental U.S., as well as seasonal weather maps for the winter and summer ahead.\nIn addition to the U.S. version, there is a Canadian Farmers' Almanac, an abbreviated \"Special Edition\" sold at Dollar General stores, and a Promotional Version that is sold to businesses as a marketing and public relations tool.\nThe publication follows in the heritage of American almanacs such as Benjamin Franklin’s Poor Richard's Almanack.\n\n\n== History ==\nFounded in 1818, the Farmers’ Almanac mixes a blend of long-range weather predictions, humor, fun facts, and advice on gardening, cooking, fishing, conservation, and other topics.\nThe Farmers’ Almanac has had seven editors. Poet, astronomer, and teacher David Young held the post for 34 years starting from when he and publisher Jacob Mann first founded The Almanac Publishing Company in Morristown, New Jersey. Following Young's death in 1852, astronomer Samuel Hart Wright became editor.\nIn 1933, Ray Geiger took over as the sixth editor of the Farmers’ Almanac and began what became the longest-running editorship in Farmers’ Almanac history.\nIn 1994, Ray's son Peter became editor. Sandi Duncan is now Managing Editor with him. Sandi was the first female editor in 178 years to hold an editorial position.\nIn 1997, an online version was created at FarmersAlmanac.com. The Almanac has over 1.2 million followers on Facebook, and is also on Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, TikTok and other social media sites.\n\n\n== Weather prediction ==\n\nPredictions for each edition are made as far as two years in advance. The U.S. retail edition of the Farmers' Almanac contains weather predictions for 7 U.S. climatic zones, defined by the publishers, in the continental United States, broken into 3-day intervals. Seasonal maps and summaries for each season are also shared in each new edition, as are forecasts for annual sporting events. Predictions cover 16 months, from the previous September (through December of the publication year).\nThe Farmers' Almanac will only state publicly that their method is an \"exclusive mathematical and astronomical formula, that relies on sunspot activity, tidal action, planetary position (astrology) and many other factors\". The Almanac's forecaster is referred to by the pseudonym Caleb Weatherbee. According to the publishers, the true identity of the forecaster is kept secret to prevent them from being \"badgered\".\n\n\n=== Accuracy ===\nPublishers claim that \"many longtime Almanac followers claim that their forecasts are 80% to 85% accurate\" on their website. Their website also contains a list of the many more \"famous\" weather predictions they have accurately forewarned of and like to point out that they have been predicting the weather longer than the National Weather Service.\nMost scientific analyses of the accuracy of Farmers' Almanac forecasts have shown a 50% rate of accuracy, which is higher than that of groundhog prognostication, a folklore method of forecasting. USA Today states that \"according to numerous media analyses neither the Old Farmer's Almanac nor the Farmers' Almanac gets it right\".\n\n\n== Notable articles ==\nMost editions of the Farmers' Almanac include a \"human crusade,\" advocating for a change in some accepted social practice or custom. Previous crusades have included: \"How Much Daylight Are We Really Saving,\" a recommendation for a revised Daylight Saving Time schedule (2007); \"Why is Good Service So Hard to Schedule,\" recommending th\nWilliam James Murray (born September 21, 1950) is an American actor and comedian, known for his deadpan delivery in roles ranging from studio comedies to independent dramas.\nMurray became a national presence on Saturday Night Live from 1977 to 1980, where he received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series. He established his stardom acting in a string of successful comedy films, including Meatballs (1979), Caddyshack (1980), Stripes (1981), Ghostbusters (1984), Ghostbusters II (1989), What About Bob? (1991) and Groundhog Day (1993). He also had supporting roles in Tootsie (1982), Little Shop of Horrors (1986), Ed Wood (1994), Kingpin (1996) and Osmosis Jones (2001).\nMurray began his collaboration with director Wes Anderson with Rushmore (1998), which earned him an Independent Spirit Award. He would continue to appear in many of his films, including The Royal Tenenbaums (2001), The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004), The Darjeeling Limited (2007), Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009), Moonrise Kingdom (2012), The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014), Isle of Dogs (2018) and The French Dispatch (2021). He starred in Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation (2003), earning him Golden Globe and BAFTA Awards as well as a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Other notable films roles include Broken Flowers (2005), City of Ember (2008), Hyde Park on Hudson (2012), The Monuments Men (2014), Rock the Kasbah (2015) and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023).\nFor his role in the HBO miniseries Olive Kitteridge (2014), he earned his second Primetime Emmy Award. Murray reprised his original Ghostbusters role of Peter Venkman in Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021) and Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire (2024).  In 2016, Murray was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMurray was born on September 21, 1950, in Evanston, Illinois, to Lucille, a mail room clerk, and Edward J. Murray, a lumber salesman. He attended an all-boys Jesuit school in Wilmette, Illinois, a northern suburb of Chicago.\nMurray and his eight siblings grew up in an Irish Catholic family. His paternal grandfather was from County Cork, while his maternal ancestors were from County Galway. Three of his siblings, John Murray, Joel Murray and Brian Doyle-Murray, are also actors. A sister, Nancy, is an Adrian Dominican nun in Michigan; she has traveled the United States in two one-woman programs, portraying Catherine of Siena and Dorothy Stang. His brother Ed Murray died in 2020. Their father died in 1967 at the age of 46 from complications of diabetes when Bill was 17.\nAs a youth, Murray read children's biographies of American heroes like Kit Carson, Wild Bill Hickok and Davy Crockett. He attended St. Joseph's grade school and Loyola Academy. During his teen years, he worked as a golf caddy to fund his education at the Jesuit high school, was the lead singer of a rock band (the Dutch Masters) and took part in high school and community theater. One of his sisters had polio and his mother suffered several miscarriages.\nAfter graduating from Loyola Academy, Murray attended Regis University in Denver, Colorado, taking pre-medical courses, but quickly dropped out and returned to Illinois.  In 2007, Regis awarded him an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree. On September 21, 1970, his 20th birthday, the police arrested Murray at Chicago's O'Hare Airport for trying to smuggle 10 lb (4.5 kg) of cannabis, which he had allegedly intended to sell. It was discovered after Murray joked to the passenger next to him that he had packed a bomb in his luggage. Murray was convicted and sentenced to probation.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 1970s: Early work ===\nSecond City, National Lampoon\nWith an invitation from his older brother Brian, Murray got his start at Chicago's The Second City, an improvisational comedy troupe, studying under Del Close. In 1974, he moved to New York City and was recruited by John Belushi as a featured player on The National Lampoon Radio Hour.\nAudio-Animatronics (also known as simply Animatronics, and sometimes shortened to AAs) is the registered trademark for a form of robotics animation created by Walt Disney Imagineering for shows and attractions at Disney theme parks, and subsequently expanded on and used by other companies. The robots move and often synchronise with audio by the assistance of an external sound system on the stage (generally a recorded speech or song). \nThe machines are usually fixed to whatever supports them. They can sit and stand but cannot produce any form of locomotion. An Audio-Animatronic significantly deviates from an android-type robot in that it uses prerecorded movements and sounds, rather than responding to external stimuli. In 2009, Disney debuted an interactive version of the technology called Autonomatronics, and in 2018, announced aerial stunt figures called Stuntronics.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAudio-Animatronics were originally a creation of Walt Disney employee Lee Adams, who worked as an electrician at the Burbank studio and was one of Disney's original Imagineers. Walt Disney got a mechanical toy bird in New Orleans, and he decided to improve the device that moved it. An early robotic figure was the Dancing Man, created by Roger Broggie and Wathel Rogers, and modeled after a tap dancing routine by actor Buddy Ebsen.  The system of the animatronics relies on a combination of electric motors, solenoids, hydraulic systems, pneumatic systems, and cables to produce repeatable puppet movements that syncs to sound.\nThe term \"Audio-Animatronics\" was first used commercially by Disney in 1961, was filed as a trademark in 1964, and was registered in 1967.\nDevelopment of the first audio animatronic technology began in 1949 with the work of the giant squid for 20,000 leagues under the sea (1954). \n\nThe Audio-Animatronic show The Enchanted Tiki Room opened in 1963 at Disneyland. It is a room full of tropical creatures with eye and facial actions synchronized to a musical score entirely by electromechanical means. The Audio-Animatronic cast of the musical revue uses tones recorded on tape to vibrate a metal reed that closes a circuit to trigger a relay, which sends a pulse of electricity to a mechanism that causes a pneumatic valve to move part of the figure.\nThe movements of the attraction's birds, flowers, and tiki idols are triggered by sound. Figures' movements have a neutral \"natural resting position\" that the limb or part returns to when there is no electric pulse present. Other than this, the animation is a binary system, with only on/off moves, such as an open or closed eye. The same kind of technology was used for the head of Mary Poppins robin cane in the 1964 movie. \nOther early Audio-Animatronics were at the 1964 New York World's Fair. They were used in the Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln exhibit at the State of Illinois Pavilion, Pepsi/UNICEF's \"it's a small world\" exhibit, General Electric's Carousel of Progress, and Ford Motor Company's \"Magic Skyway.\"\nAn Audio-Animatronic robin sang a duet with Julie Andrews in the 1964 film Mary Poppins.\n\n\n== Technology ==\n\nPneumatic actuators are powerful enough to move heavier objects like simulated limbs, while   hydraulics are used more for large figures. On/off type movement would cause an arm to be lifted (for example) either up over an animatronic’s head or down next to its body, but with no halting or change of speed in between. To create more realistic movement in large figures, an analog system was used. This gave the figures' body parts a fully fluid range of motion, rather than only two positions.\nTo permit a high degree of freedom, the control cylinders resemble typical miniature pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders, but mount the back of the cylinder on a ball joint and threaded rod. This ball joint permits the cylinders to float freely inside the frame, such as when the wrist joint rotates and flexes.\nThe oil-filled cylinders occasionally drip or leak, so it is sometimes necessary to do \nThe Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson is an American late-night talk show hosted by Scottish actor and comedian Craig Ferguson. This was the third iteration of the Late Late Show franchise, airing from January 3, 2005, to December 19, 2014. It followed the Late Show with David Letterman in the CBS late-night lineup, airing weekdays in the United States at 12:37 a.m. Taped in front of a live studio audience from Monday to Thursday (with two episodes taped on Thursdays) at CBS Television City in Los Angeles, California, directly above the Bob Barker Studio (Studio 33), it was produced by David Letterman's production company Worldwide Pants Incorporated and CBS Television Studios.\nThe Late Late Show franchise had previously aired as The Late Late Show with Tom Snyder, then as The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn. During the late 2004 transition of guest hosts following Craig Kilborn's departure, Craig Ferguson hosted a series of shows in October and November 2004, culminating in being announced on December 7, 2004, as the pick for new host. After launching The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on January 3, 2005, Craig Ferguson achieved the highest ratings since the show's inception in 1995. While quirky comedy was emphasized in the majority of the episodes, Ferguson also addressed difficult subject matters, such as the deaths of his parents, his struggles with alcoholism, and commenting on national tragedies such as the September 11 attacks. Ferguson undertook serious interviews, such as one with Archbishop Desmond Tutu, which earned the show a 2009 Peabody Award.\nDespite not initially having a sidekick, comedian and voice actor Josh Robert Thompson joined the show on April 5, 2010, and voiced Craig's sidekick Geoff Peterson, a robotic human skeleton. Often Geoff is referred to as a \"robot skeleton\", \"gay skeleton robot\" or \"gay robot skeleton\". Geoff is a radio-controlled animatronic robotic puppet skeleton with a metallic Mohawk hairstyle; he was designed and built by Grant Imahara of the TV show MythBusters. Geoff stayed as Craig's sidekick until the show's finale, after which Craig took Geoff home. Once Thompson began voicing Geoff Peterson, the format of the Late Late Show shifted from a more traditional formula (albeit with Ferguson's subversive humor) to a more loose, stripped-down and semi-improvisational comedy style in which Ferguson and Peterson would riff on various topics, often discarding prepared material and going over time limits.\nOn April 28, 2014, Ferguson announced that he would step down as host at the end of the year. The last episode aired on December 19, 2014. Afterwards, Late Late Show began a series of episodes with guest hosts; then the new permanent host James Corden began his iteration of the franchise on March 23, 2015.\n\n\n== Show format ==\n\nThe show often started with a cold opening that consisted of a short improvised monologue or commentary by Ferguson either as himself or involving his various puppets including Sid the Rabbit. Later openings of the show featured Ferguson talking or fighting with his \"Gay Robot Skeleton\" sidekick Geoff Peterson (voiced by Josh Robert Thompson), interacting with pantomime horse Secretariat, interrogating members of the studio audience, or presenting a musical number or a pre-taped sketch. The cold open was followed by the opening credits and a commercial break.\nFollowing the break and his introduction by announcer Shadoe Stevens, Ferguson began with \"Welcome to Los Angeles, California, welcome to the Late Late Show. I am your host, TV's Craig Ferguson. It's a great day for America, everybody!\" as he threw  pieces of candy to the audience and hit the side of the camera repeatedly. He then went into a free-form, largely ad-libbed monologue. After another commercial break, Ferguson was often seated behind his desk, where he'd ask Geoff \"WHAT TIME IS IT GEOFF PETERSON!?\" Mail theme songs then played, usually with the phrase \"Ass Mode\" in them as well as robots. Then\nShubenacadie Sam is a Canadian groundhog who lives at the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park in the town of Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia. Every February 2, on Groundhog Day, Sam's shadow is closely observed at 08:00 AST to make the traditional prediction whether there will be an early spring. Due to Nova Scotia's Atlantic Time Zone, Sam makes the first Groundhog Day prediction in North America.\nThe prediction ceremony draws an early-morning festive crowd of about 200 families and visitors to the wildlife park, sometimes heralded by a groundhog mascot, bagpiper and town crier. The wildlife park, usually only open on weekends in the winter, changes its seasonal hours to open especially for the annual ritual. Shubenacadie Sam predicted an early spring in 2024. \n\n\n== History ==\n\nNova Scotian Groundhog Day traditions arrived with German Foreign Protestant immigrants in the 1750s who settled around Lunenburg where the day was known as \"Daks Day\" (from the German dachs for badger) after the belief that badgers could predict the coming of spring on February 2.  The Shubenacadie Sam tradition at the wildlife park began about 1987 and differs from most other famous groundhogs as he is not woken from hibernation for Groundhog Day. By 2018, four ground hogs had served as \"Shubenacadie Sam\" since the practice began in Nova Scotia, as groundhogs usually live 10-15 years in captivity. In 2021, a 7-year-old female groundhog, \"Samantha\", assumed the prediction duties.  Park employees have served as the caretaker for Shubenacadie Sam and the park's groundhogs for over 20 years. They provide breakfast for the groundhog, usually yogurt and melon. Staff also read to the groundhog who has been designated an advocate for Family Literacy Day. Shubenacadie Sam inspired a children's book in 2022. Pages of the book are displayed around the park offering visitors a groundhog tour of the park. The ceremony was held virtually by web streaming during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 and 2022 but live gatherings resumed in 2023.\n\n\n== Biting incident ==\nIn 2018, Sam bit the finger of CBC reporter Brett Ruskin when the reporter grabbed the groundhog to stop Sam from climbing out of the groundhog enclosure.\n\n\n== Predictions ==\nShubenacadie Sam's prediction, like all weather-predicting groundhogs, bears little relation to seasonal weather trends as it is based on random location conditions, according to Meteorologist Cindy Day. Shubenacadie Sam has an accuracy rate of about 45%, according to Day, compared to 39% for Punxsutawney Phil and 25% for Wiarton Willie.\n\n\n== Background ==\nWhile Shubenacadie offers the earliest prediction every year, it is one of many towns throughout North America known for their winter-predicting groundhogs. The most famous is Punxsutawney Phil of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, United States. The most famous Canadian groundhog is Wiarton Willie in Ontario, Canada. Sam shares the Nova Scotia prediction every year with \"Two Rivers Tunnel\" in Cape Breton at the Two Rivers Wildlife Park  in Mira River, Nova Scotia, although \"Two Rivers Tunnel\" is awakened for its prediction just after 11 am instead of 8 am. Promoters of a lobster festival in Barrington Passage, Nova Scotia created a \"Lucy the Lobster\" ritual in 2018 with a lobster that crawled from the water to a lobster trap on Groundhog Day.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nShubenacadie Sam \"Groundhog\", Shubenacadie Provincial Wildlife Park website\nGus is the \"spokesgroundhog\" in more than 80 commercials for the instant scratch-off lottery games run by the Pennsylvania Lottery from 2004–2012 and 2015–present.\nThe original concept for Gus was created by MARC USA, an advertising agency based in Pittsburgh, PA. The concept was brought to life as an animatronic groundhog, created in 2004 by The Character Shop, Inc., a Hollywood creature effects company.\nGus is billed as the \"second most famous groundhog in Pennsylvania\", as a nod to Punxsutawney Phil.  His tag line is \"keep on scratchin'!\"\nGus appears in television commercials at the beginning of many months during the year and throughout the winter holiday season.  The spots air in all television markets in Pennsylvania, with overlap into portions of all of Pennsylvania's neighboring states where Pennsylvania television signals are available.  As of February 2011, the Pennsylvania Lottery claimed that Gus has appeared in more than 50 commercials.  In 2008, a girlfriend named Gabby was introduced to the Pennsylvania Lottery commercials, and the two were shown visiting the Pocono Mountains every Valentine's Day, as a nod to the importance of romantic tourism to that region's economy. Other \"family members\" have also appeared in commercials.\nGus required five puppeteers (Rick Lazzarini, Stephen R. Blandino, Debra Smith, Bob Mano, and Kacey Scappa) to operate.  One operated his head and body, one did his arms, one for his mouth and lip-sync, and another 2 for the rest of his facial movements.  His face was incredibly expressive, with dual axis ears, eyes up/down. eyes side/side, and blinks, 2-axis eyebrows, nose up/down, 2 axis jaw, smile, and 4 axis lip movement.  Due to Gus's small size, many of the servos needed to provide his animatronic functions are mounted externally, with the cables running through spring housings on their way up to his head.\nGus, with his lovable, wise-cracking personality, gained much popularity with Pennsylvanians; however, the Pennsylvania Lottery does not offer plush replicas of Gus for sale despite customer requests because it believes that such a toy would advertise the lottery (a game which is restricted to adult play) to children.\nGus has also appeared dressed in both Philadelphia Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers uniforms with other similarly uniformed men in a licensed co-branding with those two National Football League teams, as certain instant games are branded for those teams.\nOn February 22, 2012, the Pennsylvania Lottery announced that the campaign with Gus would be discontinued, so they could focus on a new campaign explaining how the PA Lottery benefits older Pennsylvanians, but after a nearly four-year hiatus, he returned on November 1, 2015 onwards.\nHowever, Gus's heralded \"return\" was in an updated computer digital image (CGI) with the conversion costing $68,700 in addition to an almost $400,000 advertising campaign. The decision to convert the popular character to pure CGI was initially somewhat controversial, prompting petitions and social media pages to be created to save Gus from transforming from a real-life creation to one some believed would have no real interplay with the other on-camera actors.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPunxsutawney Phil\n\n\n== References ==\nThe following is a list of unproduced Quentin Tarantino projects in roughly chronological order. During his career, American film director Quentin Tarantino has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. Some of these projects were officially cancelled and scrapped or fell into development hell.\n\n\n== 1980s ==\n\n\n=== Love Birds in Bondage ===\nTarantino co-wrote Love Birds in Bondage with Scott Magill or McGill. Tarantino would go on to co-produce and co-direct the film. McGill committed suicide in 1987, but not before destroying all footage that had been shot. The film concerned a young woman who suffered a traumatic brain injury after an accident leading her to act erratically. She is institutionalized in a mental hospital and her boyfriend figures out a way to get himself admitted. Tarantino also played the boyfriend.\n\n\n=== My Best Friend's Birthday ===\n\nLong before his first released feature Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino met with Craig Hamann and was introduced to his 30-40 page script, My Best Friend's Birthday. Tarantino helped expand the script up to 80 pages and agreed to direct the film. On a $5,000 budget and a 16 mm camera, the film was shot in the span of four years. It was often alleged that the completed run time came out to 70 minutes but due to a lab fire during editing, the film was nearly destroyed, and only 36 minutes remained. However, in the 2019 book My Best Friend's Birthday: The Making of a Quentin Tarantino Film, written by Andrew J. Rausch, it was revealed the fire story was fabricated, with Tarantino choosing not to dismiss it as he thought it sounded interesting. In actuality, some rolls of film were simply discarded by mistake, and Tarantino, unsatisfied with the final product, edited together the scenes he liked, leaving the project unfinished. The 36 minute version was roughly edited together, and screened at several film festivals.\n\n\n=== The Open Road ===\nTarantino co-worker and collaborator Roger Avary wrote a 40–80 page script while working with Tarantino at Video Archives. Avary likened it to Martin Scorsese's After Hours. The story revolved around a buttoned-up business man who decides to leave his world for the open road. He ends up picking up a wild hitchhiker and they get into various adventures. However, Avary struggled to finish the story and some point Tarantino started to work on it and make changes. According to Tarantino the title of the screenplay was Pandemonium Reigns. According to Avary, Pandemonium Reigns was a separate script about a boxer who does not throw a fight, and the origins of Butch Coolidge.: 144 \nAt some point the script was named The Open Road and Tarantino ended up turning it into a 500 page screenplay with Avary. A significant change came when Tarantino changed the business man and hitchhiker into a comic book store worker and a call girl named Clarence and Alabama. Clarence begins to write a movie script while the two of them are on the road about a psychotic fantasy version of him and Alabama. The couple are serial killers named Mickey and Mallory. Eventually story and plot from Clarence's script start to bleed into his and Alabama's life, blurring the lines of fantasy and reality.\nIn spite of being 500 pages, neither Tarantino or Avary could figure out how to end the story. They deconstructed the whole thing leading to the screenplays of True Romance and Natural Born Killers, as well as aspects of Killing Zoe and Pulp Fiction.\n\n\n== 1990s ==\n\n\n=== Untitled Luke Cage film ===\nAfter the release of Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino contemplated developing a film based on Luke Cage. Being a huge fan of the character, Tarantino held a meeting with producer Ed Pressman, who owned the film rights to Luke Cage, and proposed a film based on the character and suggested casting Laurence Fishburne as Cage. Despite liking the idea, Tarantino shifted his interest for Pulp Fiction.\n\n\n=== The Man from U.N.C.L.E. ===\n\nTarantino w\nThe following is a list of recurring sketches and characters which debuted on Conan, which aired from November 2010 to June 2021 on TBS. Conan is a talk/variety show starring Conan O'Brien and sidekick Andy Richter. Writers Deon Cole, Brian Stack, Andres du Bouchet, Dan Cronin, and members of The Basic Cable Band (especially Richie \"LaBamba\" Rosenberg), as well as propmaster Bill Tull, appeared in sketches as well. Some sketches featured celebrity cameos. After the reboot of the show in 2019, most of the skits were retired and the band was no longer present.\n\n\n== Characters ==\n\n\n=== Returning characters ===\nThe classic Late Night with Conan O'Brien characters The Interrupter, The Masturbating Bear and Triumph the Insult Comic Dog have made appearances on Conan.  In some cases, due to complaints, the Masturbating Bear is referred to by an alternate name, \"The Self-Pleasuring Panda.\"\n\n\n=== Punxsutawney Dr. Phil ===\nA hybrid of Dr. Phil McGraw and Punxsutawney Phil, this puppet talk show host groundhog first appeared after Groundhog Day in 2014. He appears as a groundhog with a bald head, Dr. Phil-style eyes, and a mustache. At the beginning of the sketches, Punxsutawney Dr. Phil rises up out of grass, and says \"Thanks so much!\" two or three times. After dispensing nonsensical relationship advice and theories about certain things, such as the mafia being responsible for celebrity relationships ending, Punxsutawney Dr. Phil then accuses Conan, who always criticizes him, of various false issues, such as prostitution, alcoholism, and cocaine addiction, using cut-together voice clips from the actual Dr. Phil show. Conan is stunned by the accusation, strongly denying it, but Andy confirms it, much to his chagrin. Punxsutawney Dr. Phil then promises to help Conan with his anger problems, prompting Conan to ask what will happen if he refuses to take his help. Punxsutawney Dr. Phil responds \"Then I will kill you,\" while brandishing a switchblade knife. Then after going back into the grass, Conan ends the sketch by saying to catch the Punxsutawney Dr. Phil Show weekdays at 4:00. One of Punxsutawney Dr. Phil's appearances on the show was during the real Dr. Phil's guest appearance. Dr. Phil criticized the groundhog's ridiculous advice, which prompted Punxsutawney Dr. Phil to start insulting him. After getting his advice shut down by Dr. Phil once again, Punxsutawney Dr. Phil tried his murder threat with the switchblade, only for Dr. Phil to pull out an even bigger knife. Having not expected that to happen, Punxsutawney Dr. Phil, shaking in fear, said goodbye in true Dr. Phil style (\"We'll see you next time!\") and then retreated back into his burrow, marking the first (and only) time he was defeated.\n\n\n=== The Flaming C ===\nConan and Bruce Timm created The Flaming C, a character based on Conan's appearance and jokingly referred to it as DC Comics' next superhero. The character has a comical appearance due to wearing things not associated with superheroes, such as a steaming ovenmit, a jai alai glove, ski goggles, a Star of David patch, socks with garters, fishnet stockings and loafers. Faux videos have been made where the character appears on the show Young Justice. His voice was provided by Bruce Greenwood in the Young Justice videos, partially because the character replaced Greenwood's character Batman in the first of these videos. Conan also played a faux trailer for an animated feature film about the character. The character also had a dedicated segment at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con. Conan later brought in a lifesize Lego statue of the character made by a viewer. On Conan's Clueless Gamer segment, he played as the Flaming C (as a Superman skin developed especially for the sketch) in Injustice: Gods Among Us. After the 2015 Comic-Con, it was turned into a weekly series on the show.\n\n\n=== The New York City Heckler ===\nA man (Eddie Pepitone) stands up and angrily yells at Conan in response to jokes in the monologue.

After World War II, white tie, morning dress and frock coats along with their counterpart, the top hat, started to become confined to high society, politics and international diplomacy. The last United States presidential inauguration with top hat was the inauguration of John F. Kennedy in 1961. Following the counterculture of the 1960s, its use declined further along with the disuse also of daily informal hats by men."

Definitions by philosophers such as Crosby (1998) and Deleuze (1962) focus on extreme critiques of nihilism like those asserted by Nietzsche.

Predictions cover 16 months, from the previous September (through December of the publication year).\nThe Farmers' Almanac will only state publicly that their method is an \"exclusive mathematical and astronomical formula, that relies on sunspot activity, tidal action, planetary position (astrology) and many other factors\". The Almanac's forecaster is referred to by the pseudonym Caleb Weatherbee. According to the publishers, the true identity of the forecaster is kept secret to prevent them from being \"badgered\"."

The system of the animatronics relies on a combination of electric motors, solenoids, hydraulic systems, pneumatic systems, and cables to produce repeatable puppet movements that syncs to sound.\nThe term \"Audio-Animatronics\" was first used commercially by Disney in 1961, was filed as a trademark in 1964, and was registered in 1967.\nDevelopment of the first audio animatronic technology began in 1949 with the work of the giant squid for 20,000 leagues under the sea (1954)."

Figures' movements have a neutral \"natural resting position\" that the limb or part returns to when there is no electric pulse present. Other than this, the animation is a binary system, with only on/off moves, such as an open or closed eye.

Eventually story and plot from Clarence's script start to bleed into his and Alabama's life, blurring the lines of fantasy and reality.\nIn spite of being 500 pages, neither Tarantino or Avary could figure out how to end the story.
