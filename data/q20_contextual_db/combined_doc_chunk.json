        "content": "Greererpeton burkemorani (\"crawler from Greer, West Virginia\") is an extinct genus of colosteid stem-tetrapods from the Early Carboniferous period (late Viséan) of North America. Greererpeton was first described by famed vertebrate paleontologist Alfred S. Romer in 1969, based on a skull and partial skeleton from the Bluefield Formation. The skull was redescribed by Timothy R. Smithson in 1982, while postcranial remains were redescribed by Stephen J. Godfrey in 1989.\n\nGreererpeton were probably aquatic, with an elongated body adapted for swimming. Adults have overall length of  1.0–1.4 metres (3.3–4.6 ft) or 1.5 metres (4.9 ft), similar in size to modern Asian giant salamanders (Andrias). The body was elongated, with about 40 vertebrae, while the flattened skull reached about 18 centimetres (7.1 in) long in adult specimens. The most complete adult specimen only preserved 12 tail vertebrae, only about a third the length of the body as in Andrias. However, smaller specimens have been found preserving over 30 vertebrae, so it is not inconceivable that a complete tail was approximately as long as the body. The limbs were short, though not vestigial; the fingers were still well-developed. Greererpeton were carnivores which probably lived in rivers and swamps.\n\n\n== Paleobiology ==\nThere is a large amount of evidence that Greererpeton and other colosteids were completely aquatic animals. Grooves on the side of the skull indicate that Greererpeton had lateral lines, sensory organs commonly found only in fish and aquatic stem-tetrapods. The stapes bone at the rear of the skull is massive, probably used as a support for the skull. This contrasts with the stapes of terrestrial animals such as frogs, mammals, and lizards. In these groups the bone is thin and sensitive to vibration, so it is used for sensitive hearing. The thick stapes of Greererpeton is an indication that did not have good hearing like terrestrial animals. Greererpeton retains a postbranchial lamina on its shoulder blade, which may have been indicative of internal gills like those of fish. However, the erratic distribution of postbranchial laminae in aquatic and terrestrial fish and amphibians makes this conclusion questionable.\nGodfrey (1989) considered Greererpeton to be biologically similar to the modern Asian giant salamanders (Andrias), the largest living amphibians. Preserved Greererpeton skeletons have their bodies lay completely flat, with their tails twisted over to lay flat perpendicular to the body. These preservational quirks may indicate that the body was flattened dorsoventrally (from top-to-bottom), while the tail was flattened mediolaterally (from side-to-side) into a fin-like structure used for swimming. Young Andrias congregate in shallow water while older individuals were bottom-dwelling predators preferring deeper rivers. Given that small Greererpeton skeletons have been found in groups while larger ones are solitary, it is presumable that Greererpeton behaved similarly.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGreerpeton & Spathicephalus from Palaeos web\nTHE MANDIBLE OF THE PRIMITIVE TETRAPOD GREERERPETON by JOHN R. BOLT and R. ERIC LOMBARD\nSkull fossil\nThis list of prehistoric amphibians is an attempt to create a comprehensive listing of all genera from the fossil record that have ever been considered to be amphibians, excluding purely vernacular terms. The list includes all commonly accepted genera, but also genera that are now considered invalid, doubtful (nomina dubia), or were not formally published (nomina nuda), as well as junior synonyms of more established names, and genera that are no longer considered amphibians. Modern forms are excluded from this list. The list currently includes 457 names.\n\n\n== Naming conventions and terminology ==\nNaming conventions and terminology follow the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Technical terms used include:\n\nJunior synonym: A name which describes the same taxon as a previously published name. If two or more genera are formally designated and the type specimens are later assigned to the same genus, the first to be published (in chronological order) is the senior synonym, and all other instances are junior synonyms. Senior synonyms are generally used, except by special decision of the ICZN, but junior synonyms cannot be used again, even if deprecated. Junior synonymy is often subjective, unless the genera described were both based on the same type specimen.\nNomen nudum (Latin for \"naked name\"): A name that has appeared in print but has not yet been formally published by the standards of the ICZN. Nomina nuda (the plural form) are invalid, and are therefore not italicized as a proper generic name would be. If the name is later formally published, that name is no longer a nomen nudum and will be italicized on this list. Often, the formally published name will differ from any nomina nuda that describe the same specimen.\nNomen oblitum (Latin for \"forgotten name\"): A name that has not been used in the scientific community for more than fifty years after its original proposal.\nPreoccupied name: A name that is formally published, but which has already been used for another taxon. This second use is invalid (as are all subsequent uses) and the name must be replaced. As preoccupied names are not valid generic names, they will also go unitalicized on this list.\nNomen dubium (Latin for \"dubious name\"): A name describing a fossil with no unique diagnostic features. As this can be an extremely subjective and controversial designation, this term is not used on this list.\n\n\n== A ==\n\n\n== B ==\n\n\n== C ==\n\n\n== D ==\n\n\n== E ==\n\nEcolsonia\nElfridia\nElginerpeton\nEmbolomeri\nEnneabatrachus\nEocaecilia\nEocyclotosaurus\nEodiscoglossus\nEogyrinus\nEopelobates\nEorhinophrynus\nEoscapherpeton\nEoscopus\nEoxenopoides\nErpetocephalus\nErpetosaurus\nEryops\nEryosuchus\nErythrobatrachus\nEstesina\nEugyrinus\nEupelor\nEuryodus\nEryosuchus\n\n\n== F ==\nFayella\nFedexia\nFerganobatrachus\n\n\n== G ==\n\nGaudrya\nGeorgenthalia\nGephyrostegus\nGerrothorax\nGerobatrachus\nGobiates\nGobiatoides\nGobiops\nGonioglyptus\nGosgriffius\nGreererpeton\n\n\n== H ==\nHabrosaurus\nHadrokkosaurus\nHapsidopareion\nHatzegobatrachus\nHemprichisaurus\nHeptasaurus\nHorezmia\nHylaeobatrachus\nHyperkynodon\nHynerpeton\n\n\n== I ==\nIcanosaurus\nIchthyostega\nIndobenthosuchus\nIndobrachyops\nIndolyrocephalus\nInflectosaurus\nInflectosuchus\nIntasuchus\nIratusaurus\nIridotriton\nIsodectes\nItemirella\n\n\n== J ==\nJammerbergia\nJakubsonia\nJeholotriton\n\n\n== K ==\n\nKamacops\nKaraurus\nKeraterpeton\nKeratobrachyops\nKestrosaurus\nKizylkuma\nKoalliella\nKokartus\nKomatosuchus\nKonzukovia\nKoolasuchus\nKoskinonodon\nKourerpeton\nKryostega\nKuttycephalus\n\n\n== L ==\n\nLabyrinthodontia\nLaccocephalus\nLaccosaurus\nLaccotriton\nLafonius\nLaidleria\nLapillopsis\nLatiscopus\nLatonia\nLeiocephalikon\nLepterpeton\nLethiscus\nLiaobatrachus\nLiaoxitriton\nLimnerpeton\nLimnoiketes\nLimnogyrinus\nLisserpeton\nLithobatrachus\nLlankibatrachus\nLlistrofus\nLongiscitula\nLoxomma\nLuzocephalus\nLydekkerina\nLyrocephaliscus\nLysorophus\n\n\n== M ==\n\n\n== N ==\nNannaroter\nNannospongylus\nNanolania\nNeldasaurus\nNeusibatrachus\nNevobatrachus\nNezpercius\nNigerpeton\nNotobatrachus\nNotobrachiops\n\n\n== O ==\n\nOdenwaldia\nOdonterpeton\n\nThe Lissamphibia (from Greek λισσός (lissós, \"smooth\") + ἀμφίβια (amphíbia), meaning \"smooth amphibians\") is a group of tetrapods that includes all modern amphibians. Lissamphibians consist of three living groups: the Salientia (frogs, toads, and their extinct relatives), the Caudata (salamanders, newts, and their extinct relatives), and the Gymnophiona (the limbless caecilians and their extinct relatives).\nSalientians and caudatans are likely more closely related to each other than to caecilians. The name Batrachia is commonly used for the clade combining salientians and caudatans. A fourth group, the Allocaudata (also known as Albanerpetontidae) is also known, spanning 160 million years from the Middle Jurassic to the Early Pleistocene, but became extinct two million years ago.\nFor several decades, this name has been used for a group that includes all living amphibians, but excludes all the main groups of Paleozoic tetrapods, such as Temnospondyli, Lepospondyli, Embolomeri, and Seymouriamorpha. Most scientists have concluded that all of the primary groups of modern amphibians—frogs, salamanders and caecilians—are closely related.\nSome writers have argued that the early Permian dissorophoid Gerobatrachus hottoni is a lissamphibian. If it is not, the earliest known lissamphibians are Triadobatrachus and Czatkobatrachus from the Early Triassic.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nSome, if not all, lissamphibians share the following characteristics. Some of these apply to the soft body parts, hence do not appear in fossils. However, the skeletal characteristics also appear in several types of Palaeozoic amphibians:\n\nDouble or paired occipital condyles\nTwo types of skin glands (mucous and granular)\nFat bodies associated with gonads\nDouble-channeled sensory papillae in the inner ear\nGreen rods (a special type of visual cell, unknown in caecilians)\nRibs do not encircle body. In anurans the ribs are fused to their vertebrae, except in the suborder Archaeobatrachia which still has free ribs.\nAbility to elevate the eyes (with the levator bulbi muscle)\nForced-pump respiratory mechanism, the primitive breathing system also found in labyrinthodont amphibians\nCylindrical centra (the main body of the vertebrae; cylindrical centra are also found in several groups of early tetrapods)\nPedicellate teeth (the crowns of the teeth are separated from the roots by a zone of fibrous tissue; also found in some Dissorophoidea; the teeth of some fossil salamanders are not pedicellate)\nBicuspid teeth (two cusps per tooth, also found in juvenile dissorophoids)\nOperculum (small bone in the skull, linked to shoulder girdle by the opercularis muscle; perhaps involved in hearing and balance; absent in caecilians and some salamanders, fused to the columella (ear bone) in most anurans)\nLoss of posterior skull bones (also in Microsauria and Dissorophoidea)\nSmall, widely separated pterygoid bones (also found in Temnospondyli and Nectridea)\nWide cultriform process of the parasphenoid (also found in some Microsauria (Rhynchonkos) and Lysorophia)\nPresence of ampullae of Lorenzini in some salamanders and caecilians, but never in frogs\n\n\n== Relationships and definition ==\n\nThe features uniting the Lissamphibia were first noted by Ernst Haeckel, even though in Haeckel's work, Lissamphibia excluded the caecilians. Nevertheless, Haeckel considered the caecilians to be closely related to what he called Lissamphibia (gr. λισσός, smooth), which is now called Batrachia and includes frogs and salamanders. In the early to mid 20th century, a biphyletic origin of amphibians (and thus of tetrapods in general) was favoured. In the late 20th century, a flood of new fossil evidence mapped out in some detail the nature of the transition between the elpistostegalid fish and the early amphibians. Most herpetologists and paleontologists, therefore, no longer accept the view that amphibians have arisen twice, from two related but separate groups of fish. The question then arises whether Lissamphi\nIchthyostega (from Greek: ἰχθῦς ikhthûs, 'fish' and Greek: στέγη stégē, 'roof') is an extinct genus of limbed tetrapodomorphs from the Late Devonian of what is now Greenland. It was among the earliest four-limbed vertebrates ever in the fossil record and was one of the first with weight-bearing adaptations for terrestrial locomotion. Ichthyostega possessed lungs and limbs that helped it navigate through shallow water in swamps. Although Ichthyostega is often labelled a 'tetrapod' because of its limbs and fingers, it evolved long before true crown group tetrapods and could more accurately be referred to as a stegocephalian or stem tetrapod. Likewise, while undoubtedly of amphibian build and habit, it is not a true member of the group in the narrow sense, as the first modern amphibians (members of the group Lissamphibia) appeared in the Triassic Period. Until finds of other early stegocephalians and closely related fishes in the late 20th century, Ichthyostega stood alone as a transitional fossil between fish and tetrapods, combining fish and tetrapod features. Newer research has shown that it had an unusual anatomy, functioning more akin to a seal than a salamander, as previously assumed.\n\n\n== History ==\n \nIn 1932 Gunnar Säve-Söderbergh described four Ichthyostega species from the Late Devonian of East Greenland and one species belonging to the genus Ichthyostegopsis, I. wimani. These species could be synonymous (in which case only I. stensioei would remain), because their morphological differences are not very pronounced. The species differ in skull proportions, skull punctuation and skull bone patterns. The comparisons were done on 14 specimens collected in 1931 by the Danish East Greenland Expedition. Additional specimens were collected between 1933 and 1955.\n\n\n== Description ==\nIchthyostega was a fairly large animal for its time, as it was broadly built and about 1.5 m (4.9 ft) long. The skull was low, with dorsally placed eyes and large labyrinthodont teeth. The posterior margin of the skull formed an operculum covering the gills. The spiracle was situated in an otic notch behind each eye. Computed tomography has revealed that Ichthyostega had a specialized ear, including a stapes with a unique morphology compared to other tetrapods or to any fish hyomandibula. \n\n\n=== Postcranial skeleton ===\nThe legs were large compared to contemporary relatives. It had seven digits on each hind leg, along with a peculiar, poorly ossified mass which lies anteriorly adjacent to the digits. The exact number of digits on the forelimb is not yet known, since fossils of the hand have not been found. While in water, the foot would have functioned like a fleshy paddle more than a fin.The vertebral column and ribcage of Ichthyostega was unusual and highly specialized relative to both its contemporaries and later tetrapods. The thoracic vertebrae at the front of the trunk and the short neck have tall neural spines that lean backwards. They attach to pointed ribs which increase in size and acquire prominent overlapping flanges. Past the sixth or seventh flanged rib, the ribs abruptly decrease in size and lose their flanges. The lumbar vertebrae at the back of the trunk have strong muscle scars and neural spines which are bent forwards and decrease in size towards the hips. The sacral vertebrae above the hips have fan-shaped neural spines that transition from forward-leaning to backward-leaning as they approach the tail. The vertebrae right behind the hips have unusually large ribs similar to those of the thoracic region. The caudal vertebrae have slender spines that lean backwards. The tail of Ichthyostega retained a low fin supported by bony lepidotrichia (fin rays). The tail fin was not as deep as in Acanthostega, and would have been less useful for swimming.\n\nIchthyostega is related to Acanthostega gunnari, which is also from what is now East Greenland. Ichthyostega's skull seems more fish-like than that of Acanthostega, but its pelvic girdle mo\nTemnospondyli (from Greek τέμνειν, temnein 'to cut' and σπόνδυλος, spondylos 'vertebra') or temnospondyls is a diverse ancient order of small to giant tetrapods—often considered primitive amphibians—that flourished worldwide during the Carboniferous, Permian and Triassic periods, with fossils being found on every continent. A few species continued into the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous periods, but all had gone extinct by the Late Cretaceous. During about 210 million years of evolutionary history, they adapted to a wide range of habitats, including freshwater, terrestrial, and even coastal marine environments. Their life history is well understood, with fossils known from the larval stage, metamorphosis and maturity. Most temnospondyls were semiaquatic, although some were almost fully terrestrial, returning to the water only to breed. These temnospondyls were some of the first vertebrates fully adapted to life on land. Although temnospondyls are amphibians, many had characteristics such as scales and large armour-like bony plates (osteoderms) that generally distinguish them from the modern soft-bodied lissamphibians (frogs and toads, newts, salamanders and caecilians).\nTemnospondyls have been known since the early 19th century, and were initially thought to be reptiles. They were described at various times as batrachians, stegocephalians and labyrinthodonts, although these names are now rarely used. Animals now grouped in Temnospondyli were spread out among several amphibian groups until the early 20th century, when they were found to belong to a distinct taxon based on the structure of their vertebrae. Temnospondyli means \"cut vertebrae\", as each vertebra is divided into several parts (intercentrum, paired pleurocentra, neural arch), although this occurs widely among other early tetrapods.\nExperts disagree over whether temnospondyls were ancestral to modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians), or whether the whole group died out without leaving any descendants. Different hypotheses have placed modern amphibians as the descendants of temnospondyls, as descendants of another group of early tetrapods called lepospondyls, or even as descendants of both groups (with caecilians evolving from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders evolving from temnospondyls). There is further disagreement about a temnospondyl origin of lissamphibians related to whether the modern groups arose from only one group (dissorophoids) or from two different groups (dissorophoids and stereospondyls). The majority of studies place a group of temnospondyls called amphibamiforms as the closest relatives of modern amphibians. Similarities in teeth, skulls and hearing structures link the two groups. Whether temnospondyls are considered part of the tetrapod crown or stem thus depends on their inferred relationship to lissamphibians.\n\n\n== Definitions ==\n\n\n=== Branch-based definition ===\nIn 2000, Adam Yates and Anne Warren defined the name Temnospondyli as applying to the clade encompassing all organisms that are more closely related to Eryops than to the “microsaur” Pantylus. By this definition, if lissamphibians are temnospondyls and Pantylus is a reptiliomorph, the name Temnospondyli is synonymous with Batrachomorpha (a clade containing all organisms that are more closely related to modern amphibians than to mammals and reptiles).\n\n\n=== Node-based definition ===\nRainer Schoch in 2013 defined the name Temnospondyli as applying to “[t]he least inclusive clade containing Edops craigi and Mastodonsaurus giganteus”.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nMany temnospondyls are much larger than living amphibians, and superficially resemble crocodiles, which has led many taxa to be named with the suffix -suchus. The largest taxa, which were predominantly the Mesozoic stereospondyls, had skulls exceeding one meter in length, and the entire animal would have been several meters in length (for reference, the largest living amphibian, Andrias, is about 1.8 meters in body length).\nVentastega (Venta referring to the Venta River at the Ketleri Formation where Ventastega was discovered) is an extinct genus of stem tetrapod that lived during the Upper Fammenian of the Late Devonian, approximately 372.2 to 358.9 million years ago. Only one species is known that belongs in the genus, Ventastega curonica, which was described in 1996 after fossils were discovered in 1933 and mistakenly associated with a fish called Polyplocodus wenjukovi. ‘Curonica’ in the species name refers to Curonia, the Latin name for Kurzeme, a region in western Latvia. Ventastega curonica was discovered in two localities in Latvia, and was the first stem tetrapod described in Latvia along with being only the 4th Devonian tetrapodomorph known at the time of description. Based on the morphology of both cranial and post-cranial elements discovered (see below), Ventastega is more primitive than other Devonian tetrapodomorphs including Acanthostega and Ichthyostega, and helps further understanding of the fish-tetrapod transition.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nWalter Gross was the first person to collect partial Ventastega remains, collecting some teeth in addition to scales from a locality called Ketleri in a Latvian Upper Famennian formation while on a collection trip in 1933. Gross attributed all remains to an osteolepiform fish named Polyplocodus wenjukov, before later in 1944 reattributing some of the fragments to a species called Panderichthys bystrowi when a piece of a lower jaw was collected from the same locality. Additional remains were collected from the locality and from another locality, Pavāri, in the same formation by researchers Per Erik Ahlberg, Ervīns Lukševičs, and Oleg Lebedev. After this collection they realized the previously collected remains were assigned incorrectly, and were actually part of a newly discovered tetrapod, which they named and described in a paper published in 1996. In the follow years, several more fragments of Ventastega curonica remains have been discovered at both the Ketleri and Pavāri localities, with all specimens residing at the Natural History Museum of Latvia.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Cranial elements ===\n\n\n==== Lower jaw ====\nThe Ventastega holotype (LDM 81/521) is a right lower jaw ramus from Pavāri, and was described by Per Erik Ahlberg, Ervīns Lukševičs, and Oleg Lebedev. The lower jaw ramus total length was estimated to be over 200mm. This, combined with other cranial and post-cranial elements of Ventastega, made researchers predict that it was larger than Ichthyostega. The mandible is widest anterior to the first coronoid fang. The dentary is long and shallow, and has a butt joint as the contact with the coronoid series, indicating the dentary is loosely attached to the jaw. Similar to some tetrapods such as Acanthostega and Tulerpeton, the dentary's lateral surface is ornamented on the dorsal side with a smooth section only on the ventral margin. Another lower jaw specimen (LDM 81/552) is the only known complete Ventastega dentary, and shows Ventastega had 89 marginal teeth on each side of the jaw that are all approximately the same size, although they decrease in height as you move distally. Ventastega also has a pair of fangs on each dentary that are situated close to where the two dentaries meet at the most anterior part of the lower jaw, similar to Panderichthyes and Ichthyostega. On the precoronoid and intercornoid, Ventastega has fangs pairs set within the marginal row of teeth. On the lower jaw, Ventastega had a surangular pit line, which is present in most Sarcopterygians but unknown in any other tetrapods. A primitive characteristic on Ventastega, shared only with fish and Ichthyostega, is the presence of a fully enclosed mandibular sensory canal which opens to the external world through only a single row of pores.\n\n\n==== Dermal skull bones ====\nMaxillae, premaxillae, palatines, and a vomer along with large skull fragments from Pavāri have been identified as Ventastega. The maxilla is long\nStegocephali (often spelled Stegocephalia, from Greek στεγοκεφαλια, lit. \"roofed head\")  is a clade of vertebrate animals containing all fully limbed tetrapodomorphs. It is equivalent to a broad definition of the superclass Tetrapoda: under this broad definition, the term \"tetrapod\" applies to any animal descended from the first vertebrate with four limbs each with digits in the extremity (pentadactyly), rather than fins of their sarcopterygian relatives.\nStegocephalians include both the modern lineage of limbed vertebrates (the crown group tetrapods, including modern amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals) as well as a portion of the stem group, the earliest limbed tetrapodomorphs such as Ichthyostega and Acanthostega, which evolved in the Devonian period long before the origin of the crown group. Many paleontologists prefer a stricter definition of Tetrapoda which applies solely to the crown group, excluding earlier types of limbed tetrapodomorphs. Stegocephali was re-established to replace the broad definition of Tetrapoda, resolving the usage of two conflicting definitions in discussions of tetrapod evolution.\nStegocephali was coined in 1868 by the American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope, who used it as a general category of prehistoric amphibians. This name was in reference to the skull form of many early tetrapods, with a low, solid shape combining numerous strongly-textured dermal bones. In its original usage, the term quickly became obsolete. In 1998, Canadian paleontologist Michel Laurin repopularized the term and provided a formal phylogenetic definition as a monophyletic clade containing both crown-group and stem-group tetrapods. Laurin's Stegocephali is roughly defined as including all vertebrates closer to modern tetrapods than to Panderichthys. This definition was intended to include taxa with digits rather than fins, except where secondarily lost. Another definition, published in Phylonyms, defines the group as including all taxa closer to Eryops than to Tiktaalik, Panderichthys, or Eusthenopteron. The discovery of the Zachelmie trackways in 2010 suggests that stegocephalians possibly emerged 395 Ma or earlier.\n\n\n== History of classification ==\n\nOriginally, the term was used as a systematic unit at the rank of order. The term rose to prominence in American and British science in the 19th century, though the largely equivalent term Labyrinthodontia had been coined 18 years earlier by Hermann Burmeister in reference to the tooth structure. The terms were used interchangeably during the early 20th century, usually divided into three orders. Cope originally spelled the term as \"Stegocephali\", though A.S. Woodward introduced a popular alternative spelling, \"Stegocephalia\", in 1898. In their original usage, Stegocephali (and the Labyrinthodontia) are paraphyletic, the name is now used in an informal way to denote the early non-piscine vertebrates, excluding amniotes (the first reptiles and their descendants) and modern lissamphibians.\nPaleontologist Michel Laurin took up the older term and defined stegocephalians phylogenetically as all vertebrates more closely related to Temnospondyli than to Panderichthys (the closest relative of tetrapods known to have retained paired fins, see below). Therefore, Stegocephali includes all vertebrate groups that have toes rather than fins, and a few (Elginerpeton, Metaxygnathus, Ventastega and possibly Hynerpeton) that may have retained paired fins. Contrary to the old usage of this term, the Stegocephali refers to a clade in this scheme. This concept of the clade Stegocephali was chosen to substitute for the name Tetrapoda by those who sought to restrict Tetrapoda to the crown group. As such, it encompasses all presently living land vertebrates as well as their early amphibious ancestors.\n\n\n== Phylogeny ==\nBelow is an evolutionary tree of stegocephalians, as recovered from an analysis by Swartz in 2012.\n\nAs recovered by Clack et al. 2016:\n\n\n== Subgroups ==\n†Elginerpetontidae\n†\nBaphetidae is an extinct family of stem-tetrapods. Baphetids were large labyrinthodont predators of the Late Carboniferous period (Namurian through Westphalian) of Europe. Fragmentary remains from the Early Carboniferous of Canada have been tentatively assigned to the group. The phylogenetic relationships of baphetids is uncertain; while many studies have placed the group as a close relative of Amniota, other analyses have found Baphetidae to be a more basal clade of early stem tetrapods. Baphetids were among the first of the Carboniferous fossil tetrapods to be found and were originally described in 1850 by John William Dawson. The baphetids have been referred to the family Loxommatidae, but this group was later shown to be a junior synonym of Baphetidae, which was named earlier in 1865. Baphetids are known mainly from skulls; very little postcranial material has been found.\n\n\n== Palaeobiology ==\nThe presence of lateral lines and the long rows of needle-like teeth show that most were fish-eaters.  Their development was likely amphibian, though no larval fossils are known. Their best-known characteristic was a curious, keyhole-shaped orbit formed by excavation of the lacrimal and prefrontal bones in front of the eye.  It has been suggested that this space accommodated a salt gland or some kind of electrosensory organ.  Perhaps the better hypothesis is that the space allowed room for the contraction of an enlarged pterygoideus muscle.  In that case, this skull modification would represent an early form of skull fenestration for jaw muscles.\nThe skull is shallow.  Unlike the better-known embolomeres, the baphetid cheek and skull roof are sutured together.  There is a strongly embayed spiracular (\"otic\") notch, but the stapes is distally broad, which seems to rule out a sensitive hearing apparatus.  The palate is closed—a primitive character, but very different from the temnospondyls.  The coronoids bear no teeth or denticles, while the dentary has a double tooth row.\nSince the taxon is based almost exclusively on skulls, the body is very poorly known.  It is often said that the body was crocodile-like, but this appears to be largely supposition.  \n\nIt is not clear whether all of the genera assigned to this group are really closely related.  The traditional four genera of baphetids (Loxomma, Baphetes, Megalocephalus, and Spathicephalus) have recently been supplemented by Eucritta, a somewhat different form.  It has also been suggested that Crassigyrinus may be closely related.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nBaphetids were first described by Edward Drinker Cope when he erected the family Baphetidae in 1865 for Baphetes. Richard Lydekker named Loxomatinae in 1889 for Loxomma, which later became known as Loxommatidae. D. M. S. Watson described the group as Loxommidae in 1917. Later studies have shown Baphetes and Loxomma to be close relatives within the same family, and because Baphetidae was named before Loxommatidae, it has seniority and is the valid name of the group.\n\n\n=== Phylogeny ===\nBaphetids have been previously considered primitive temnospondyls and more recently batrachosaurs (reptile-like amphibia).   It is likely, however, that they represent one more of a number of early Carboniferous tetrapodomorph radiations.  Computer-assisted phylogenetic analyses of a data matrix using characteristics of most of the major groups of terrestrial vertebrates place the Baphetids close to the ancestry of amniotes.\nWith the reinterpretation of the Ichthyostegalia as aquatic forms, baphetids are good candidates for the spot of first labyrinthodont group to actually spend substantial time on land. If so, baphetids may be a rather important taxon.\n\n\n== References ==\nAcanthostega (meaning \"spiny roof\") is an extinct genus of stem-tetrapod, among the first vertebrate animals to have recognizable limbs. It appeared in the late Devonian period (Famennian age) about 365 million years ago, and was anatomically intermediate between lobe-finned fishes and those that were fully capable of coming onto land.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\n \nThe fossilized remains are generally well preserved, with the famous fossil by which the significance of this species  was discovered being found by Jennifer A. Clack in East Greenland in 1987, though fragments of the skull had been discovered in 1933 by Gunnar Säve-Söderbergh and Erik Jarvik.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe 60 cm (24 in) Acanthostega had eight digits on each hand (the number of digits on the feet is unclear) linked by webbing, it lacked wrists, and was generally poorly adapted for walking on land. It also had a remarkably fish-like shoulder and forelimb. The front limbs of Acanthostega could not bend forward at the elbow, and  therefore could not be brought into a weight bearing position, appearing to be more suitable for paddling or for holding on to aquatic plants. Acanthostega is the earliest stem-tetrapod to show the shift in locomotory dominance from the pectoral girdle to the pelvic girdle.\nThere are many morphological changes that allowed the pelvic girdle of Acanthostega to become a weight-bearing structure. In more ancestral states the two sides of the girdle were not attached. In Acanthostega there is contact between the two sides and fusion of the girdle with the sacral rib of the vertebral column. These fusions would have made the pelvic region more powerful and equipped to counter the force of gravity when not supported by the buoyancy of an aquatic environment. It had internal gills that were covered like those of fish. It also had lungs, but its ribs were too short to support its chest cavity out of water.\n\n\n== Classification ==\n\nAcanthostega is seen as part of widespread evolutionary radiation in the late Devonian period, starting with purely aquatic finned tetrapodomorphs, with their successors showing increased air-breathing capability and related adaptions to the jaws and gills, as well as more muscular neck allowing freer movement of the head than fish have, and use of the fins to raise the body of the fish. These features are displayed by the earlier Tiktaalik, which like Ichthyostega showed signs of greater abilities to move around on land, but is thought to have been primarily aquatic.\nIn Late Devonian vertebrate speciation, descendants of pelagic lobe-finned fish –like Eusthenopteron– exhibited a sequence of adaptations: Panderichthys, suited to muddy shallows; Tiktaalik with limb-like fins that could take it onto land; stem-tetrapods in weed-filled swamps, such as Acanthostega, which had eight-digited feet; and Ichthyostega, with full limbs. Their descendants also included pelagic lobe-finned fish such as coelacanth species.\n\n\n== Paleobiology ==\n\n\n=== Hunting strategy ===\n\nIt has been inferred that Acanthostega probably lived in shallow, weed-choked swamps, its legs apparently being adapted for these specific ecosystems. Apart from the presence of limbs, it was not adapted in any way for walking on land. Jennifer A. Clack interprets this as showing that Acanthostega was primarily an aquatic animal descended from fish that never left the sea, and that the specializations of the tetrapod lineage were exaptations: features which would later be useful for terrestrial life, even if they originated for a different purpose. At that period, deciduous plants were flourishing and annually shedding leaves into the water, attracting small prey into warm oxygen-poor shallows that were difficult for larger fish to swim in; Clack remarks on how the lower jaw of Acanthostega shows a change from those of fish that have two rows of teeth, with a large number of small teeth in the outer row, and two large fangs and some smaller teeth in the inner row. This di\n\"Labyrinthodontia\" (Greek, 'maze-toothed') is an informal grouping of extinct predatory amphibians which were major components of ecosystems in the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras (about 390 to 150 million years ago). Traditionally considered a subclass of the class Amphibia, modern classification systems recognize that labyrinthodonts are not a formal natural group (clade) exclusive of other tetrapods. Instead, they consistute an evolutionary grade (a paraphyletic group), ancestral to living tetrapods such as lissamphibians (modern amphibians) and amniotes (reptiles, mammals, and kin). \"Labyrinthodont\"-grade vertebrates evolved from lobe-finned fishes in the Devonian, though a formal boundary between fish and amphibian is difficult to define at this point in time.\n\"Labyrinthodont\" generally refers to extinct four-limbed tetrapods with a large body size and a crocodile-like lifestyle. The name describes the pattern of infolding of the dentin and enamel of the teeth, which are often the only part of the creatures that fossilize. They are also distinguished by a broad, strongly-built skull roof composed of many small heavily-textured skull bones. \"Labyrinthodonts\" generally have complex multi-part vertebrae, and several classification schemes have utilized vertebrae to define subgroups.\nBecause labyrinthodonts do not form a monophyletic group, many modern researchers have abandoned the term. However, some have continued to use the group in their classifications, at least informally, pending more detailed study of their relationships. Many authors prefer to simply use the term tetrapod, while others have re-defined the previously obsolete term Stegocephalia (\"roof heads\") as a cladistic alternative to \"Labyrinthodontia\" or \"Tetrapoda\".\n\n\n== Labyrinthodont traits ==\n\nThe labyrinthodonts flourished for more than 200 million years. Particularly the early forms exhibited a lot of variation, yet there are still a few basic anatomical traits that make their fossils very distinct and easily recognizable in the field:\n\nStrongly folded tooth surface, involving infolding of the dentin and enamel of the teeth. The cross section resembles a classical labyrinth (or maze), hence the name of the group.\nMassive skull roof, with openings only for the nostrils, eyes and a parietal eye, similar to the structure of the \"anapsid\" reptiles. With the exception of the later more reptile-like forms, the skull was rather flat and strongly ornamented with presumably tough dermal covering, accounting for an older term for the group: \"Stegocephalia\".\nOtic notch behind each eye at the back edge of the skull. In earlier fully aquatic forms such as Ichthyostega, it may have formed an open spiracle. In later terrestrial forms such as Seymouria, it may possibly have held a tympanic membrane (eardrum).\nComplex vertebrae made of multiple components: an intercentrum (wedge-shaped front lower piece), two pleurocentra (upper rear piece), and a vertebral arch/spine (upper projection). The relative development and shape of the elements is highly variable.\n\n\n== The labyrinthodonts in life ==\n\n\n=== General build ===\nLabyrinthodonts were generally amphibian-like in build. They were short-legged and mostly large headed, with moderately short to long tails. Many groups, and all the early forms, were large animals. Primitive members of all labyrinthodont groups were probably true water predators, and various degrees of amphibious, semi-aquatic and semi terrestrial modes of living arose independently in different groups. Some lineages remained waterbound or became secondarily fully aquatic with reduced limbs and elongated, eel-like bodies.\n\n\n=== Skull ===\n\nWith the exception of the snake-like aïstopods, the skulls of labyrinthodonts were massive.  The broad head and short neck may have been a result of respiratory constraints. Their jaws were lined with small, sharp, conical teeth and the roof of the mouth bore larger tusk-like teeth. The teeth were replaced in waves th\nRomer's gap is an apparent gap in the Paleozoic tetrapod fossil record used in the study of evolutionary biology, which represent periods from which excavators have not yet found relevant fossils. It is named after American paleontologist Alfred Romer, who first recognised it in 1956. Recent discoveries in Scotland are beginning to close this gap in palaeontological knowledge.\n\n\n== Age ==\nRomer's gap runs from approximately 360 to 345 million years ago, corresponding to the first 15 million years of the Carboniferous, the early Mississippian (starting with the Tournaisian and moving into the Visean). The gap forms a discontinuity between the primitive forests and high diversity of fishes in the end Devonian and more modern aquatic and terrestrial assemblages of the early Carboniferous.\n\n\n== Mechanism behind the gap ==\nThere has been long debate as to why there are so few fossils from this time period. Some have suggested the problem was of fossilization itself, suggesting that there may have been differences in the geochemistry of the time that did not favour fossil formation. Also, excavators simply may not have dug in the right places. The existence of a true low point in vertebrate diversity has been supported by independent lines of evidence, however recent finds in five new locations in Scotland have yielded multiple fossils of early tetrapods and amphibians. They have also allowed the most accurate logging of the geology of this period. This new evidence suggests that - at least locally - there was no gap in diversity or changes in oxygen geochemistry.\nWhile initial arthropod terrestriality was well under way before the gap, and some digited tetrapods might have come on land, there are remarkably few terrestrial or aquatic fossils that date from the gap itself. Recent work on Paleozoic geochemistry has provided evidence for the biological reality of Romer's gap in both terrestrial vertebrates and arthropods, and has correlated it with a period of unusually low atmospheric oxygen concentration, which was determined from the idiosyncratic geochemistry of rocks formed during Romer's gap. The new sedimentary logging in the Ballagan Formation in Scotland challenges this, suggesting oxygen was stable throughout Romer's Gap.\nAquatic vertebrates, which include most tetrapods during the Carboniferous, were recovering from the Hangenberg event, a major extinction event that preceded Romer's gap, one on par with that which killed the dinosaurs. In this end-Devonian extinction, most marine and freshwater groups became extinct or were reduced to a few lineages, although the precise mechanism of the extinction is unclear. Before the event, oceans and lakes were dominated by lobe-finned fishes and armored fishes called placoderms. After the gap, modern ray finned fish, as well as sharks and their relatives were the dominant forms. The period also saw the demise of the Ichthyostegalia, the early fish-like amphibians with more than five digits.\nThe low diversity of marine fishes, particularly shell-crushing predators (durophages), at the beginning of Romer's gap is supported by the sudden abundance of hard-shelled crinoid echinoderms during the same period. The Tournaisian has even been called the \"Age of Crinoids\". Once the number of shell-crushing ray-finned fishes and sharks increased later in the Carboniferous, coincident with the end of Romer's gap, the diversity of crinoids with Devonian-type armor plummeted, following the pattern of a classic predator-prey (Lotka-Volterra) cycle. There is increasing evidence that lungfish and stem tetrapods and amphibians recovered quickly and diversified in the rapidly changing environment of the end-Devonian and Romer's Gap.\n\n\n== Gap fauna ==\n\nThe gap in the tetrapod record has been progressively closed with the discoveries of such early Carboniferous tetrapods as Pederpes and Crassigyrinus. There are a few sites where vertebrate fossils have been found to help fill in the gap, such as the East \nThis is a list of common affixes used when scientifically naming species, particularly extinct species for whom only their scientific names are used, along with their derivations.\n\na-, an-: Pronunciation: /ə/, /a/, /ən/, /an/.

Panderichthys, which was recovered from Frasnian (early Late Devonian) deposits in Latvia, is represented by two species. P. stolbovi is known only from some snout fragments and an incomplete lower jaw. P. rhombolepis is known from several more complete specimens. Although it probably belongs to a sister group of the earliest tetrapods, Panderichthys exhibits a range of features transitional between tristichopterid lobe-fin fishes (e.g., Eusthenopteron) and early tetrapods. It is named after the German-Baltic paleontologist Christian Heinrich Pander. Possible tetrapod tracks dating back to before the appearance of Panderichthys in the fossil record were reported in 2010, which suggests that Panderichthys is not a direct ancestor of tetrapods, but nonetheless shows the traits that evolved during the fish-tetrapod evolution \n\n\n== Discovery and history ==\nPanderichthys is represented by two different species: Panderichthys rhombolepis and Panderichthys stobolvi. P. rhombolepis was discovered by Gross in 1930 and P. stobolvi was discovered and figured by Emilia Vorobyeva in 1960. P. rhombolepis was discovered in Lode, Latvia within Frasnian deposits and according to P.E. Ahlberg can definitely be found in other Frasnian deposits in Latvia. Although fossils of Panderichthys have been known for a long time, they have only recently been examined in full. The first time they were recognized as being phylogenetically closer to tetrapods than fish was by Shultze and Arsenault in 1985.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nPanderichthys is a 1.5–2 m (4 ft 11 in – 6 ft 7 in) long fish with a large tetrapod-like head that is flattened, narrow at the snout and wide in the back. The intracranial joint, which is characteristic of most lobe-fin fishes, has been lost from the external elements of the skull, but is still present in the braincase. The patterns of external bones in the skull roof and cheeks are more similar to those of early tetrapods than those of other lobe-fins. The transitional qualities of Panderichthys are also evident in the rest of the body. It lacks the dorsal and anal fins (fish fin) and its tail is more like those of early tetrapods than the caudal fins of other lobe-fins. The shoulders exhibit several tetrapod-like features, while the humerus is longer than those found in other lobe-fins. The vertebral column is ossified throughout its length and the vertebrae are comparable to those of early tetrapods. On the other hand, the distal parts of the front fins are unlike those of tetrapods. As would be expected from a fin, there are numerous lepidotrichia (long and thin fin rays).\nPanderichthys has many features that can be considered an intermediate form during the fish-tetrapod evolution and displays some features that are more derived than its phylogenetic position indicates, while others that are more basal. The body form of Panderichthys and Tiktaalik represents a major step in the transition from fish to tetrapods and they were even able to haul out on land. According to Shultze and Trueb, Panderichthys shares ten features with tetrapods:\n\nThe skull roof is flat compared to fish skulls.\nThe orbits are more dorsal and lie closer together.\nThe external naris is close to the margin of the upper jaw.\nFrontals are paired.\nThere is no external intracranial joint.\nThe parietal bone is located between the orbits and main portion posterior to orbits.\nIn  P. rhombolepis, the squamosal touches the maxilla (varies among specimens though).\nThe teeth have a complex polyplocodont structure.\nA lack of median fins.\nIn panderichthyids and Ichthyostega, the ribs are attached to the neural arch and there is an intercentrum.\n\n\n=== Humerus ===\nOne of the key transitional features of Panderichthys is its humerus. During the transition from fish to tetrapods the limbs began to move and became located at a right angle to the body rather than be\nRhizodontida is an extinct group of predatory tetrapodomorphs known from many areas of the world from the Givetian through to the Pennsylvanian - the earliest known species is about 377 million years ago (Mya), the latest around 310 Mya. Rhizodonts lived in tropical rivers and freshwater lakes and were the dominant predators of their age. They reached huge sizes - the largest known species, Rhizodus hibberti from Europe and North America, was an estimated 7 m in length, making it the largest freshwater fish known.\n\n\n== Description ==\n \nThe upper jaw had a marginal row of small teeth on the maxilla and premaxilla, medium-sized fangs on the ectopterygoid and dermopalatine bones, and large tusks on the vomers and premaxillae. On the lower jaw were marginal teeth on the dentary, with fangs on the three coronoids and a huge tusk at the symphysial tip of the dentary. Apparently, the left and right mandibles rotated inwards towards each other on biting. This may have been a kinetic mechanism to dig the marginal teeth more deeply into the prey, to help grip slippery or struggling items.\nThe trunk was elongated, with pelvic, two dorsal and anal fins much reduced and placed posteriorly The anal and second dorsal fins formed a functional part of the tail. The lateral line system was elaborated on the skull and pectoral girdle - in Strepsodus the main trunk lateral line also had several subsidiary lines running parallel to it. This probably helped rhizodonts detect prey in the turbid, swampy environments where they lived.\nRhizodont pelvic fins are known only from external morphology. They are smaller than the pectoral fins and positioned toward the rear of the body. In comparison to the other fins, the pectoral fins were much enlarged. They had a well-developed internal skeleton surrounded by robust, largely unsegmented lepidotrichia; the whole fin was then covered in deeply overlapping scales. This turned the pectoral fin into a broad paddle.\n\n\n== Phylogeny ==\nThe cladogram presented below is based on a 2021 study by Clement and colleagues:\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nJudging from their anatomy, rhizodonts had an extremely powerful bite. They probably employed a 'grip and drag' hunting technique, where prey was ambushed, the tusks sunk in to secure it, and then depending on its size, either thrashed on the surface to subdue it, or dragged to where the rhizodont could consume it without being disturbed. Their prey probably included large sharks, lungfish, and other lobe-finned fishes, and even tetrapods, because all tetrapods at this time still had to lay their eggs in water.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nJohanson, Z. & Ahlberg, P.E.

Tiktaalik is estimated to have had a total length of 1.25–2.75 metres (4.1–9.0 ft) based on various specimens.\nUnearthed in Arctic Canada, Tiktaalik is a non-tetrapod member of Osteichthyes (bony fish), complete with scales and gills—but it has a triangular, flattened head and unusual, cleaver-shaped fins. Its fins have thin ray bones for paddling like most fish, but they also have sturdy interior bones that would have allowed Tiktaalik to prop itself up in shallow water and use its limbs for support as most four-legged animals do. Those fins and other mixed characteristics mark Tiktaalik as a crucial transition fossil, a link in evolution from swimming fish to four-legged vertebrates. This and similar animals might be the common ancestors of all vertebrate terrestrial fauna: amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals.\nThe first Tiktaalik fossils were found in 2004 on Ellesmere Island in Nunavut, Canada. The discovery, made by Edward B. Daeschler of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Neil H. Shubin from the University of Chicago, and Harvard University Professor Farish A. Jenkins Jr., was published in the April 6, 2006 issue of Nature and quickly recognized as a transitional form.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\n\nIn 2004, three fossilized Tiktaalik skeletons were discovered in the Late Devonian fluvial Fram Formation on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, in northern Canada. Estimated ages were reported at 375 Ma, 379 Ma and 383 Ma. At the time of the species' existence, Ellesmere Island was part of the continent Laurentia (modern eastern North America and Greenland), which was centered on the equator and had a warm climate. When discovered, one of the skulls was found sticking out of a cliff. Upon further inspection, the fossil was found to be in excellent condition for a 375-million-year-old specimen.\nThe discovery by Daeschler, Shubin and Jenkins was published in the April 6, 2006 issue of Nature and quickly recognized as a transitional form. Jennifer A. Clack, a Cambridge University expert on tetrapod evolution, said of Tiktaalik, \"It's one of those things you can point to and say, 'I told you this would exist,' and there it is.\" \n\n \nAfter five years of digging on Ellesmere Island, in the far north of Nunavut, they hit pay dirt: a collection of several fish so beautifully preserved that their skeletons were still intact. As Shubin's team studied the species they saw to their excitement that it was exactly the missing intermediate they were looking for. 'We found something that really split the difference right down the middle,' says Daeschler.\nTiktaalik is an Inuktitut word meaning \"large freshwater fish\". The \"fishapod\" genus received this name after a suggestion by Inuit elders of Canada's Nunavut Territory, where the fossil was discovered. The specific name roseae honours an anonymous donor. Taking a detailed look at the internal head skeleton of Tiktaalik roseae, in the October 16, 2008, issue of Nature, researchers show how Tiktaalik was gaining structures that could allow it to support itself on solid ground and breathe air, a key intermediate step in the transformation of the skull that accompanied the shift to life on land by our distant ancestors. More than 60 specimens of Tiktaalik have been discovered, though the holotype remains the most complete and well-described fossil.\n\n\n== Description ==\nTiktaalik provides insights on the features of the extinct closest relatives of the tetrapods. Tiktaalik was a large fish: the largest known fossils have an estimated length of 2.75 m (9.02 feet), with the longest lower jaws reaching a length of 31 centimetres (1.0 ft).\n\n\n=== Skull and neck ===\n The skull of Tiktaalik was low and flat, more similar in shape to that of a crocodile than most fish. The rear ed\nRhizodus (root tooth) is an extinct genus of basal, finned tetrapodomorphs (the group of sarcopterygians that contains modern tetrapods and their extinct relatives). It belonged to Rhizodontida, one of the earliest-diverging tetrapodomorph clades. Two valid species have been described, both of which lived during the Early Carboniferous epoch. The type species R. hibberti is known from the Viséan stage of the United Kingdom, whereas the species R. serpukhovensis is from the Serpukhovian of Russia. Some fossils referred to the genus Rhizodus have also been found in North America.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe most notable characteristics of Rhizodus, compared to other giant rhizodonts such as Barameda, were the two 22-centimetre (8.7 in) fangs located near the front of its jaws, followed by other teeth scaling downwards in size. Rhizodus was a giant apex predator that resided in freshwater lakes, river systems and large swamps, with R. hibberti measuring 5.14–5.63 metres (16.9–18.5 ft) long and weighing 1–1.5 metric tons (1.1–1.7 short tons). It fed on small to medium-sized amphibians, using its teeth to kill prey and rip it into digestible sizes, rather than swallowing prey whole like other, smaller-toothed sarcopterygians.\nFossil skin imprints show that Rhizodus had large, plate-like scales, similar to those found on modern day arapaima.\n\n\n== Diet ==\nThe diet of Rhizodus' included medium-sized fish and tetrapods. It has been proposed that Rhizodus lunged at terrestrial, shorebound prey, just like a modern-day crocodile.\n\n\n== References ==\nReptiliomorpha (meaning reptile-shaped; in PhyloCode known as Pan-Amniota) is a clade containing the amniotes and those tetrapods that share a more recent common ancestor with amniotes than with living amphibians (lissamphibians). It was defined by Michel Laurin (2001) and Vallin and Laurin (2004) as the largest clade that includes Homo sapiens, but not Ascaphus truei (tailed frog). Laurin and Reisz (2020) defined Pan-Amniota as the largest total clade containing Homo sapiens, but not Pipa pipa, Caecilia tentaculata, and Siren lacertina.\nThe informal variant of the name, \"reptiliomorphs\", is also occasionally used to refer to stem-amniotes, i.e. a grade of reptile-like tetrapods that are more closely related to amniotes than they are to lissamphibians, but are not amniotes themselves; the name is used in this meaning e.g. by Ruta, Coates and Quicke (2003). An alternative name, \"Anthracosauria\", is also commonly used for the group, but is confusingly also used for a more primitive grade of reptiliomorphs (Embolomeri) by Benton. While both anthracosaurs and/or embolomeres are suggested to be reptiliomorphs closer to amniotes, some recent studies either retain them as amphibians or argue that their relationships are still ambiguous and are more likely to be stem-tetrapods.\nAs the exact phylogenetic position of Lissamphibia within Tetrapoda remains uncertain, it also remains controversial which fossil tetrapods are more closely related to amniotes than to lissamphibians, and thus, which ones of them were reptiliomorphs in any meaning of the word. The two major hypotheses for lissamphibian origins are that they are either descendants of dissorophoid temnospondyls or microsaurian \"lepospondyls\". If the former (the \"temnospondyl hypothesis\") is true, then Reptiliomorpha includes all tetrapod groups that are closer to amniotes than to temnospondyls. These include the diadectomorphs, seymouriamorphs, most or all \"lepospondyls\", gephyrostegids, and possibly the embolomeres and chroniosuchians. In addition, several \"anthracosaur\" genera of uncertain taxonomic placement would also probably qualify as reptiliomorphs, including Solenodonsaurus, Eldeceeon, Silvanerpeton, and Casineria. However, if lissamphibians originated among the lepospondyls according to the \"lepospondyl hypothesis\", then Reptiliomorpha refers to groups that are closer to amniotes than to lepospondyls. Few non-amniote groups would count as reptiliomorphs under this definition, although the diadectomorphs are among those that qualify.\n\n\n== Changing definitions ==\nThe name Reptiliomorpha was coined by Professor Gunnar Säve-Söderbergh in 1934 to designate amniotes and various types of late Paleozoic tetrapods that were more closely related to amniotes than to living amphibians. In his view, the amphibians had evolved from fish twice, with one group composed of the ancestors of modern salamanders and the other, which Säve-Söderbergh referred to as Eutetrapoda, consisting of anurans (frogs), amniotes, and their ancestors, with the origin of caecilians being uncertain. Säve-Söderbergh's Eutetrapoda consisted of two sister-groups: Batrachomorpha, containing anurans and their ancestors, and Reptiliomorpha, containing anthracosaurs and amniotes. Säve-Söderbergh subsequently added Seymouriamorpha to his Reptiliomorpha as well.\nAlfred Sherwood Romer rejected Säve-Söderbergh's theory of a biphyletic amphibia and used the name Anthracosauria to describe the \"labyrinthodont\" lineage from which amniotes evolved. In 1970, the German paleontologist Alec Panchen took up Säve-Söderbergh's name for this group as having priority, but Romer's terminology is still in use, e.g. by Carroll (1988 and 2002) and by Hildebrand & Goslow (2001). Some writers preferring phylogenetic nomenclature use Anthracosauria.\nIn 1956, Friedrich von Huene included both amphibians and anapsid reptiles in the Reptiliomorpha. This included the following orders: Anthracosauria, Seymouriamorpha, Microsauria, Diadectomo\nLepospondyli is a diverse taxon of early tetrapods. With the exception of one late-surviving lepospondyl from the Late Permian of Morocco (Diplocaulus minimus), lepospondyls lived from the Visean stage of the Early Carboniferous to the Early Permian and were geographically restricted to what is now Europe and North America. Five major groups of lepospondyls are known: Adelospondyli; Aïstopoda; Lysorophia; Microsauria; and Nectridea. Lepospondyls have a diverse range of body forms and include species with newt-like, eel- or snake-like, and lizard-like forms. Various species were aquatic, semiaquatic, or terrestrial. None were large (the biggest genus, the diplocaulid Diplocaulus, reached a meter in length, but most were much smaller), and they are assumed to have lived in specialized ecological niches not taken by the more numerous temnospondyl amphibians that coexisted with them in the Paleozoic. \nLepospondyli was named in 1888 by Karl Alfred von Zittel, who coined the name to include some tetrapods from the Paleozoic that shared some specific characteristics in the notochord and teeth. Lepospondyls have sometimes been considered to be either related or ancestral to modern amphibians or to Amniota (the clade containing reptiles and mammals). It has been suggested that the grouping is polyphyletic, with aïstopods being primitive stem-tetrapods, while recumbirostran microsaurs are primitive reptiles.\n\n\n== Description ==\nAll lepospondyls are characterised by having simple, spool-shaped vertebrae that did not ossify from cartilage, but rather grew as bony cylinders around the notochord. In addition, the upper portion of the vertebra, the neural arch, is usually fused to the centrum (the main body of the vertebra).\n\n\n== Classification ==\nThe position of the Lepospondyli within the Tetrapoda is uncertain because the earliest lepospondyls were already highly specialized when they first appeared in the fossil record. Some lepospondyls were once thought to be related or perhaps ancestral to modern salamanders (Urodela), but not the other modern amphibians. This view is no longer held and all modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians) are now grouped within the clade Lissamphibia. For a long time, the Lepospondyli were considered one of the three subclasses of Amphibia, along with the Lissamphibia and the Labyrinthodontia. However, the dissolution of \"labyrinthodonts\" into separate groups such as temnospondyls and anthracosaurs has cast doubt on these traditional amphibian subclasses.  Much like \"Labyrinthodontia\", some studies proposed that Lepospondyli is an artificial (polyphyletic) grouping with some members closely related to extinct stem tetrapod groups and others more closely related to modern amphibians or reptiles. Early phylogenetic analyses conducted in the 1980s and 1990s often maintained the idea that lepospondyls were paraphyletic, with nectrideans close to colosteids and microsaurs close to temnospondyls, which were considered to be ancestral to modern amphibians.\nHowever, a 1995 paper by Robert Carroll argued that lepospondyls were actually a monophyletic group closer to reptiles. Carroll considered them closer to reptiles than the seymouriamorphs, but not as close as the diadectomorphs. Many phylogenetic analyses since Carroll (1995) agreed with his interpretation, including Laurin & Reisz (1997),  Anderson (2001), and Ruta et al. (2003). A few have still considered lepospondyls ancestral to amphibians, but came to this conclusion without changing the position of lepospondyls compared to seymouriamorphs and diadectomorphs.\nLepospondyl and tetrapod classification is still controversial, and even recent studies have had doubts about lepospondyl monophyly. For example, a 2007 paper has suggested that adelospondyls are stem-tetrapods close to colosteids and a 2017 paper on Lethiscus has  Aïstopoda in the tetrapod stem based on their primitive braincase. These studies differ in the internal and external relations\nAnthracosaurus is an extinct genus of embolomere that lived during the Late Carboniferous (around 315 million years ago) in what is now Scotland, England, and Ohio. Measuring around 10 ft (3.0 m) long, it was a large, aquatic eel-like predator. It has a robust skull about 40 centimetres (1.3 ft) in length with large teeth in the jaws and on the roof of the mouth. Anthracosaurus probably inhabited swamps, rivers and lakes. Its name is Greek for \"coal lizard\".\n\n\n== Discovery and specimens ==\n\n\n=== Scotland ===\nThe genus and type species Anthracosaurus russelli were named by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1863, based on fossils acquired by mining surveyor James Russell in 1861. Nearly all fossils were found near Airdrie, in the historic County Lanarkshire of Scotland. Geologically speaking, they hail from the Blackband Ironstone of the Scottish Middle Coal Measures. In traditional European stratigraphy, this layer would be dated to the Westphalian B, corresponding to the early-middle part of the Pennsylvanian (Late Carboniferous). The holotype is a large flattened cranium embedded in an ironstone nodule. Due to the tough mineral encrustation, it would take more than a century for the skull to be fully prepared and cleared of matrix. Subsequent to Huxley's original description, incremental preparation allowed for the skull to be redescribed by Watson (1929) and later Panchen (1977). Other fossils from Airdrie include lower jaw fragments, teeth, vertebrae, and possibly a partial interclavicle. It is uncertain whether the postcranial fossils truly belong to Anthracosaurus. The vertebrae are undiagnostic beyond their embolomerous form, while the interclavicle shows similarity to that of Pholiderpeton.\n\n\n=== England ===\nA second, less complete skull from Washington (in the historic County Durham of England) was assigned to Anthracosaurus russelli by Panchen et al. (1967). It is slightly older than the Scottish fossils, dating to the Lower Coal Measures (Westphalian A). Panchen (1981) expanded the list of English fossils with an incomplete jaw stored in the Hancock Museum, possibly from the Lower Main Seam of Newsham, Northumberland (Westphalian B). Clack (1987) described two additional Anthracosaurus fossils from Newsham: a partial skull roof (previously referred to Pteroplax cornuta or Eogyrinus attheyi) and an isolated jugal bone.\n\n\n=== Ohio ===\nRomer (1963) showed that the tooth of an animal that J. S. Newberry named \"Rhizodus lancifer,\" from the Diamond Coal Mine, a Carboniferous site in Linton, Ohio, belonged to a species of Anthracosaurus. Now known as Anthracosaurus lancifer, this species is represented by a collection of isolated teeth, vertebrae, and molds of a snout and shoulder girdle. The snout shows enlarged premaxillary teeth, but this trait is present in other American embolomeres like Eobaphetes and Neopteroplax. Another embolomere described from Linton, Leptophractus obsoletus, probably represents an early growth phase of Anthracosaurus lancifer.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nClassification of Anthracosaurus\nHarajicadectes (IPA: [ˌhɑːɾɑːdʒɪkɑːˈdektes]) (meaning \"Harajica biter\") is a genus of stem-tetrapod from the Givetian to Frasnian Amadeus Basin in Northern Territory, Australia. The type and only species is Harajicadectes zhumini, known from 13 specimens of various preservation quality.\n\n\n== Description ==\nChoo et al., (2024) assigned a holotype and paratype to Harajicadectes, NTM P6410, and CPC 39948 respectively. The holotype consists of a partial skull and much of the body outline in dorsal view with squamation preserved. The paratype consists of a partial skull, right post-temporal and right lower jaw.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe generic name, Harajicadectes (IPA: [ˌhɑːɾɑːdʒɪkɑːˈdektes]), is derived from the member the specimens were found in, the Harajica Sandstone Member, and the Greek 'dēktēs', which translates to 'biter'. The specific name, zhumini (IPA: [ˌzjuˈmɪnaɪ]), honours Prof. Min Zhu of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Beijing; China, for his numerous contributions to early vertebrate paleontology.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nChoo et al., (2024) recovered Harajicadectes as a stem-tetrapod. They reconstructed two trees collated from 336 most parsimonious trees. The first tree is a strict consensus tree, the numbers represent Bremer support values. The second tree is a 50% majority-rule consensus tree, the numbers are node support bootstrap values. Their results are reproduced below:\n\n\n== References ==\nTetrapodomorpha (also known as Choanata) is a clade of vertebrates consisting of tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) and their closest sarcopterygian relatives that are more closely related to living tetrapods than to living lungfish. Advanced forms transitional between fish and the early labyrinthodonts, such as Tiktaalik, have been referred to as \"fishapods\" by their discoverers, being half-fish, half-tetrapods, in appearance and limb morphology. The Tetrapodomorpha contains the crown group tetrapods (the last common ancestor of living tetrapods and all of its descendants) and several groups of early stem tetrapods, which includes several groups of related lobe-finned fishes, collectively known as the osteolepiforms. The Tetrapodomorpha minus the crown group Tetrapoda are the stem Tetrapoda, a paraphyletic unit encompassing the fish to tetrapod transition.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nAmong the characteristics defining tetrapodomorphs are modifications to the fins, notably a humerus with convex head articulating with the glenoid fossa (the socket of the shoulder joint). Another key trait is the internal nostril or choana. Most fish have two pairs of nostrils, one on either side of the head for incoming water (incurrent nostrils) and another pair for outgoing water (excurrent nostrils). In early tetrapodomorphs like Kenichthys, the excurrent nostrils had shifted towards the mouth's perimeter. In later tetrapodomorphs, including tetrapods, the excurrent nostril is positioned inside the mouth, where it is known as the choana. The nearly-equivalent clade Choanata often refers to these later forms specifically.\n\n\n== History ==\nTetrapodomorph fossils are known from the early Devonian onwards, and include Osteolepis, Panderichthys, Kenichthys and Tungsenia. Tetrapodomorpha evolved from ancient lobe-finned fish (sarcopterygians) around 390 million years ago in the Middle Devonian period.\n\n\n== Classification ==\n\n\n=== Taxonomy ===\nAfter Benton, 2004; and Swartz, 2012.\n\nSubclass Sarcopterygii\nInfraclass Tetrapodomorpha\nOrder †Rhizodontida\nFamily †Sauripteridae\nFamily †Rhizodontidae\nSuperorder †Osteolepidida (or Osteolepiformes)\nFamily †Canowindridae\nFamily †Thysanolepidae\nFamily †Tristichopteridae\nOrder †Osteolepiformes (or Megalichthyiformes)\nFamily †Osteolepidae\nFamily †Megalichthyidae\nClade Eotetrapodiformes\nClade Elpistostegalia (or Panderichthyida)\nClade Stegocephalia\nFamily †Elpistostegidae\nFamily †Whatcheeriidae\nFamily †Colosteidae\nSuperfamily †Baphetoidea\nSuperclass Tetrapoda\nOther clades include the Eotetrapodiformes (Tinirau, Platycephalichthys, the Tristichopteridae and Elpistostegalia). Older taxa which include late stem tetrapods and early tetrapods are the Labyrinthodontia and Ichthyostegalia.\n\n\n=== Relationships ===\nThe cladogram is based on a phylogenetic analysis of 46 taxa using 204 characters by B. Swartz in 2012.\n\nThe following cladogram follows the results found by Clement et al. (2021).\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nElpistostegalia is a clade containing Panderichthys and all more derived tetrapodomorph taxa. The earliest elpistostegalians, combining fishlike and tetrapod-like characters, such as Tiktaalik, are sometimes called fishapods. Although historically Elpistostegalia (referred to as Panderichthyida) was considered an order of prehistoric lobe-finned fishes, it was cladistically redefined to include tetrapods.\n\n\n== Paleobiology ==\nA rise in global oxygen content allowed for the evolution of large, predatory fish that were able to exploit the shallow tidal areas and swamplands as top predators. Several groups evolved to fill these niches, the most successful were the elpistiostegalians. In such environments, they would have been challenged by periodic oxygen deficiency.  In comparable modern aquatic environments like shallow eutrophic lakes and swampland, modern lungfish and some genera of catfish also rely on the more stable, atmospheric source of oxygen.\nBeing shallow-water fishes, the elpistostegalians evolved many of the basic adaptions that later allowed the tetrapods to become terrestrial animals. The most important ones were the shift of main propulsion apparatus from the tail fin to the pectoral and pelvic fins, and a shift to reliance on lungs rather than gills as the main means of obtaining oxygen. Both of these appear to be a direct result of moving to an inland freshwater mode of living.\nFossils of Panderichthys are dated to the Givetian (around 385 million years old) or the Frasnian (around 380–375 million years old).  Thus, the oldest bone remains of elpistostegalians appear in the late Middle Devonian or in the early Late Devonian. However, a series of trace fossils from the early Middle Devonian of Poland suggests that tetrapod-limbed animals may have existed as early as in the Eifelian, around 395 million years ago.\n\n\n== Traits ==\nPaleontologist and professor Per E. Ahlberg has identified the following traits as synapomorphic for Elpistostegalia (and thus Tetrapoda):\n\nThe endocranium is hinged, the hinge forming the profundus nerve foramen. The cranial kinesis is also visible in the skull roof, between the parietal bones and the postparietal bones.\nA rather small shoulder girdle is present.\nThe anal and posterior dorsal fin supported by a basal plate and three unjointed radials.\nThe pectoral fin skeleton is composed of bones homologous to the tetrapod humerus, ulna, and radius, followed by a host of smaller bones anchoring the fin rays; the pelvic fin skeleton similarly has femur, tibia, and fibula.\n\n\n== Phylogeny ==\nThe name, originally coined around the genus Elpistostege, later become a synonym for Panderichthyida. In most analyses, the group as traditionally imagined is actually an evolutionary grade, the last \"fishes\" of the tetrapod stem line, though Chang and Yu (1997) treated them as the sister clade to Tetrapoda. Elpistostegalia was re-defined as a clade containing Panderichthys and tetrapods.\nBelow is a cladogram from Swartz, 2012.\n\nThe 2020 study by Cloutier et al. revealed that the paired fins of Elpistostege contained bones homologous to the phalanges (digit bones) of modern tetrapods. The analysis carried out in this study recovered Elpistostege as the sister taxon of all unequivocally digited vertebrates.\n\n\n== References ==\nAdelospondyli is an order of elongated, presumably aquatic, Carboniferous amphibians (sensu lato). They have a robust skull roofed with solid bone, and orbits located towards the front of the skull.  The limbs were almost certainly absent, although some historical sources reported them to be present. Despite the likely absence of limbs, adelospondyls retained a large part of the bony shoulder girdle. Adelospondyls have been assigned to a variety of groups in the past. They have traditionally been seen as members of the subclass Lepospondyli, related to other unusual early tetrapods such as \"microsaurs\", \"nectrideans\", and aïstopods. Analyses such as Ruta & Coates (2007) have offered an alternate classification scheme, arguing that adelospondyls were actually far removed from other lepospondyls, instead being stem-tetrapod stegocephalians closely related to the family Colosteidae.\nMost adelospondyls belong to the family Adelogyrinidae, and prior to 2003 the order and family were considered synonymous. In 2003, Ruta et al. assigned Acherontiscus to the order as the only known non-adelogyrinid member. Members of this group are very rare; only six known specimens can be assigned to the five known genera with absolute confidence. These specimens are known from Mississippian (Serpukhovian Age) geological deposits in Scotland, and they were among the oldest \"lepospondyls\" known from fossils.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nAdelospondyls share a variety of traits with other lepospondyls, although whether these traits are an example of convergent evolution is a controversial topic. Like the aïstopods and lysorophian \"microsaurs\", they had very elongated bodies similar to that of snakes and eels. In addition, they lacked limbs (similarly to the aïstopods), although forelimbs were supposedly found in various adelogyrinids in the late 1960s. Andrews & Carroll (1991) found that all cases of forelimb bones in adelogyrinids were actually misinterpretations. For example, putative forelimbs discovered in Adelogyrinus and Palaeomolgophis by Brough & Brough (1967) were re-identified as hyoid bones and ribs, respectively. Carroll (1967) also claimed that forelimbs were present in Adelospondylus, but these later considered to be hyoids as in Adelogyrinus.\n\n\n=== Skull ===\nAdelospondyls had somewhat long and low skulls, with large orbits (eye sockets) shifted towards the front of the skull. As a result, the proportions of the skull bones were affected. For example, the nasal bones along the midline of the skull in front of the eyes were much shorter than the frontal bones directly behind them, which extended forwards past the level of the eyes. The frontal bones were omitted from the edge of the orbits (eye holes) due to a contact between the pre- and post-frontals which typically lie in front of and behind the orbits, respectively. Unlike lysorophians and aïstopods, which had snake-like skulls with large openings and reduced bone material, adelospondyl skulls were strongly built and covered with ridges, pits, and grooves, including lateral line sulci. They typically possessed many teeth, although such teeth differ in structure between families. Adelogyrinids, for example, had many numerous \"chisel-shaped\" teeth, while Acherontiscus had blunt teeth at the back of the mouth and sharp, thin teeth at the front. As is the case in other lepospondyls, the teeth of adelospondyls did not have a  maze-like internal structure like those of \"labyrinthodonts\", nor did adelospondyls possess enlarged fang-like teeth on the roof of the mouth.\n\nSimilar to various other lepospondyls, adelospondyls lost several bones in the temporal region of the skull, which is at the back of the skull between the quadratojugal bone of the jaw joint and the parietal and postparietal bones at the midline of the skull roof. Stem- and crown-tetrapods typically have three to four bones on each side of the skull in this region (from top to bottom): the tabular, supratemporal (and sometimes an adjac\nHynerpeton ( lit. 'creeping animal from Hyner') is an extinct genus of early four-limbed vertebrate that lived in the rivers and ponds of Pennsylvania during the Late Devonian period, around 365 to 363 million years ago. The only known species of Hynerpeton is H. bassetti, named after the describer's grandfather, city planner Edward Bassett. Hynerpeton is known for being the first Devonian four-limbed vertebrate discovered in the United States, as well as possibly being one of the first to have lost internal (fish-like) gills.\nThis genus is known from few remains discovered at the Red Hill fossil site in Hyner, Pennsylvania. The most notable fossil is a large endochondral shoulder girdle consisting of the cleithrum, scapula, and coracoid (but not the interclavicle and clavicles), all connected into one shoulder bone. The inner surface of this shoulder bone possesses an array of depressions believed to have been attachment points for a unique set of powerful muscles around the chest. This may have given Hynerpeton improved mobility and weight-bearing abilities compared to other Devonian limbed vertebrates such as Ichthyostega and Acanthostega. The cleithrum (upper blade of the shoulder) is fused to the scapulocoracoid (lower plate of the shoulder, in front of the shoulder socket), unlike in most tetrapods. Conversely, the shoulder girdle is independent of the skull, unlike in most fish.\nEarly four-limbed vertebrates are often referred to as tetrapods, according to a trait-based definition of the term as commonly used by most paleontologists. Devonian animals like Hynerpeton, Ichthyostega, and Acanthostega are excluded from the crown group Tetrapoda, since they evolved prior to the common ancestor of modern amphibians (Lissamphibia), reptiles, mammals, and birds. For specialists who prefer a neontological definition of tetrapods (i.e., only in the context of modern life), alternative terms for non-crown tetrapods include \"stem-tetrapod\" or \"stegocephalian\".\nHynerpeton hails from the Red Hill fossil site, which, during the Late Devonian, was a warm floodplain inhabited by a diverse ecosystem of aquatic fish and terrestrial invertebrates. Hynerpeton was one of several genera of four-limbed vertebrates known from the site, although it was the first to be discovered. Some paleontologists have proposed that animals like Hynerpeton made use their amphibious lifestyle to find shallow pools where they could spawn, isolated from predatory fish which inhabited the deeper rivers.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1993, paleontologists Edward \"Ted\" Daeschler and Neil Shubin found the first Hynerpeton fossil at the Red Hill fossil site near Hyner, Pennsylvania, USA. They were surveying the Devonian rocks of Pennsylvania in search of fossil evidence for the origin of limbed vertebrates. This initial find was a robust left endochondral shoulder girdle, belonging to an animal which had powerful appendages. This fossil, designated ANSP 20053, is now considered the holotype specimen of Hynerpeton, which Daeschler and his colleagues formally named in an article published by Science Magazine in 1994. At the time of its discovery, Hynerpeton was the oldest four-limbed vertebrate known from the United States, and its presence in a complex ecosystem such as that preserved at Red Hill helped to answer some of Daeschler and Shubin's questions on the origin and lifestyle of limbed vertebrates. The generic name Hynerpeton is in reference to Hyner and herpeton (\"creeping animal\"), a Greek word which is commonly used as a suffix for newly named ancient amphibians. The specific name, bassetti, is named in honor of Edward M. Bassett, an American city planner and Daeschler's grandfather.\nThe most fossiliferous layer of the Red Hill site, the \"Hynerpeton lens\", was named after the genus. It is believed to have been deposited during the Middle to Upper Famennian stage, about 365 to 363 million years ago. Since 1993, more stegocephalian remains have been found in the Hynerpeton\nProterogyrinus is an extinct genus of early tetrapods from the order Embolomeri. Fossil remains of Proterogyrinus have been found in Scotland, UK, and West Virginia, United States, and date back to the Serpukhovian (mid-Carboniferous period), which is from about 331 to 323 million years ago. The genus was originally named by renowned vertebrate paleontologist Alfred Sherwood Romer in 1970. A comprehensive redescription was later published by Canadian paleontologist Robert Holmes in 1984. The generic name \"Proterogyrinus\" is Greek for \"earlier wanderer\" or \"earlier tadpole\". This name was chosen by Romer in keeping with a trend of naming long-bodied early tetrapods (such as Eogyrinus and Crassigyrinus) with the suffix \"-gyrinus\".\nRomer hesitated from designating Proterogyrinus as a true embolomere, because its intercentra (the forward portion of each vertebra) were smaller than its pleurocentra (the rear portion). He used the group Anthracosauria to encompass embolomeres and their close relatives such as Proterogyrinus. However, other sources prefer a wider definition of Embolomeri similar in usage to Romer's Anthracosauria, thus counting Proterogyrinus as an embolomere.\n\n\n== Description ==\nIn most respects Proterogyrinus resembled other embolomeres such as Archeria, with a moderately elongated skull that was taller than that of other early tetrapods such as colosteids and temnospondyls. Members of the genus had strong limbs with several fully-ossified ankle and wrist bones. This would have given Proterogyrinus the ability to walk and hunt on land. However, the presence of lateral line grooves and otic notches which likely held spiracles show that they were probably more well-adapted for the water. The tail was long and tall, and was likely a powerful method of locomotion. The eyes were positioned high on the skull, supporting the idea that Proterogyrinus had an active lifestyle near the surface of the water.\n\n\n== References ==",

The stapes bone at the rear of the skull is massive, probably used as a support for the skull. This contrasts with the stapes of terrestrial animals such as frogs, mammals, and lizards. In these groups the bone is thin and sensitive to vibration, so it is used for sensitive hearing. The thick stapes of Greererpeton is an indication that did not have good hearing like terrestrial animals. Greererpeton retains a postbranchial lamina on its shoulder blade, which may have been indicative of internal gills like those of fish.

This, combined with other cranial and post-cranial elements of Ventastega, made researchers predict that it was larger than Ichthyostega. The mandible is widest anterior to the first coronoid fang. The dentary is long and shallow, and has a butt joint as the contact with the coronoid series, indicating the dentary is loosely attached to the jaw. Similar to some tetrapods such as Acanthostega and Tulerpeton, the dentary's lateral surface is ornamented on the dorsal side with a smooth section only on the ventral margin. Another lower jaw specimen (LDM 81/552) is the only known complete Ventastega dentary, and shows Ventastega had 89 marginal teeth on each side of the jaw that are all approximately the same size, although they decrease in height as you move distally."

In this end-Devonian extinction, most marine and freshwater groups became extinct or were reduced to a few lineages, although the precise mechanism of the extinction is unclear. Before the event, oceans and lakes were dominated by lobe-finned fishes and armored fishes called placoderms. After the gap, modern ray finned fish, as well as sharks and their relatives were the dominant forms. The period also saw the demise of the Ichthyostegalia, the early fish-like amphibians with more than five digits."

Once the number of shell-crushing ray-finned fishes and sharks increased later in the Carboniferous, coincident with the end of Romer's gap, the diversity of crinoids with Devonian-type armor plummeted, following the pattern of a classic predator-prey (Lotka-Volterra) cycle.

Archived from the original on April 5, 2023.\nIchthyostega (from Greek: ἰχθῦς ikhthûs, 'fish' and Greek: στέγη stégē, 'roof') is an extinct genus of limbed tetrapodomorphs from the Late Devonian of what is now Greenland. It was among the earliest four-limbed vertebrates ever in the fossil record and was one of the first with weight-bearing adaptations for terrestrial locomotion. Ichthyostega possessed lungs and limbs that helped it navigate through shallow water in swamps. Although Ichthyostega is often labelled a 'tetrapod' because of its limbs and fingers, it evolved long before true crown group tetrapods and could more accurately be referred to as a stegocephalian or stem tetrapod. Likewise, while undoubtedly of amphibian build and habit, it is not a true member of the group in the narrow sense, as the first modern amphibians (members of the group Lissamphibia) appeared in the Triassic Period. Until finds of other early stegocephalians and closely related fishes in the late 20th century, Ichthyostega stood alone as a transitional fossil between fish and tetrapods, combining fish and tetrapod features. Newer research has shown that it had an unusual anatomy, functioning more akin to a seal than a salamander, as previously assumed.\n\n\n== History ==\n \nIn 1932 Gunnar Säve-Söderbergh described four Ichthyostega species from the Late Devonian of East Greenland and one species belonging to the genus Ichthyostegopsis, I. wimani. These species could be synonymous (in which case only I. stensioei would remain), because their morphological differences are not very pronounced. The species differ in skull proportions, skull punctuation and skull bone patterns. The comparisons were done on 14 specimens collected in 1931 by the Danish East Greenland Expedition. Additional specimens were collected between 1933 and 1955.\n\n\n== Description ==\nIchthyostega was a fairly large animal for its time, as it was broadly built and about 1.5 m (4.9 ft) long. The skull was low, with dorsally placed eyes and large labyrinthodont teeth. The posterior margin of the skull formed an operculum covering the gills. The spiracle was situated in an otic notch behind each eye. Computed tomography has revealed that Ichthyostega had a specialized ear, including a stapes with a unique morphology compared to other tetrapods or to any fish hyomandibula. \n\n\n=== Postcranial skeleton ===\nThe legs were large compared to contemporary relatives. It had seven digits on each hind leg, along with a peculiar, poorly ossified mass which lies anteriorly adjacent to the digits. The exact number of digits on the forelimb is not yet known, since fossils of the hand have not been found. While in water, the foot would have functioned like a fleshy paddle more than a fin.The vertebral column and ribcage of Ichthyostega was unusual and highly specialized relative to both its contemporaries and later tetrapods. The thoracic vertebrae at the front of the trunk and the short neck have tall neural spines that lean backwards. They attach to pointed ribs which increase in size and acquire prominent overlapping flanges. Past the sixth or seventh flanged rib, the ribs abruptly decrease in size and lose their flanges. The lumbar vertebrae at the back of the trunk have strong muscle scars and neural spines which are bent forwards and decrease in size towards the hips. The sacral vertebrae above the hips have fan-shaped neural spines that transition from forward-leaning to backward-leaning as they approach the tail. The vertebrae right behind the hips have unusually large ribs similar to those of the thoracic region. The caudal vertebrae have slender spines that lean backwards. The tail of Ichthyostega retained a low fin supported by bony lepidotrichia (fin rays). The tail fin was not as deep as in Acanthostega, and would have been less useful for swimming.\n\nIchthyostega is related to Acanthostega gunnari, which is also from what is now East Greenland. Ichthyostega's skull seems more fish-like than that of Acanthostega, but its pelvic girdle mo\nAcanthostega (meaning \"spiny roof\") is an extinct genus of stem-tetrapod, among the first vertebrate animals to have recognizable limbs. It appeared in the late Devonian period (Famennian age) about 365 million years ago, and was anatomically intermediate between lobe-finned fishes and those that were fully capable of coming onto land.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\n \nThe fossilized remains are generally well preserved, with the famous fossil by which the significance of this species  was discovered being found by Jennifer A. Clack in East Greenland in 1987, though fragments of the skull had been discovered in 1933 by Gunnar Säve-Söderbergh and Erik Jarvik.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe 60 cm (24 in) Acanthostega had eight digits on each hand (the number of digits on the feet is unclear) linked by webbing, it lacked wrists, and was generally poorly adapted for walking on land. It also had a remarkably fish-like shoulder and forelimb. The front limbs of Acanthostega could not bend forward at the elbow, and  therefore could not be brought into a weight bearing position, appearing to be more suitable for paddling or for holding on to aquatic plants. Acanthostega is the earliest stem-tetrapod to show the shift in locomotory dominance from the pectoral girdle to the pelvic girdle.\nThere are many morphological changes that allowed the pelvic girdle of Acanthostega to become a weight-bearing structure. In more ancestral states the two sides of the girdle were not attached. In Acanthostega there is contact between the two sides and fusion of the girdle with the sacral rib of the vertebral column. These fusions would have made the pelvic region more powerful and equipped to counter the force of gravity when not supported by the buoyancy of an aquatic environment. It had internal gills that were covered like those of fish. It also had lungs, but its ribs were too short to support its chest cavity out of water.\n\n\n== Classification ==\n\nAcanthostega is seen as part of widespread evolutionary radiation in the late Devonian period, starting with purely aquatic finned tetrapodomorphs, with their successors showing increased air-breathing capability and related adaptions to the jaws and gills, as well as more muscular neck allowing freer movement of the head than fish have, and use of the fins to raise the body of the fish. These features are displayed by the earlier Tiktaalik, which like Ichthyostega showed signs of greater abilities to move around on land, but is thought to have been primarily aquatic.\nIn Late Devonian vertebrate speciation, descendants of pelagic lobe-finned fish –like Eusthenopteron– exhibited a sequence of adaptations: Panderichthys, suited to muddy shallows; Tiktaalik with limb-like fins that could take it onto land; stem-tetrapods in weed-filled swamps, such as Acanthostega, which had eight-digited feet; and Ichthyostega, with full limbs. Their descendants also included pelagic lobe-finned fish such as coelacanth species.\n\n\n== Paleobiology ==\n\n\n=== Hunting strategy ===\n\nIt has been inferred that Acanthostega probably lived in shallow, weed-choked swamps, its legs apparently being adapted for these specific ecosystems. Apart from the presence of limbs, it was not adapted in any way for walking on land. Jennifer A. Clack interprets this as showing that Acanthostega was primarily an aquatic animal descended from fish that never left the sea, and that the specializations of the tetrapod lineage were exaptations: features which would later be useful for terrestrial life, even if they originated for a different purpose. At that period, deciduous plants were flourishing and annually shedding leaves into the water, attracting small prey into warm oxygen-poor shallows that were difficult for larger fish to swim in; Clack remarks on how the lower jaw of Acanthostega shows a change from those of fish that have two rows of teeth, with a large number of small teeth in the outer row, and two large fangs and some smaller teeth in the inner row. This di\nRomer's gap is an apparent gap in the Paleozoic tetrapod fossil record used in the study of evolutionary biology, which represent periods from which excavators have not yet found relevant fossils. It is named after American paleontologist Alfred Romer, who first recognised it in 1956. Recent discoveries in Scotland are beginning to close this gap in palaeontological knowledge.\n\n\n== Age ==\nRomer's gap runs from approximately 360 to 345 million years ago, corresponding to the first 15 million years of the Carboniferous, the early Mississippian (starting with the Tournaisian and moving into the Visean). The gap forms a discontinuity between the primitive forests and high diversity of fishes in the end Devonian and more modern aquatic and terrestrial assemblages of the early Carboniferous.\n\n\n== Mechanism behind the gap ==\nThere has been long debate as to why there are so few fossils from this time period. Some have suggested the problem was of fossilization itself, suggesting that there may have been differences in the geochemistry of the time that did not favour fossil formation. Also, excavators simply may not have dug in the right places. The existence of a true low point in vertebrate diversity has been supported by independent lines of evidence, however recent finds in five new locations in Scotland have yielded multiple fossils of early tetrapods and amphibians. They have also allowed the most accurate logging of the geology of this period. This new evidence suggests that - at least locally - there was no gap in diversity or changes in oxygen geochemistry.\nWhile initial arthropod terrestriality was well under way before the gap, and some digited tetrapods might have come on land, there are remarkably few terrestrial or aquatic fossils that date from the gap itself. Recent work on Paleozoic geochemistry has provided evidence for the biological reality of Romer's gap in both terrestrial vertebrates and arthropods, and has correlated it with a period of unusually low atmospheric oxygen concentration, which was determined from the idiosyncratic geochemistry of rocks formed during Romer's gap. The new sedimentary logging in the Ballagan Formation in Scotland challenges this, suggesting oxygen was stable throughout Romer's Gap.\nAquatic vertebrates, which include most tetrapods during the Carboniferous, were recovering from the Hangenberg event, a major extinction event that preceded Romer's gap, one on par with that which killed the dinosaurs. In this end-Devonian extinction, most marine and freshwater groups became extinct or were reduced to a few lineages, although the precise mechanism of the extinction is unclear. Before the event, oceans and lakes were dominated by lobe-finned fishes and armored fishes called placoderms. After the gap, modern ray finned fish, as well as sharks and their relatives were the dominant forms. The period also saw the demise of the Ichthyostegalia, the early fish-like amphibians with more than five digits.\nThe low diversity of marine fishes, particularly shell-crushing predators (durophages), at the beginning of Romer's gap is supported by the sudden abundance of hard-shelled crinoid echinoderms during the same period. The Tournaisian has even been called the \"Age of Crinoids\". Once the number of shell-crushing ray-finned fishes and sharks increased later in the Carboniferous, coincident with the end of Romer's gap, the diversity of crinoids with Devonian-type armor plummeted, following the pattern of a classic predator-prey (Lotka-Volterra) cycle. There is increasing evidence that lungfish and stem tetrapods and amphibians recovered quickly and diversified in the rapidly changing environment of the end-Devonian and Romer's Gap.\n\n\n== Gap fauna ==\n\nThe gap in the tetrapod record has been progressively closed with the discoveries of such early Carboniferous tetrapods as Pederpes and Crassigyrinus. There are a few sites where vertebrate fossils have been found to help fill in the gap, such as the East \nTemnospondyli (from Greek τέμνειν, temnein 'to cut' and σπόνδυλος, spondylos 'vertebra') or temnospondyls is a diverse ancient order of small to giant tetrapods—often considered primitive amphibians—that flourished worldwide during the Carboniferous, Permian and Triassic periods, with fossils being found on every continent. A few species continued into the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous periods, but all had gone extinct by the Late Cretaceous. During about 210 million years of evolutionary history, they adapted to a wide range of habitats, including freshwater, terrestrial, and even coastal marine environments. Their life history is well understood, with fossils known from the larval stage, metamorphosis and maturity. Most temnospondyls were semiaquatic, although some were almost fully terrestrial, returning to the water only to breed. These temnospondyls were some of the first vertebrates fully adapted to life on land. Although temnospondyls are amphibians, many had characteristics such as scales and large armour-like bony plates (osteoderms) that generally distinguish them from the modern soft-bodied lissamphibians (frogs and toads, newts, salamanders and caecilians).\nTemnospondyls have been known since the early 19th century, and were initially thought to be reptiles. They were described at various times as batrachians, stegocephalians and labyrinthodonts, although these names are now rarely used. Animals now grouped in Temnospondyli were spread out among several amphibian groups until the early 20th century, when they were found to belong to a distinct taxon based on the structure of their vertebrae. Temnospondyli means \"cut vertebrae\", as each vertebra is divided into several parts (intercentrum, paired pleurocentra, neural arch), although this occurs widely among other early tetrapods.\nExperts disagree over whether temnospondyls were ancestral to modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians), or whether the whole group died out without leaving any descendants. Different hypotheses have placed modern amphibians as the descendants of temnospondyls, as descendants of another group of early tetrapods called lepospondyls, or even as descendants of both groups (with caecilians evolving from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders evolving from temnospondyls). There is further disagreement about a temnospondyl origin of lissamphibians related to whether the modern groups arose from only one group (dissorophoids) or from two different groups (dissorophoids and stereospondyls). The majority of studies place a group of temnospondyls called amphibamiforms as the closest relatives of modern amphibians. Similarities in teeth, skulls and hearing structures link the two groups. Whether temnospondyls are considered part of the tetrapod crown or stem thus depends on their inferred relationship to lissamphibians.\n\n\n== Definitions ==\n\n\n=== Branch-based definition ===\nIn 2000, Adam Yates and Anne Warren defined the name Temnospondyli as applying to the clade encompassing all organisms that are more closely related to Eryops than to the “microsaur” Pantylus. By this definition, if lissamphibians are temnospondyls and Pantylus is a reptiliomorph, the name Temnospondyli is synonymous with Batrachomorpha (a clade containing all organisms that are more closely related to modern amphibians than to mammals and reptiles).\n\n\n=== Node-based definition ===\nRainer Schoch in 2013 defined the name Temnospondyli as applying to “[t]he least inclusive clade containing Edops craigi and Mastodonsaurus giganteus”.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nMany temnospondyls are much larger than living amphibians, and superficially resemble crocodiles, which has led many taxa to be named with the suffix -suchus. The largest taxa, which were predominantly the Mesozoic stereospondyls, had skulls exceeding one meter in length, and the entire animal would have been several meters in length (for reference, the largest living amphibian, Andrias, is about 1.8 meters in body length).\nTiktaalik (; Inuktitut ᑎᒃᑖᓕᒃ [tiktaːlik]) is a monospecific genus of extinct sarcopterygian (lobe-finned fish) from the Late Devonian Period, about 375 Mya (million years ago), having many features akin to those of tetrapods (four-legged animals). Tiktaalik is estimated to have had a total length of 1.25–2.75 metres (4.1–9.0 ft) based on various specimens.\nUnearthed in Arctic Canada, Tiktaalik is a non-tetrapod member of Osteichthyes (bony fish), complete with scales and gills—but it has a triangular, flattened head and unusual, cleaver-shaped fins. Its fins have thin ray bones for paddling like most fish, but they also have sturdy interior bones that would have allowed Tiktaalik to prop itself up in shallow water and use its limbs for support as most four-legged animals do. Those fins and other mixed characteristics mark Tiktaalik as a crucial transition fossil, a link in evolution from swimming fish to four-legged vertebrates. This and similar animals might be the common ancestors of all vertebrate terrestrial fauna: amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals.\nThe first Tiktaalik fossils were found in 2004 on Ellesmere Island in Nunavut, Canada. The discovery, made by Edward B. Daeschler of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Neil H. Shubin from the University of Chicago, and Harvard University Professor Farish A. Jenkins Jr., was published in the April 6, 2006 issue of Nature and quickly recognized as a transitional form.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\n\nIn 2004, three fossilized Tiktaalik skeletons were discovered in the Late Devonian fluvial Fram Formation on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, in northern Canada. Estimated ages were reported at 375 Ma, 379 Ma and 383 Ma. At the time of the species' existence, Ellesmere Island was part of the continent Laurentia (modern eastern North America and Greenland), which was centered on the equator and had a warm climate. When discovered, one of the skulls was found sticking out of a cliff. Upon further inspection, the fossil was found to be in excellent condition for a 375-million-year-old specimen.\nThe discovery by Daeschler, Shubin and Jenkins was published in the April 6, 2006 issue of Nature and quickly recognized as a transitional form. Jennifer A. Clack, a Cambridge University expert on tetrapod evolution, said of Tiktaalik, \"It's one of those things you can point to and say, 'I told you this would exist,' and there it is.\" \n\n \nAfter five years of digging on Ellesmere Island, in the far north of Nunavut, they hit pay dirt: a collection of several fish so beautifully preserved that their skeletons were still intact. As Shubin's team studied the species they saw to their excitement that it was exactly the missing intermediate they were looking for. 'We found something that really split the difference right down the middle,' says Daeschler.\nTiktaalik is an Inuktitut word meaning \"large freshwater fish\". The \"fishapod\" genus received this name after a suggestion by Inuit elders of Canada's Nunavut Territory, where the fossil was discovered. The specific name roseae honours an anonymous donor. Taking a detailed look at the internal head skeleton of Tiktaalik roseae, in the October 16, 2008, issue of Nature, researchers show how Tiktaalik was gaining structures that could allow it to support itself on solid ground and breathe air, a key intermediate step in the transformation of the skull that accompanied the shift to life on land by our distant ancestors. More than 60 specimens of Tiktaalik have been discovered, though the holotype remains the most complete and well-described fossil.\n\n\n== Description ==\nTiktaalik provides insights on the features of the extinct closest relatives of the tetrapods. Tiktaalik was a large fish: the largest known fossils have an estimated length of 2.75 m (9.02 feet), with the longest lower jaws reaching a length of 31 centimetres (1.0 ft).\n\n\n=== Skull and neck ===\n The skull of Tiktaalik was low and flat, more similar in shape to that of a crocodile than most fish. The rear ed\nTetrapodomorpha (also known as Choanata) is a clade of vertebrates consisting of tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) and their closest sarcopterygian relatives that are more closely related to living tetrapods than to living lungfish. Advanced forms transitional between fish and the early labyrinthodonts, such as Tiktaalik, have been referred to as \"fishapods\" by their discoverers, being half-fish, half-tetrapods, in appearance and limb morphology. The Tetrapodomorpha contains the crown group tetrapods (the last common ancestor of living tetrapods and all of its descendants) and several groups of early stem tetrapods, which includes several groups of related lobe-finned fishes, collectively known as the osteolepiforms. The Tetrapodomorpha minus the crown group Tetrapoda are the stem Tetrapoda, a paraphyletic unit encompassing the fish to tetrapod transition.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nAmong the characteristics defining tetrapodomorphs are modifications to the fins, notably a humerus with convex head articulating with the glenoid fossa (the socket of the shoulder joint). Another key trait is the internal nostril or choana. Most fish have two pairs of nostrils, one on either side of the head for incoming water (incurrent nostrils) and another pair for outgoing water (excurrent nostrils). In early tetrapodomorphs like Kenichthys, the excurrent nostrils had shifted towards the mouth's perimeter. In later tetrapodomorphs, including tetrapods, the excurrent nostril is positioned inside the mouth, where it is known as the choana. The nearly-equivalent clade Choanata often refers to these later forms specifically.\n\n\n== History ==\nTetrapodomorph fossils are known from the early Devonian onwards, and include Osteolepis, Panderichthys, Kenichthys and Tungsenia. Tetrapodomorpha evolved from ancient lobe-finned fish (sarcopterygians) around 390 million years ago in the Middle Devonian period.\n\n\n== Classification ==\n\n\n=== Taxonomy ===\nAfter Benton, 2004; and Swartz, 2012.\n\nSubclass Sarcopterygii\nInfraclass Tetrapodomorpha\nOrder †Rhizodontida\nFamily †Sauripteridae\nFamily †Rhizodontidae\nSuperorder †Osteolepidida (or Osteolepiformes)\nFamily †Canowindridae\nFamily †Thysanolepidae\nFamily †Tristichopteridae\nOrder †Osteolepiformes (or Megalichthyiformes)\nFamily †Osteolepidae\nFamily †Megalichthyidae\nClade Eotetrapodiformes\nClade Elpistostegalia (or Panderichthyida)\nClade Stegocephalia\nFamily †Elpistostegidae\nFamily †Whatcheeriidae\nFamily †Colosteidae\nSuperfamily †Baphetoidea\nSuperclass Tetrapoda\nOther clades include the Eotetrapodiformes (Tinirau, Platycephalichthys, the Tristichopteridae and Elpistostegalia).

It belonged to Rhizodontida, one of the earliest-diverging tetrapodomorph clades. Two valid species have been described, both of which lived during the Early Carboniferous epoch. The type species R. hibberti is known from the Viséan stage of the United Kingdom, whereas the species R. serpukhovensis is from the Serpukhovian of Russia. Some fossils referred to the genus Rhizodus have also been found in North America.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe most notable characteristics of Rhizodus, compared to other giant rhizodonts such as Barameda, were the two 22-centimetre (8.7 in) fangs located near the front of its jaws, followed by other teeth scaling downwards in size. Rhizodus was a giant apex predator that resided in freshwater lakes, river systems and large swamps, with R. hibberti measuring 5.14–5.63 metres (16.9–18.5 ft) long and weighing 1–1.5 metric tons (1.1–1.7 short tons). It fed on small to medium-sized amphibians, using its teeth to kill prey and rip it into digestible sizes, rather than swallowing prey whole like other, smaller-toothed sarcopterygians.\nFossil skin imprints show that Rhizodus had large, plate-like scales, similar to those found on modern day arapaima.\n\n\n== Diet ==\nThe diet of Rhizodus' included medium-sized fish and tetrapods. It has been proposed that Rhizodus lunged at terrestrial, shorebound prey, just like a modern-day crocodile.\n\n\n== References ==\nHarajicadectes (IPA: [ˌhɑːɾɑːdʒɪkɑːˈdektes]) (meaning \"Harajica biter\") is a genus of stem-tetrapod from the Givetian to Frasnian Amadeus Basin in Northern Territory, Australia. The type and only species is Harajicadectes zhumini, known from 13 specimens of various preservation quality.\n\n\n== Description ==\nChoo et al., (2024) assigned a holotype and paratype to Harajicadectes, NTM P6410, and CPC 39948 respectively. The holotype consists of a partial skull and much of the body outline in dorsal view with squamation preserved. The paratype consists of a partial skull, right post-temporal and right lower jaw.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe generic name, Harajicadectes (IPA: [ˌhɑːɾɑːdʒɪkɑːˈdektes]), is derived from the member the specimens were found in, the Harajica Sandstone Member, and the Greek 'dēktēs', which translates to 'biter'. The specific name, zhumini (IPA: [ˌzjuˈmɪnaɪ]), honours Prof. Min Zhu of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Beijing; China, for his numerous contributions to early vertebrate paleontology.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nChoo et al., (2024) recovered Harajicadectes as a stem-tetrapod. They reconstructed two trees collated from 336 most parsimonious trees. The first tree is a strict consensus tree, the numbers represent Bremer support values. The second tree is a 50% majority-rule consensus tree, the numbers are node support bootstrap values.

The list includes all commonly accepted genera, but also genera that are now considered invalid, doubtful (nomina dubia), or were not formally published (nomina nuda), as well as junior synonyms of more established names, and genera that are no longer considered amphibians. Modern forms are excluded from this list. The list currently includes 457 names.\n\n\n== Naming conventions and terminology ==\nNaming conventions and terminology follow the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Technical terms used include:\n\nJunior synonym: A name which describes the same taxon as a previously published name. If two or more genera are formally designated and the type specimens are later assigned to the same genus, the first to be published (in chronological order) is the senior synonym, and all other instances are junior synonyms. Senior synonyms are generally used, except by special decision of the ICZN, but junior synonyms cannot be used again, even if deprecated. Junior synonymy is often subjective, unless the genera described were both based on the same type specimen.\nNomen nudum (Latin for \"naked name\"): A name that has appeared in print but has not yet been formally published by the standards of the ICZN. Nomina nuda (the plural form) are invalid, and are therefore not italicized as a proper generic name would be. If the name is later formally published, that name is no longer a nomen nudum and will be italicized on this list. Often, the formally published name will differ from any nomina nuda that describe the same specimen.\nNomen oblitum (Latin for \"forgotten name\"): A name that has not been used in the scientific community for more than fifty years after its original proposal.\nPreoccupied name: A name that is formally published, but which has already been used for another taxon. This second use is invalid (as are all subsequent uses) and the name must be replaced. As preoccupied names are not valid generic names, they will also go unitalicized on this list.\nNomen dubium (Latin for \"dubious name\"): A name describing a fossil with no unique diagnostic features. As this can be an extremely subjective and controversial designation, this term is not used on this list.\n\n\n== A ==\n\n\n== B ==\n\n\n== C ==\n\n\n== D ==\n\n\n== E ==\n\nEcolsonia\nElfridia\nElginerpeton\nEmbolomeri\nEnneabatrachus\nEocaecilia\nEocyclotosaurus\nEodiscoglossus\nEogyrinus\nEopelobates\nEorhinophrynus\nEoscapherpeton\nEoscopus\nEoxenopoides\nErpetocephalus\nErpetosaurus\nEryops\nEryosuchus\nErythrobatrachus\nEstesina\nEugyrinus\nEupelor\nEuryodus\nEryosuchus\n\n\n== F ==\nFayella\nFedexia\nFerganobatrachus\n\n\n== G ==\n\nGaudrya\nGeorgenthalia\nGephyrostegus\nGerrothorax\nGerobatrachus\nGobiates\nGobiatoides\nGobiops\nGonioglyptus\nGosgriffius\nGreererpeton\n\n\n== H ==\nHabrosaurus\nHadrokkosaurus\nHapsidopareion\nHatzegobatrachus\nHemprichisaurus\nHeptasaurus\nHorezmia\nHylaeobatrachus\nHyperkynodon\nHynerpeton\n\n\n== I ==\nIcanosaurus\nIchthyostega\nIndobenthosuchus\nIndobrachyops\nIndolyrocephalus\nInflectosaurus\nInflectosuchus\nIntasuchus\nIratusaurus\nIridotriton\nIsodectes\nItemirella\n\n\n== J ==\nJammerbergia\nJakubsonia\nJeholotriton\n\n\n== K ==\n\nKamacops\nKaraurus\nKeraterpeton\nKeratobrachyops\nKestrosaurus\nKizylkuma\nKoalliella\nKokartus\nKomatosuchus\nKonzukovia\nKoolasuchus\nKoskinonodon\nKourerpeton\nKryostega\nKuttycephalus\n\n\n== L ==\n\nLabyrinthodontia\nLaccocephalus\nLaccosaurus\nLaccotriton\nLafonius\nLaidleria\nLapillopsis\nLatiscopus\nLatonia\nLeiocephalikon\nLepterpeton\nLethiscus\nLiaobatrachus\nLiaoxitriton\nLimnerpeton\nLimnoiketes\nLimnogyrinus\nLisserpeton\nLithobatrachus\nLlankibatrachus\nLlistrofus\nLongiscitula\nLoxomma\nLuzocephalus\nLydekkerina\nLyrocephaliscus\nLysorophus\n\n\n== M ==\n\n\n== N ==\nNannaroter\nNannospongylus\nNanolania\nNeldasaurus\nNeusibatrachus\nNevobatrachus\nNezpercius\nNigerpeton\nNotobatrachus\nNotobrachiops\n\n\n== O ==\n\nOdenwaldia\nOdonterpeton\n\nLepospondyli is a diverse taxon of early tetrapods. With the exception of one late-surviving lepospondyl from the Late Permian of Morocco (Diplocaulus minimus), lepospondyls lived from the Visean stage of the Early Carboniferous to the Early Permian and were geographically restricted to what is now Europe and North America. Five major groups of lepospondyls are known: Adelospondyli; Aïstopoda; Lysorophia; Microsauria; and Nectridea. Lepospondyls have a diverse range of body forms and include species with newt-like, eel- or snake-like, and lizard-like forms. Various species were aquatic, semiaquatic, or terrestrial. None were large (the biggest genus, the diplocaulid Diplocaulus, reached a meter in length, but most were much smaller), and they are assumed to have lived in specialized ecological niches not taken by the more numerous temnospondyl amphibians that coexisted with them in the Paleozoic. \nLepospondyli was named in 1888 by Karl Alfred von Zittel, who coined the name to include some tetrapods from the Paleozoic that shared some specific characteristics in the notochord and teeth. Lepospondyls have sometimes been considered to be either related or ancestral to modern amphibians or to Amniota (the clade containing reptiles and mammals). It has been suggested that the grouping is polyphyletic, with aïstopods being primitive stem-tetrapods, while recumbirostran microsaurs are primitive reptiles.\n\n\n== Description ==\nAll lepospondyls are characterised by having simple, spool-shaped vertebrae that did not ossify from cartilage, but rather grew as bony cylinders around the notochord. In addition, the upper portion of the vertebra, the neural arch, is usually fused to the centrum (the main body of the vertebra).\n\n\n== Classification ==\nThe position of the Lepospondyli within the Tetrapoda is uncertain because the earliest lepospondyls were already highly specialized when they first appeared in the fossil record. Some lepospondyls were once thought to be related or perhaps ancestral to modern salamanders (Urodela), but not the other modern amphibians. This view is no longer held and all modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians) are now grouped within the clade Lissamphibia. For a long time, the Lepospondyli were considered one of the three subclasses of Amphibia, along with the Lissamphibia and the Labyrinthodontia. However, the dissolution of \"labyrinthodonts\" into separate groups such as temnospondyls and anthracosaurs has cast doubt on these traditional amphibian subclasses.  Much like \"Labyrinthodontia\", some studies proposed that Lepospondyli is an artificial (polyphyletic) grouping with some members closely related to extinct stem tetrapod groups and others more closely related to modern amphibians or reptiles. Early phylogenetic analyses conducted in the 1980s and 1990s often maintained the idea that lepospondyls were paraphyletic, with nectrideans close to colosteids and microsaurs close to temnospondyls, which were considered to be ancestral to modern amphibians.\nHowever, a 1995 paper by Robert Carroll argued that lepospondyls were actually a monophyletic group closer to reptiles. Carroll considered them closer to reptiles than the seymouriamorphs, but not as close as the diadectomorphs. Many phylogenetic analyses since Carroll (1995) agreed with his interpretation, including Laurin & Reisz (1997),  Anderson (2001), and Ruta et al. (2003). A few have still considered lepospondyls ancestral to amphibians, but came to this conclusion without changing the position of lepospondyls compared to seymouriamorphs and diadectomorphs.\nLepospondyl and tetrapod classification is still controversial, and even recent studies have had doubts about lepospondyl monophyly. For example, a 2007 paper has suggested that adelospondyls are stem-tetrapods close to colosteids and a 2017 paper on Lethiscus has  Aïstopoda in the tetrapod stem based on their primitive braincase. These studies differ in the internal and external relations\nEusthenopteron (from Greek: εὖ eû, 'good', Greek: σθένος sthénos, 'strength', and Greek: πτερόν pteron 'wing' or 'fin') is a genus of prehistoric sarcopterygian (often called \"lobe-finned\") fish known from several species that lived during the Late Devonian period, about 385 million years ago. It has attained an iconic status from its close relationship to tetrapods. Early depictions of animals of this genus show them emerging onto land, but paleontologists now think that eusthenopteron species were strictly aquatic animals, though this is not completely known.\nThe genus was first described by J. F. Whiteaves in 1881, as part of a large collection of fishes from Miguasha, Quebec, Canada. Some 2,000 Eusthenopteron specimens have been collected from Miguasha, one of which was the object of intensely detailed study and several papers by paleoichthyologist Erik Jarvik between the 1940s and the 1990s.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nEusthenopteron is a medium- to large-sized tristichopterid.  The species E. foordi is estimated to have exceeded 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) in length, while the species E. jenkinsi probably reached 2.1 m (6 ft 11 in). Eusthenopteron may have weighed around 50 kilograms.\nThe earliest known fossilized evidence of bone marrow has been found in Eusthenopteron, which may be the origin of bone marrow in tetrapods.Eusthenopteron shares many unique features among fishes but in common with the earliest-known tetrapods. It shares a similar pattern of skull roofing bones with stem tetrapoda forms such as Ichthyostega and Acanthostega. Eusthenopteron, like other tetrapodomorph fishes, had internal nostrils (or a choana), one of the defining traits of tetrapodomorphs, including tetrapods. It also had labyrinthodont teeth, characterized by infolded enamel, which characterizes all of the earliest known tetrapods as well.\nUnlike the early tetrapods, Eusthenopteron did not have larval gills.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nLike other fish-like sarcopterygians, Eusthenopteron possessed a two-part cranium, which hinged at mid-length along an intracranial joint. Eusthenopteron's notoriety comes from the pattern of its fin endoskeleton, which bears a distinct humerus, ulna, and radius in the fore-fin and femur, tibia, and fibula in the pelvic fin. These appendicular long bones had epiphyseal growth plates that allowed substantial longitudinal growth through endochondral ossification, as in tetrapod long bones. These six appendicular bones also occur in tetrapods and are a synapomorphy of a large clade of sarcopterygians, possibly Tetrapodomorpha (the humerus and femur are present in all sarcopterygians). Similarly, its elasmoid scales lack superficial odontodes composed of dentine and enamel; this loss appears to be a synapomorphy with more crownward tetrapodomorphs.\nEusthenopteron differs significantly from some later Carboniferous tetrapods in the apparent absence of a recognized larval stage and a definitive metamorphosis. In even the smallest known specimen of Eusthenopteron foordi, with a length of 29 millimetres (1.1 in), the lepidotrichia cover all of the fins, which does not happen until after metamorphosis in genera like Polydon (the American paddlefish). This might indicate that Eusthenopteron developed directly, with the hatchling already attaining the adult's general body form (Cote et al., 2002).\n\n\n== See also ==\nGogonasus\nTiktaalik – an even more tetrapod-like sarcopterygian\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nPalaeos.com – Vertebrates – Sarcopterygii (archive)\nBaphetidae is an extinct family of stem-tetrapods. Baphetids were large labyrinthodont predators of the Late Carboniferous period (Namurian through Westphalian) of Europe. Fragmentary remains from the Early Carboniferous of Canada have been tentatively assigned to the group. The phylogenetic relationships of baphetids is uncertain; while many studies have placed the group as a close relative of Amniota, other analyses have found Baphetidae to be a more basal clade of early stem tetrapods. Baphetids were among the first of the Carboniferous fossil tetrapods to be found and were originally described in 1850 by John William Dawson. The baphetids have been referred to the family Loxommatidae, but this group was later shown to be a junior synonym of Baphetidae, which was named earlier in 1865. Baphetids are known mainly from skulls; very little postcranial material has been found.\n\n\n== Palaeobiology ==\nThe presence of lateral lines and the long rows of needle-like teeth show that most were fish-eaters.  Their development was likely amphibian, though no larval fossils are known. Their best-known characteristic was a curious, keyhole-shaped orbit formed by excavation of the lacrimal and prefrontal bones in front of the eye.  It has been suggested that this space accommodated a salt gland or some kind of electrosensory organ.  Perhaps the better hypothesis is that the space allowed room for the contraction of an enlarged pterygoideus muscle.  In that case, this skull modification would represent an early form of skull fenestration for jaw muscles.\nThe skull is shallow.  Unlike the better-known embolomeres, the baphetid cheek and skull roof are sutured together.  There is a strongly embayed spiracular (\"otic\") notch, but the stapes is distally broad, which seems to rule out a sensitive hearing apparatus.  The palate is closed—a primitive character, but very different from the temnospondyls.  The coronoids bear no teeth or denticles, while the dentary has a double tooth row.\nSince the taxon is based almost exclusively on skulls, the body is very poorly known.  It is often said that the body was crocodile-like, but this appears to be largely supposition.  \n\nIt is not clear whether all of the genera assigned to this group are really closely related.  The traditional four genera of baphetids (Loxomma, Baphetes, Megalocephalus, and Spathicephalus) have recently been supplemented by Eucritta, a somewhat different form.  It has also been suggested that Crassigyrinus may be closely related.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nBaphetids were first described by Edward Drinker Cope when he erected the family Baphetidae in 1865 for Baphetes. Richard Lydekker named Loxomatinae in 1889 for Loxomma, which later became known as Loxommatidae. D. M. S. Watson described the group as Loxommidae in 1917. Later studies have shown Baphetes and Loxomma to be close relatives within the same family, and because Baphetidae was named before Loxommatidae, it has seniority and is the valid name of the group.\n\n\n=== Phylogeny ===\nBaphetids have been previously considered primitive temnospondyls and more recently batrachosaurs (reptile-like amphibia).   It is likely, however, that they represent one more of a number of early Carboniferous tetrapodomorph radiations.  Computer-assisted phylogenetic analyses of a data matrix using characteristics of most of the major groups of terrestrial vertebrates place the Baphetids close to the ancestry of amniotes.\nWith the reinterpretation of the Ichthyostegalia as aquatic forms, baphetids are good candidates for the spot of first labyrinthodont group to actually spend substantial time on land. If so, baphetids may be a rather important taxon.\n\n\n== References ==\nPanderichthys is a genus of extinct sarcopterygian (lobe-finned fish) from the late Devonian period, about 380 Mya. Panderichthys, which was recovered from Frasnian (early Late Devonian) deposits in Latvia, is represented by two species. P. stolbovi is known only from some snout fragments and an incomplete lower jaw. P. rhombolepis is known from several more complete specimens. Although it probably belongs to a sister group of the earliest tetrapods, Panderichthys exhibits a range of features transitional between tristichopterid lobe-fin fishes (e.g., Eusthenopteron) and early tetrapods. It is named after the German-Baltic paleontologist Christian Heinrich Pander. Possible tetrapod tracks dating back to before the appearance of Panderichthys in the fossil record were reported in 2010, which suggests that Panderichthys is not a direct ancestor of tetrapods, but nonetheless shows the traits that evolved during the fish-tetrapod evolution \n\n\n== Discovery and history ==\nPanderichthys is represented by two different species: Panderichthys rhombolepis and Panderichthys stobolvi. P. rhombolepis was discovered by Gross in 1930 and P. stobolvi was discovered and figured by Emilia Vorobyeva in 1960. P. rhombolepis was discovered in Lode, Latvia within Frasnian deposits and according to P.E. Ahlberg can definitely be found in other Frasnian deposits in Latvia. Although fossils of Panderichthys have been known for a long time, they have only recently been examined in full. The first time they were recognized as being phylogenetically closer to tetrapods than fish was by Shultze and Arsenault in 1985.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nPanderichthys is a 1.5–2 m (4 ft 11 in – 6 ft 7 in) long fish with a large tetrapod-like head that is flattened, narrow at the snout and wide in the back. The intracranial joint, which is characteristic of most lobe-fin fishes, has been lost from the external elements of the skull, but is still present in the braincase. The patterns of external bones in the skull roof and cheeks are more similar to those of early tetrapods than those of other lobe-fins. The transitional qualities of Panderichthys are also evident in the rest of the body. It lacks the dorsal and anal fins (fish fin) and its tail is more like those of early tetrapods than the caudal fins of other lobe-fins. The shoulders exhibit several tetrapod-like features, while the humerus is longer than those found in other lobe-fins. The vertebral column is ossified throughout its length and the vertebrae are comparable to those of early tetrapods. On the other hand, the distal parts of the front fins are unlike those of tetrapods. As would be expected from a fin, there are numerous lepidotrichia (long and thin fin rays).\nPanderichthys has many features that can be considered an intermediate form during the fish-tetrapod evolution and displays some features that are more derived than its phylogenetic position indicates, while others that are more basal. The body form of Panderichthys and Tiktaalik represents a major step in the transition from fish to tetrapods and they were even able to haul out on land. According to Shultze and Trueb, Panderichthys shares ten features with tetrapods:\n\nThe skull roof is flat compared to fish skulls.\nThe orbits are more dorsal and lie closer together.\nThe external naris is close to the margin of the upper jaw.\nFrontals are paired.\nThere is no external intracranial joint.\nThe parietal bone is located between the orbits and main portion posterior to orbits.\nIn  P. rhombolepis, the squamosal touches the maxilla (varies among specimens though).\nThe teeth have a complex polyplocodont structure.\nA lack of median fins.\nIn panderichthyids and Ichthyostega, the ribs are attached to the neural arch and there is an intercentrum.\n\n\n=== Humerus ===\nOne of the key transitional features of Panderichthys is its humerus. During the transition from fish to tetrapods the limbs began to move and became located at a right angle to the body rather than be\nGaiasia is an extinct genus of stem-tetrapods from the Early Permian of Namibia, containing a single species, Gaiasia jennyae. Gaiasia was a freshwater predator which was exceptional among stem-tetrapods for its combination of relatively enormous size, Southern occurrence, and late survival.\nGaiasia is known from three fossil specimens, including an incomplete skeleton with a crushed skull and partial vertebral column. Though limb material is not preserved, the skull of Gaiasia indicates that its affinities lie with digit-bearing stem-tetrapods (early amphibians, in the broad sense). It was a close relative to the colosteids, a family of aquatic stem-tetrapods with long bodies and small limbs. Most digit-bearing stem-tetrapods, including the colosteids, go extinct by the Carboniferous rainforest collapse near the end of the preceding Carboniferous Period. Gaiasia is one of the few to survive into the Permian alongside crown-tetrapods (the groups directly ancestral to living amphibians, mammals, and reptiles).\nGaiasia is the largest known digit-bearing stem-tetrapods, with an estimated maximum skull length reaching 60 centimetres (24 in). It was found in the Gai-As Formation, a rock unit corresponding to cold temperate lake environments located near the South Pole (around 55° South) in the Permian. Other digit-bearing stem tetrapods were significantly smaller (skulls under 40 centimetres (16 in) in length), and nearly all were restricted to the tropics of Euramerica, a low-latitude region equivalent to present-day Europe and North America. Gaiasia hints that stem-tetrapods in Southern latitudes continued to persist and evolve through the Late Paleozoic icehouse interval, even as low-latitude species died out and were supplanted by crown-tetrapods. Gaiasia's genus name references the Gai-As Formation, while the species name honors the late Jenny Clack, an expert in early tetrapods.\n\n\n== Description ==\nGaiasia has a broad flattened skull, large keeled branchial elements (throat or gill bones), a reinforced neck, and massive interlocking fangs at the front of the snout. Together these traits indicate that it was well-adapted for both suction feeding and a strong bite. The front edge of the snout is not fully preserved, but the profile of the skull shows that the snout is short and boxy. The bones of the skull roof are thin and ornamented by radiating ridges and grooves. A pineal foramen is absent, but lateral line canals are well-developed and a small intertemporal bone is present. Most unique features relate to the palate (roof of the mouth). The parasphenoid bone (which forms the floor of the braincase) is large and wide, with a blunt front tip, but the interpterygoid vacuities (large holes which flank the parasphenoid) are narrow. The paired bones at the front of the palate have large fangs: two fangs on each vomer, one per palatine, and one per ectopterygoid. Each fang is paired with a large pit which hosts developing replacement teeth.\nThe lower jaw is rather thin and smoothly curved at the front, but thickens further back and extends past the jaw joint. Several fangs occur at the front of the lower jaw, with three on each side (six in total). Two of the three fangs are adjacent to the symphysis (the point where the two sides of the jaw converge at the middle). These two fangs are hosted by the adsymphyseal and dentary bones. The largest fang is located a bit further back, on an enlarged first coronoid bone which swells inwards from the rim of the jaw. The neck joint is a strong hinge, formed from the contact between a pair of exoccipital condyles (rounded surfaces on the braincase) and a partially fused atlas-axis complex (the first few neck vertebrae). Paired exoccipital condyles have convergently evolved in a number of crown-tetrapod lineages (lissamphibians, stereospondyls, some \"lepospondyls\", and mammals), none of which are related to Gaiasia. On the edge of the braincase, a spur of bone divides the spiracular cleft (a \nEmbolomeri is an order of tetrapods or stem-tetrapods, possibly members of Reptiliomorpha. Embolomeres first evolved in the Early Carboniferous (Mississippian) Period and were the largest and most successful predatory tetrapods of the Late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) Period. They were specialized semiaquatic predators with long bodies for eel-like undulatory swimming. Embolomeres are characterized by their vertebral centra, which are formed by two cylindrical segments, the pleurocentrum at the rear and intercentrum at the front. These segments are equal in size. Most other tetrapods have pleurocentra and intercentra which are drastically different in size and shape.\nEmbolomeres were among the earliest large carnivorous tetrapods, with members such as the crocodilian-like Proterogyrinus appearing in the Visean stage of the Carboniferous. They declined in diversity during the Permian period, though at least one representative (Archeria) was common in the Early Permian. Embolomeres went extinct shortly before the end of the Permian.\n\n\n== Classification ==\n\nThe order Embolomeri was first named by Edward Drinker Cope in 1884 during his revision of \"batrachian\" (amphibian) evolution. Embolomeri was differentiated from several other newly named amphibian orders, such as \"Rachitomi\", by the presence of intercentra and pleurocentra of the same size and shape, that being large cylinders. At the time, embolomere fossils were uncommon, so Cope could only identify \"cricotids\" such as Cricotus as possessing embolomerous vertebrae. The genus name \"Cricotus\" is dubious, as it has been used by Cope to refer to embolomere fossils spanning anywhere between mid-Pennsylvanian deposits of Illinois and the Permian red beds of Texas. Most paleontologists now refer the red bed \"Cricotus\" specimens to the genus Archeria.\nMichel Laurin (1998) formally defined Embolomeri as \"the last common ancestor of Proterogyrinus and Archeria and all of its descendants.\" This definition excludes Eoherpeton, which is almost always considered a close ally of the group. Some authors place Silvanerpeton or chroniosuchians as close relatives as well, though they are generally agreed to lie outside Embolomeri proper.\nThe poorly-defined group Anthracosauria is sometimes considered synonymous with Embolomeri, and the group's namesake, Anthracosaurus, is an embolomere. However, other authors use the term \"Anthracosauria\" in reference to a broader group which includes embolomeres in combination with various other reptile-like amphibians (reptiliomorphs). Reptiliomorphs are all tetrapods more closely related to living reptiles and synapsids (mammals and their ancestors), rather than living amphibians. Despite this, reptiliomorphs likely had amphibian-like biological traits, such as water-based reproduction.\nMany studies conducted since the 1990s have also placed the group Lepospondyli as closer to amniotes than embolomeres were. Lepospondyls are a particularly unusual group of tetrapods, with some members (i.e. brachystelechids) very similar to lissamphibians and others (i.e. tuditanids) very similar to amniotes. If lepospondyls are both close relatives of amniotes and the ancestors of modern amphibians, then that means that crown-Tetrapoda (descendants of the common ancestor to all living tetrapods) is a much more restricted group than previously assumed. In this situation, various traditional orders of Tetrapoda such as Embolomeri and Temnospondyli actually would qualify as stem-tetrapods due to having evolved prior to the split between modern amphibians and amniotes.\nHowever, most authors consider temnospondyls to be the ancestors of modern amphibians. This would suggest that embolomeres are likely reptiliomorphs (closer to reptiles) and within the clade Tetrapoda. However, even this classification is not stable, as some analyses have found embolomeres to be more basal than temnospondyls.\nBelow is a cladogram from Ruta et al. (2003):\n\n\n== Genera ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\"Labyrinthodontia\" (Greek, 'maze-toothed') is an informal grouping of extinct predatory amphibians which were major components of ecosystems in the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras (about 390 to 150 million years ago). Traditionally considered a subclass of the class Amphibia, modern classification systems recognize that labyrinthodonts are not a formal natural group (clade) exclusive of other tetrapods. Instead, they consistute an evolutionary grade (a paraphyletic group), ancestral to living tetrapods such as lissamphibians (modern amphibians) and amniotes (reptiles, mammals, and kin). \"Labyrinthodont\"-grade vertebrates evolved from lobe-finned fishes in the Devonian, though a formal boundary between fish and amphibian is difficult to define at this point in time.\n\"Labyrinthodont\" generally refers to extinct four-limbed tetrapods with a large body size and a crocodile-like lifestyle. The name describes the pattern of infolding of the dentin and enamel of the teeth, which are often the only part of the creatures that fossilize. They are also distinguished by a broad, strongly-built skull roof composed of many small heavily-textured skull bones. \"Labyrinthodonts\" generally have complex multi-part vertebrae, and several classification schemes have utilized vertebrae to define subgroups.\nBecause labyrinthodonts do not form a monophyletic group, many modern researchers have abandoned the term. However, some have continued to use the group in their classifications, at least informally, pending more detailed study of their relationships. Many authors prefer to simply use the term tetrapod, while others have re-defined the previously obsolete term Stegocephalia (\"roof heads\") as a cladistic alternative to \"Labyrinthodontia\" or \"Tetrapoda\".\n\n\n== Labyrinthodont traits ==\n\nThe labyrinthodonts flourished for more than 200 million years. Particularly the early forms exhibited a lot of variation, yet there are still a few basic anatomical traits that make their fossils very distinct and easily recognizable in the field:\n\nStrongly folded tooth surface, involving infolding of the dentin and enamel of the teeth. The cross section resembles a classical labyrinth (or maze), hence the name of the group.\nMassive skull roof, with openings only for the nostrils, eyes and a parietal eye, similar to the structure of the \"anapsid\" reptiles. With the exception of the later more reptile-like forms, the skull was rather flat and strongly ornamented with presumably tough dermal covering, accounting for an older term for the group: \"Stegocephalia\".\nOtic notch behind each eye at the back edge of the skull. In earlier fully aquatic forms such as Ichthyostega, it may have formed an open spiracle. In later terrestrial forms such as Seymouria, it may possibly have held a tympanic membrane (eardrum).\nComplex vertebrae made of multiple components: an intercentrum (wedge-shaped front lower piece), two pleurocentra (upper rear piece), and a vertebral arch/spine (upper projection). The relative development and shape of the elements is highly variable.\n\n\n== The labyrinthodonts in life ==\n\n\n=== General build ===\nLabyrinthodonts were generally amphibian-like in build. They were short-legged and mostly large headed, with moderately short to long tails. Many groups, and all the early forms, were large animals. Primitive members of all labyrinthodont groups were probably true water predators, and various degrees of amphibious, semi-aquatic and semi terrestrial modes of living arose independently in different groups. Some lineages remained waterbound or became secondarily fully aquatic with reduced limbs and elongated, eel-like bodies.\n\n\n=== Skull ===\n\nWith the exception of the snake-like aïstopods, the skulls of labyrinthodonts were massive.  The broad head and short neck may have been a result of respiratory constraints. Their jaws were lined with small, sharp, conical teeth and the roof of the mouth bore larger tusk-like teeth. The teeth were replaced in waves th\nRhizodontida is an extinct group of predatory tetrapodomorphs known from many areas of the world from the Givetian through to the Pennsylvanian - the earliest known species is about 377 million years ago (Mya), the latest around 310 Mya. Rhizodonts lived in tropical rivers and freshwater lakes and were the dominant predators of their age. They reached huge sizes - the largest known species, Rhizodus hibberti from Europe and North America, was an estimated 7 m in length, making it the largest freshwater fish known.\n\n\n== Description ==\n \nThe upper jaw had a marginal row of small teeth on the maxilla and premaxilla, medium-sized fangs on the ectopterygoid and dermopalatine bones, and large tusks on the vomers and premaxillae. On the lower jaw were marginal teeth on the dentary, with fangs on the three coronoids and a huge tusk at the symphysial tip of the dentary. Apparently, the left and right mandibles rotated inwards towards each other on biting. This may have been a kinetic mechanism to dig the marginal teeth more deeply into the prey, to help grip slippery or struggling items.\nThe trunk was elongated, with pelvic, two dorsal and anal fins much reduced and placed posteriorly The anal and second dorsal fins formed a functional part of the tail. The lateral line system was elaborated on the skull and pectoral girdle - in Strepsodus the main trunk lateral line also had several subsidiary lines running parallel to it. This probably helped rhizodonts detect prey in the turbid, swampy environments where they lived.\nRhizodont pelvic fins are known only from external morphology. They are smaller than the pectoral fins and positioned toward the rear of the body. In comparison to the other fins, the pectoral fins were much enlarged. They had a well-developed internal skeleton surrounded by robust, largely unsegmented lepidotrichia; the whole fin was then covered in deeply overlapping scales. This turned the pectoral fin into a broad paddle.\n\n\n== Phylogeny ==\nThe cladogram presented below is based on a 2021 study by Clement and colleagues:\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nJudging from their anatomy, rhizodonts had an extremely powerful bite. They probably employed a 'grip and drag' hunting technique, where prey was ambushed, the tusks sunk in to secure it, and then depending on its size, either thrashed on the surface to subdue it, or dragged to where the rhizodont could consume it without being disturbed. Their prey probably included large sharks, lungfish, and other lobe-finned fishes, and even tetrapods, because all tetrapods at this time still had to lay their eggs in water.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nJohanson, Z. & Ahlberg, P.E.

The species epithet H. lindae is derived from the name of the wife of Keith Stewart Thomson, who described this fish.\n\n\n== Description ==\nHyneria was a large fish. H. lindae is estimated around 2.5–3 metres (8.2–9.8 ft) in total length. An isolated cleithrum AM 6545 likely belongs to an individual of at least 2.7 metres (8.9 ft) in length. The largest complete jaw reaches 38 centimetres (15 in), but there is much larger fragment possibly from a jaw about twice that length, although that specimen may belong to a rhizodont instead. Assuming this jaw fragment does pertain to Hyneria, and assuming proportions similar to more complete tristichopterids, it suggests H. lindae could possibly reach lengths up to 3.5 metres (11 ft). A second species, H. uldezinye, was once estimated as having a length of between 2 and 4 metres (6.6 and 13.1 ft) before being described. However, the species description estimates that the largest specimen belongs to an animal about 3 metres (9.8 ft). Its skull had heavy, ornamented dermal bones and its lower jaw was relatively long and shallow. The teeth were stout, with those of the premaxilla forming fangs upwards of 5 cm (2 in). Its body was covered by cycloid scales. It had large sensory canals to aid in detection of possible prey, as the freshwater environment it inhabited likely was murky and had low visibility. Adult individuals retained juvenile features (i.e. partially unossified skeletons), suggesting that they were likely neotenic.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\n\nThe original fossils came from two localities in Pennsylvania, United States, one found between the villages of North Bend and Hyner and another near Emporium. They consisted of a disarticulated partial skull and fragments of the shoulder girdle. The fossils were found in the Catskill Formation of the Red Hill Shale, dating to the upper Devonian. These were the only remains known until 1993 when a renewed collecting effort discovered abundant new material. Hyneria is considered the largest and most common lobe-finned fish found in the Red Hill Shale. In February 2023 a second species of Hyneria, H. udlezinye, was named from remains discovered in the Waterloo Farm lagerstätte. These remains include the skull and shoulder girdle.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHyneria Archived 2008-05-11 at the Wayback Machine at Devonian Times\nThe Zachelmie trackways are a series of Middle Devonian-age trace fossils in Poland, purportedly the oldest evidence of terrestrial vertebrates (tetrapods) in the fossil record. These trackways were discovered in the Wojciechowice Formation, an Eifelian-age carbonate unit exposed in the Zachełmie Quarry of the Świętokrzyskie Mountains (Holy Cross Mountains). The discovery of these tracks has complicated the study of tetrapod evolution. Morphological studies suggest that four-limbed vertebrates (\"tetrapods\" in the broad sense, also known as stegocephalians) are descended from a specialized type of tetrapodomorph fish, the epistostegalians. This hypothesis was supported further by the discovery and 2006 description of Tiktaalik, a well-preserved epistostegalian from the Frasnian of Nunavut. Crucial to this idea is the assumption that tetrapods originated in the Late Devonian, after elpistostegalians appear in the fossil record near the start of the Frasnian. The Zachelmie trackways, however, appear to demonstrate that tetrapods were present prior to the Late Devonian. The implications of this find has led to several different perspectives on the sequence of events involved in tetrapod evolution.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\n\nIn January 2010, a group of paleontologists published a paper which showed that the first tetrapods appeared long before any know fossils of Tiktaalik or other elpistostegids. This paper was accompanied by extensive supplementary material and also discussed in a Nature documentary on the origin of tetrapods.  Their conclusions were based on numerous trackways (esp. Muz. PGI 1728.II.16) and individual footprints (esp. Muz. PGI 1728.II.1) discovered at the Zachełmie quarry.\nA tetrapod origin of those tracks was suggested based on:\n\nDistinct digits and limb morphology;\nTrackways reflecting quadrupedal gait and diagonal walk;\nNo body or tail drag marks;\nVery wide stride in relation to body length (much beyond that of Tiktaalik or any other fish);\nVarious size footprints with some unusually big (up to 26 cm wide) indicating body lengths of over 2.5 m.\nTrack-bearing layers were assigned to the lower-middle Eifelian based on conodont index fossil samples (costatus Zone) and \"previous biostratigraphic data obtained from the underlying and overlying strata\" with subsequent studies confirming this dating. The Eifelian stage is the first stage of the Middle Devonian, more than 10 million years older than the Frasnian-age Tiktaalik. It is far older than any known tetrapod fossils, and even older than most fossils of tetrapodomorph fish.\nA reanalysis by Martin Qvarnström, Piotr Szrek, Per Ahlberg, and Grzegorz Niedźwiedzki, of the paleoenvironment of the Zachelmie trackways were reinterpreted as \"a succession of ephemeral lakes with a restricted and non-marine biota, rather than a marginal marine environment as originally thought\". This shows that the purported tetrapods associated with the trackways were likely capable of terrestrial locomotion.\n\n\n== Implications for tetrapod evolution ==\n\nTiktaalik's discoverers were skeptical about the Zachelmie trackways. Daeschler said that trace evidence was not enough for him to modify the theory of tetrapod evolution, while Shubin argued that Tiktaalik could have produced very similar footprints. In a later study Shubin expressed a significantly modified opinion that some of the Zachelmie footprints, those which lacked digits, may have been made by walking fish. However, Ahlberg insisted that those tracks could not have possibly been formed either by natural processes or by transitional species such as Tiktaalik or Panderichthys. Instead, the authors of the publication suggested that \"ichthyostegalian\"-grade tetrapods were the responsible trackmakers, based on available pes morphology of those animals. However, a paper published in 2015 that undertook a critical review of Devonian tetrapod footprints called into question the designation of the Zachelmie marks and instead suggested an origin\nCrassigyrinus (from Latin: crassus, 'thick' and Greek: γυρίνος Greek: gyrínos, 'tadpole') is an extinct genus of carnivorous stem tetrapod from the Early Carboniferous Limestone Coal Group of Scotland and possibly Greer, West Virginia. \n\n\n== Discovery ==\nThe type specimen was originally described as Macromerium scoticum and lacked a complete skull. With subsequent discoveries, Crassigyrinus is now known from three skulls, one of which is in articulation with a fairly complete skeleton, and two incomplete lower jaws. Crassigyrinus grew up to 2 meters in length, coupled with tiny limbs and unusually large jaws. Crassigyrinus is taxonomically enigmatic, having confused paleontologists for decades with its apparent fish-like and tetrapod features. It was traditionally placed within the group Labyrinthodontia along with many other early tetrapods. Some paleontologists have even considered it as the most basal crown group tetrapod, while others hesitate to even place it within the Tetrapoda superclass.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nCrassigyrinus had a streamlined body up to 2 meters in length. Its limbs were tiny and virtually useless, implying that the animal was almost completely aquatic. Crassigyrinus had unusually large jaws, equipped with two rows of sharp teeth, the second row having a pair of palatal fangs. Studies have shown that Crassigyrinus may have been able to open its mouth as wide as 60 degrees, which suggests that it was a powerful predator with a strong bite. This strongly suggests that it was ideally suited for catching fish, and the animal was probably a fast-moving predator.\n\nSeveral thickened bony ridges ran along the dorsal midline of the snout and between the eyes, and several paleontologists have suggested that they helped the skull to withstand stress when the animal bit prey. Crassigyrinus had large eyes, suggesting that it was either nocturnal, or lived in very murky water. It possessed large otic (spiracular) notches, probably accommodating a spiracle rather than a tympanic membrane.\nIts peculiar stunted forelimbs were tiny and the humerus was only 35 mm long (the whole animal was about 1.5 m long). Various foramina on the humeral surfaces are very similar to those seen in Ichthyostega, Acanthostega, and lobe-finned fishes like Eusthenopteron. The hindlimbs were much larger than the forelimbs, and in the pelvis the ilium lacked a bony connection to the vertebral column (a classic feature of aquatic tetrapods). Although there is evidence that the Crassigyrinus eventually lost its limbs, there is counterevidence in that it used its limbs for movement, as proven by healing in the bones in case of injury. The fact that there is a need to heal the limbs must mean there was an importance of the limbs at some point, and was then lost. The tail, only known from a few vertebrae fragments, is assumed to have been long and laterally compressed.\nA crushed skull from the Dora bonebed near Cowdenbeath was described by Panchen (1985). The skull was redescribed by Porro et al. (2023), based on a digital reconstruction derived from CT scans. The 1985 reconstruction of the skull was much taller and narrower than in most early tetrapods, though the 2023 reconstruction is relatively low and broad.\n\n\n== Paleobiology ==\nCrassygyrinus was an aquatic predator. It was capable of opening its jaws widely at a 60-degree angle, with a powerful bite with rapid jaw closure, allowing it to grasp and consume relatively large prey items.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCrassigyrinus\nReptiliomorpha (meaning reptile-shaped; in PhyloCode known as Pan-Amniota) is a clade containing the amniotes and those tetrapods that share a more recent common ancestor with amniotes than with living amphibians (lissamphibians). It was defined by Michel Laurin (2001) and Vallin and Laurin (2004) as the largest clade that includes Homo sapiens, but not Ascaphus truei (tailed frog). Laurin and Reisz (2020) defined Pan-Amniota as the largest total clade containing Homo sapiens, but not Pipa pipa, Caecilia tentaculata, and Siren lacertina.\nThe informal variant of the name, \"reptiliomorphs\", is also occasionally used to refer to stem-amniotes, i.e. a grade of reptile-like tetrapods that are more closely related to amniotes than they are to lissamphibians, but are not amniotes themselves; the name is used in this meaning e.g. by Ruta, Coates and Quicke (2003). An alternative name, \"Anthracosauria\", is also commonly used for the group, but is confusingly also used for a more primitive grade of reptiliomorphs (Embolomeri) by Benton. While both anthracosaurs and/or embolomeres are suggested to be reptiliomorphs closer to amniotes, some recent studies either retain them as amphibians or argue that their relationships are still ambiguous and are more likely to be stem-tetrapods.\nAs the exact phylogenetic position of Lissamphibia within Tetrapoda remains uncertain, it also remains controversial which fossil tetrapods are more closely related to amniotes than to lissamphibians, and thus, which ones of them were reptiliomorphs in any meaning of the word. The two major hypotheses for lissamphibian origins are that they are either descendants of dissorophoid temnospondyls or microsaurian \"lepospondyls\". If the former (the \"temnospondyl hypothesis\") is true, then Reptiliomorpha includes all tetrapod groups that are closer to amniotes than to temnospondyls. These include the diadectomorphs, seymouriamorphs, most or all \"lepospondyls\", gephyrostegids, and possibly the embolomeres and chroniosuchians. In addition, several \"anthracosaur\" genera of uncertain taxonomic placement would also probably qualify as reptiliomorphs, including Solenodonsaurus, Eldeceeon, Silvanerpeton, and Casineria. However, if lissamphibians originated among the lepospondyls according to the \"lepospondyl hypothesis\", then Reptiliomorpha refers to groups that are closer to amniotes than to lepospondyls. Few non-amniote groups would count as reptiliomorphs under this definition, although the diadectomorphs are among those that qualify.\n\n\n== Changing definitions ==\nThe name Reptiliomorpha was coined by Professor Gunnar Säve-Söderbergh in 1934 to designate amniotes and various types of late Paleozoic tetrapods that were more closely related to amniotes than to living amphibians. In his view, the amphibians had evolved from fish twice, with one group composed of the ancestors of modern salamanders and the other, which Säve-Söderbergh referred to as Eutetrapoda, consisting of anurans (frogs), amniotes, and their ancestors, with the origin of caecilians being uncertain. Säve-Söderbergh's Eutetrapoda consisted of two sister-groups: Batrachomorpha, containing anurans and their ancestors, and Reptiliomorpha, containing anthracosaurs and amniotes. Säve-Söderbergh subsequently added Seymouriamorpha to his Reptiliomorpha as well.\nAlfred Sherwood Romer rejected Säve-Söderbergh's theory of a biphyletic amphibia and used the name Anthracosauria to describe the \"labyrinthodont\" lineage from which amniotes evolved. In 1970, the German paleontologist Alec Panchen took up Säve-Söderbergh's name for this group as having priority, but Romer's terminology is still in use, e.g. by Carroll (1988 and 2002) and by Hildebrand & Goslow (2001). Some writers preferring phylogenetic nomenclature use Anthracosauria.\nIn 1956, Friedrich von Huene included both amphibians and anapsid reptiles in the Reptiliomorpha. This included the following orders: Anthracosauria, Seymouriamorpha, Microsauria, Diadectomo\nThe Batrachomorpha (\"frog forms\") are a clade containing extant and extinct amphibians that are more closely related to modern amphibians than they are to mammals and reptiles (including birds). According to many analyses they include the extinct Temnospondyli; some show that they include the Lepospondyli instead. The name traditionally indicated a more limited group.\nThe first tetrapods were all amphibians in the physiological sense that they laid their eggs in water, and are colloquially sometimes referred to as labyrinthodonts or stegocephalians. The term \"amphibians\" can be ambiguous, however. In modern phylogeny, the basalmost tetrapods are discerned from two derived branches, one consisting of the crown group of modern amphibians, the Lissamphibia, and its relatives. In this scheme, the name Batrachomorpha is given to this branch of amphibians, while the name Reptiliomorpha denotes the other branch. While the actual phylogeny of the modern amphibians is not well understood, their ancestors are descended from one line of batrachomorphs. All other living tetrapods (reptiles, birds and mammals) are descended from one branch of reptiliomorphs, the amniotes. Amniotes achieved dominance, while all other reptiliomorphs and most batrachomorphs have gone extinct.\n\n\n== Classification ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe name Batrachomorpha was coined by the Swedish palaeontologist Gunnar Säve-Söderbergh in 1934 to refer to ichthyostegids, temnospondyls, anthracosaurs, and the frogs. Säve-Söderbergh held the view that salamanders and caecilians are not related to the other tetrapods, but had developed independently from a different group of lobe-finned fish, the porolepiformes. In this view amphibians would be a biphyletic group, and Batrachomorpha was erected to form a natural group consisting of the \"true amphibians\" (i.e. frogs in Säve-Söderberghs view) and their fossil relatives. The salamanders and the Lepospondyli was consigned to \"Urodelomorpha\".\nFriedrich von Huene adopted it as a superorder of his subclass \"Eutetrapoda\" (the lower tetrapods exclusive of the urodeles) and included the orders Stegocephalia (here including a number of Labyrinthodonts) and Anura. Erik Jarvik, who took over Säve-Söderberghs work and shared his view of the origin of salamanders, used the term more informally, but in a wider sense, to include the ancestral osteolepiform fishes.\nThough never a majority view, the notion that tetrapods had evolved twice, together with the usage of the term batrachomorpha, lingered until genetic analysis started confirming the monophyly of living amphibians in the 1990s. Jarviks classification is no longer followed, all living amphibians and their fossil relatives now being classified together in the group Lissamphibia.\n\n\n=== Phylogenetics ===\n\nMichael Benton adopted the term Batrachomorpha to include all living amphibians and extinct relatives more closely related to amphibians than to amniotes. In his scheme, Batrachomorpha is a superorder of amphibious tetrapods containing the following subgroups:\n\nSuperorder Batrachomorpha\n†Order Edopoidea\n†Family Dendrerpetonidae\nOrder unnamed\n†Suborder Dvinosauria\n†Family Branchiosauridae\n†Family Dissorophidae\nInfraclass Lissamphibia\n†Family Albanerpetonidae\nOrder Gymnophiona (extant )\nOrder Urodela (extant )\nOrder Anura (extant )\n†Order unnamed\n†Family †Eryopidae\n†Family Actinodontidae\n†Family Archegosauridae\n†Family Rhinesuchidae\n†Suborder Capitosauria\n†Suborder Trematosauria\n†Family Trematosauridae\n†Family Metoposauridae\n†Family Plagiosauridae\n†Family Rhytidosteidae\n†Family Brachyopidae\n†Family Chigutisauridae\nThe other groups of tetrapods considered more closely related to amniotes are put in the superorder Reptiliomorpha.\nThe phylogenetic relationships of Paleozoic tetrapods have not yet been worked out with certainty, and the validity of Batrachomorpha as a clade depends on where other amphibians and early amniotes fit on the evolutionary tree. The actual content of Batrachomorpha \nPederpes (\"Peter's Foot\") is an extinct genus of early Carboniferous tetrapod, dating from 348 to 347.6 Ma in the Tournaisian age (lower Mississippian). Pederpes contains one species, P. finneyae, 1 m long.\nThis most basal Carboniferous tetrapod had a large, somewhat triangular head, similar to that of later American sister-genus Whatcheeria, from which it is distinguished by various skeletal features, such as a spike-like latissimus dorsi (an arm muscle) attachment on the humerus and several minor skull features. The feet had characteristics that distinguished it from the paddle-like feet of the Devonian Ichthyostegalia and resembled the feet of later, more terrestrially adapted Carboniferous forms. Pederpes is the earliest-known tetrapod to show the beginnings of terrestrial locomotion and despite the probable presence of a sixth digit on the forelimbs it was at least functionally pentadactyl.\n\n\n== Discovery and classification ==\n\nPederpes was discovered in 1971 in central Scotland and classified as a lobe-finned fish. Its fossils were found in the Ballagan Formation. The type specimen was a nearly complete, articulated skeleton. Only the tail and some bones of the skull and limbs were missing. It was not until 2002 that Jennifer Clack named and reclassified the fossil as a primitive tetrapod.\nPederpes is placed in the family Whatcheeriidae, of uncertain relationships to other tetrapod families. While an amphibian in the broad sense, under cladistic taxonomy, Pederpes is not a member of the crown group amphibian in the meaning of modern amphibians. As a very basal (primitive) tetrapod, it falls under the traditional class Amphibia in Linnaean taxonomy.\nPederpes is an important fossil because it comes from the period known as Romer's gap and provides biologists with rare information about the development of tetrapods in a time when terrestrial life was rare.\nThe fossil was discovered in the Ballagan Formation, Inverclyde Group, claviger-macra (CM) palynozone (348 to 347.6 mya), Tournaisain Tn3c, Courceyan, Dinantian, Lower Carboniferous.\n\n\n== Anatomy and lifestyle ==\n\nPederpes was 1 m long, making it average-sized for an early tetrapod.\nThe shape of the skull and the fact that the feet face forward rather than outward indicate that Pederpes was well adapted to land life. It is currently the earliest known fully terrestrial animal, although the structure of the ear shows that its hearing was still much more functional underwater than on land, and may have spent much of its time in the water and could have hunted there.\nThe narrow skull suggests that Pederpes breathed by inhaling with a muscular action like most modern tetrapods, rather than by pumping air into the lungs with a throat pouch the way many modern amphibians do.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTaxonomicon entry for Pederpes\nTaxonomicon entry for P. finneyae\nAbstract of description\nNational Geographic News article on 2002 identification of Pederpes fossil\nDixon, Dougal.The World Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Creatures. Anness Publishing Ltd. London, UK: 2007.\nAistopoda (Greek for \"[having] not-visible feet\") is an order of highly specialised snake-like stegocephalians known from the Carboniferous and Early Permian of Europe and North America, ranging from tiny forms only 5 centimetres (2 in), to nearly 1 metre (3.3 ft) in length.  They first appear in the fossil record in the Mississippian period and continue through to the Early Permian.\nThe skull is small but very specialised, with large orbits, and large fenestrae. The primitive form Ophiderpeton has a pattern of dermal bones in the skull similar in respects to the temnospondyls. But in the advanced genus Phlegethontia the skull is very light and open, reduced to a series of struts supporting the braincase against the lower jaw, just as in snakes, and it is possible that the aistopods filled the same ecological niches in the Paleozoic that snakes do today.\n\nThey had an extremely elongated body, with up to 230 vertebrae. The vertebrae were holospondylous, having only a single ossification per segment.  They lacked intercentra, even in the tail, and had are no free haemal arches.  The neural arch was low and fused to the centrum. All of these features are very similar to those of the Nectridea, both representing the typical lepospondylous condition.\nA recent paper described the internal organization of the aistopod head, finding that aïstopods retained many fish-like features of the skull and brain, including a persistent extension of the notochord into the head and an open canal between the pituitary gland and the mouth. Because these features are lost early in tetrapod evolution, this may be evidence that aistopods diverged from other tetrapods soon after the origin of digits.\nThe ribs were slender, either single or double-headed, with the head shaped like a letter \"K\".  There is no trace of limbs or even limb girdles in any known fossil, and the tail was short and primitive.\n\n\n== Relationships ==\nEvolutionary relationships with other early tetrapods remain controversial, as even the earliest aistopod, the Viséan species Lethiscus stocki, was already highly specialised, although its skull was primitive and extremely fishlike. Aïstopods have been variously grouped with other lepospondyls, or placed at or prior to the batrachomorph-reptiliomorph divide. However, a cladistic analysis by Pardo et al. (2017) recovered Aistopoda at the base of Tetrapoda. The group was quite diverse during the Late Carboniferous, with a few forms continuing through to the Permian.\nBelow is a cladogram from Anderson et al. (2003) showing the phylogenetic relationships of aistopods:\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBenton, M. J. (2000), Vertebrate Paleontology, 2nd ed.

This view is no longer held and all modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians) are now grouped within the clade Lissamphibia. For a long time, the Lepospondyli were considered one of the three subclasses of Amphibia, along with the Lissamphibia and the Labyrinthodontia. However, the dissolution of \"labyrinthodonts\" into separate groups such as temnospondyls and anthracosaurs has cast doubt on these traditional amphibian subclasses.

The genus name \"Cricotus\" is dubious, as it has been used by Cope to refer to embolomere fossils spanning anywhere between mid-Pennsylvanian deposits of Illinois and the Permian red beds of Texas. Most paleontologists now refer the red bed \"Cricotus\" specimens to the genus Archeria."

Although there is evidence that the Crassigyrinus eventually lost its limbs, there is counterevidence in that it used its limbs for movement, as proven by healing in the bones in case of injury. The fact that there is a need to heal the limbs must mean there was an importance of the limbs at some point, and was then lost. The tail, only known from a few vertebrae fragments, is assumed to have been long and laterally compressed."

        "content": "Colosteidae is a family of stegocephalians (stem-group tetrapods) that lived in the Carboniferous period. They possessed a variety of characteristics from different tetrapod or stem-tetrapod groups, which made them historically difficult to classify. They are now considered to be part of a lineage intermediate between the earliest Devonian terrestrial vertebrates (such as Ichthyostega), and the different groups ancestral to all modern tetrapods, such as temnospondyls (probably ancestral to modern amphibians) and reptiliomorphs (ancestral to amniotes such as mammals, reptiles, and birds).\n\n\n== Description ==\nColosteids had elongated bodies, with an estimated 40 vertebrae, not including the tail. The skull is relatively flat and composed of many separate bones, like that of other stegocephalians. Colosteids lacked otic notches at the back of the head, unlike temnospondyls and other \"labyrinthodonts\". However, they did possess large mandibular and palatal fangs (on the lower jaw and the roof of the mouth), in addition to smaller marginal teeth (at the edge of the mouth), like \"labyrinthodonts\". The skull was overlaid with wide sensory grooves known as lateral lines, which extended from rear edge of the skull to the tip of the snout. Most aquatic stegocephalians have their lateral lines dip, unbroken, under the nostrils once they reach the tip of the snout, or alternately disconnect into separate grooves separated by the nostrils. However, colosteids evolved a unique alternative; their lateral lines droop below the nostrils so far that they contact the marginal teeth, so that the edge of the skull is responsible for subdividing the grooves, rather than the nostrils.\nThe mandibular fangs were larger than the palatal ones, though those on the palate were still large. Colosteids were unique compared to most stegocephalians in the fact that a pair of palatal fangs were present on the premaxillary bones at the tip of the snout. In conjunction with the forward position of these fangs, the dentary bones of the lower jaw developed a notch on either side near the symphysis (chin). The symphysis itself is formed by a rough area of bone on the left and right dentaries. This rough patch is formed by a complex system of ridges, which have been described as \"brassicate\" (textured like a cauliflower). Only Megalocephalus is known to share this brassicate patch with colosteids. The mandibles were also unique in the fact that they possessed a single elongated hole along their inner surface, known as an exomeckelian foramen (or a meckelian fenestra). Earlier stegocephalians like Ichthyostega possessed a subtle slit in the mandible, while most later groups had a series of smaller, well-defined holes.\n\n\n== Relationships ==\nThe analysis below was conducted by Swartz in 2012, showing the relationship of colosteids with other tetrapodomorphs.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Tetrapoda: Carboniferous Forms. Colosteidae\". Palaeos. Archived from the original on October 6, 2022.\n\"Museum of Geology & Natural History: Selected Fossils\". West Virginia: Geological & Economic Survey. Archived from the original on October 10, 2023.\nTetrapodomorpha (also known as Choanata) is a clade of vertebrates consisting of tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) and their closest sarcopterygian relatives that are more closely related to living tetrapods than to living lungfish. Advanced forms transitional between fish and the early labyrinthodonts, such as Tiktaalik, have been referred to as \"fishapods\" by their discoverers, being half-fish, half-tetrapods, in appearance and limb morphology. The Tetrapodomorpha contains the crown group tetrapods (the last common ancestor of living tetrapods and all of its descendants) and several groups of early stem tetrapods, which includes several groups of related lobe-finned fishes, collectively known as the osteolepiforms. The Tetrapodomorpha minus the crown group Tetrapoda are the stem Tetrapoda, a paraphyletic unit encompassing the fish to tetrapod transition.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nAmong the characteristics defining tetrapodomorphs are modifications to the fins, notably a humerus with convex head articulating with the glenoid fossa (the socket of the shoulder joint). Another key trait is the internal nostril or choana. Most fish have two pairs of nostrils, one on either side of the head for incoming water (incurrent nostrils) and another pair for outgoing water (excurrent nostrils). In early tetrapodomorphs like Kenichthys, the excurrent nostrils had shifted towards the mouth's perimeter. In later tetrapodomorphs, including tetrapods, the excurrent nostril is positioned inside the mouth, where it is known as the choana. The nearly-equivalent clade Choanata often refers to these later forms specifically.\n\n\n== History ==\nTetrapodomorph fossils are known from the early Devonian onwards, and include Osteolepis, Panderichthys, Kenichthys and Tungsenia. Tetrapodomorpha evolved from ancient lobe-finned fish (sarcopterygians) around 390 million years ago in the Middle Devonian period.\n\n\n== Classification ==\n\n\n=== Taxonomy ===\nAfter Benton, 2004; and Swartz, 2012.\n\nSubclass Sarcopterygii\nInfraclass Tetrapodomorpha\nOrder †Rhizodontida\nFamily †Sauripteridae\nFamily †Rhizodontidae\nSuperorder †Osteolepidida (or Osteolepiformes)\nFamily †Canowindridae\nFamily †Thysanolepidae\nFamily †Tristichopteridae\nOrder †Osteolepiformes (or Megalichthyiformes)\nFamily †Osteolepidae\nFamily †Megalichthyidae\nClade Eotetrapodiformes\nClade Elpistostegalia (or Panderichthyida)\nClade Stegocephalia\nFamily †Elpistostegidae\nFamily †Whatcheeriidae\nFamily †Colosteidae\nSuperfamily †Baphetoidea\nSuperclass Tetrapoda\nOther clades include the Eotetrapodiformes (Tinirau, Platycephalichthys, the Tristichopteridae and Elpistostegalia).

Swartz in 2012.\n\nThe following cladogram follows the results found by Clement et al. (2021).\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nStegocephali (often spelled Stegocephalia, from Greek στεγοκεφαλια, lit. \"roofed head\")  is a clade of vertebrate animals containing all fully limbed tetrapodomorphs. It is equivalent to a broad definition of the superclass Tetrapoda: under this broad definition, the term \"tetrapod\" applies to any animal descended from the first vertebrate with four limbs each with digits in the extremity (pentadactyly), rather than fins of their sarcopterygian relatives.\nStegocephalians include both the modern lineage of limbed vertebrates (the crown group tetrapods, including modern amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals) as well as a portion of the stem group, the earliest limbed tetrapodomorphs such as Ichthyostega and Acanthostega, which evolved in the Devonian period long before the origin of the crown group. Many paleontologists prefer a stricter definition of Tetrapoda which applies solely to the crown group, excluding earlier types of limbed tetrapodomorphs. Stegocephali was re-established to replace the broad definition of Tetrapoda, resolving the usage of two conflicting definitions in discussions of tetrapod evolution.\nStegocephali was coined in 1868 by the American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope, who used it as a general category of prehistoric amphibians. This name was in reference to the skull form of many early tetrapods, with a low, solid shape combining numerous strongly-textured dermal bones. In its original usage, the term quickly became obsolete. In 1998, Canadian paleontologist Michel Laurin repopularized the term and provided a formal phylogenetic definition as a monophyletic clade containing both crown-group and stem-group tetrapods. Laurin's Stegocephali is roughly defined as including all vertebrates closer to modern tetrapods than to Panderichthys. This definition was intended to include taxa with digits rather than fins, except where secondarily lost. Another definition, published in Phylonyms, defines the group as including all taxa closer to Eryops than to Tiktaalik, Panderichthys, or Eusthenopteron. The discovery of the Zachelmie trackways in 2010 suggests that stegocephalians possibly emerged 395 Ma or earlier.\n\n\n== History of classification ==\n\nOriginally, the term was used as a systematic unit at the rank of order. The term rose to prominence in American and British science in the 19th century, though the largely equivalent term Labyrinthodontia had been coined 18 years earlier by Hermann Burmeister in reference to the tooth structure. The terms were used interchangeably during the early 20th century, usually divided into three orders. Cope originally spelled the term as \"Stegocephali\", though A.S. Woodward introduced a popular alternative spelling, \"Stegocephalia\", in 1898. In their original usage, Stegocephali (and the Labyrinthodontia) are paraphyletic, the name is now used in an informal way to denote the early non-piscine vertebrates, excluding amniotes (the first reptiles and their descendants) and modern lissamphibians.\nPaleontologist Michel Laurin took up the older term and defined stegocephalians phylogenetically as all vertebrates more closely related to Temnospondyli than to Panderichthys (the closest relative of tetrapods known to have retained paired fins, see below). Therefore, Stegocephali includes all vertebrate groups that have toes rather than fins, and a few (Elginerpeton, Metaxygnathus, Ventastega and possibly Hynerpeton) that may have retained paired fins. Contrary to the old usage of this term, the Stegocephali refers to a clade in this scheme. This concept of the clade Stegocephali was chosen to substitute for the name Tetrapoda by those who sought to restrict Tetrapoda to the crown group. As such, it encompasses all presently living land vertebrates as well as their early amphibious ancestors.\n\n\n== Phylogeny ==\nBelow is an evolutionary tree of stegocephalians, as recovered from an analysis by Swartz in 2012.\n\nAs recovered by Clack et al. 2016:\n\n\n== Subgroups ==\n†Elginerpetontidae\n†\nTemnospondyli (from Greek τέμνειν, temnein 'to cut' and σπόνδυλος, spondylos 'vertebra') or temnospondyls is a diverse ancient order of small to giant tetrapods—often considered primitive amphibians—that flourished worldwide during the Carboniferous, Permian and Triassic periods, with fossils being found on every continent. A few species continued into the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous periods, but all had gone extinct by the Late Cretaceous. During about 210 million years of evolutionary history, they adapted to a wide range of habitats, including freshwater, terrestrial, and even coastal marine environments. Their life history is well understood, with fossils known from the larval stage, metamorphosis and maturity. Most temnospondyls were semiaquatic, although some were almost fully terrestrial, returning to the water only to breed. These temnospondyls were some of the first vertebrates fully adapted to life on land. Although temnospondyls are amphibians, many had characteristics such as scales and large armour-like bony plates (osteoderms) that generally distinguish them from the modern soft-bodied lissamphibians (frogs and toads, newts, salamanders and caecilians).\nTemnospondyls have been known since the early 19th century, and were initially thought to be reptiles. They were described at various times as batrachians, stegocephalians and labyrinthodonts, although these names are now rarely used. Animals now grouped in Temnospondyli were spread out among several amphibian groups until the early 20th century, when they were found to belong to a distinct taxon based on the structure of their vertebrae. Temnospondyli means \"cut vertebrae\", as each vertebra is divided into several parts (intercentrum, paired pleurocentra, neural arch), although this occurs widely among other early tetrapods.\nExperts disagree over whether temnospondyls were ancestral to modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians), or whether the whole group died out without leaving any descendants. Different hypotheses have placed modern amphibians as the descendants of temnospondyls, as descendants of another group of early tetrapods called lepospondyls, or even as descendants of both groups (with caecilians evolving from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders evolving from temnospondyls). There is further disagreement about a temnospondyl origin of lissamphibians related to whether the modern groups arose from only one group (dissorophoids) or from two different groups (dissorophoids and stereospondyls). The majority of studies place a group of temnospondyls called amphibamiforms as the closest relatives of modern amphibians. Similarities in teeth, skulls and hearing structures link the two groups. Whether temnospondyls are considered part of the tetrapod crown or stem thus depends on their inferred relationship to lissamphibians.\n\n\n== Definitions ==\n\n\n=== Branch-based definition ===\nIn 2000, Adam Yates and Anne Warren defined the name Temnospondyli as applying to the clade encompassing all organisms that are more closely related to Eryops than to the “microsaur” Pantylus. By this definition, if lissamphibians are temnospondyls and Pantylus is a reptiliomorph, the name Temnospondyli is synonymous with Batrachomorpha (a clade containing all organisms that are more closely related to modern amphibians than to mammals and reptiles).\n\n\n=== Node-based definition ===\nRainer Schoch in 2013 defined the name Temnospondyli as applying to “[t]he least inclusive clade containing Edops craigi and Mastodonsaurus giganteus”.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nMany temnospondyls are much larger than living amphibians, and superficially resemble crocodiles, which has led many taxa to be named with the suffix -suchus. The largest taxa, which were predominantly the Mesozoic stereospondyls, had skulls exceeding one meter in length, and the entire animal would have been several meters in length (for reference, the largest living amphibian, Andrias, is about 1.8 meters in body length).\nCarboniferous tetrapods include amphibians and reptiles that lived during the Carboniferous Period. Though stem-tetrapods originated in the preceding Devonian, it was in the earliest Carboniferous that the first crown tetrapods appeared, with full scaleless skin and five digits.\nDuring this time, amphibians (including many extinct groups unrelated to modern forms, referred to as \"basal tetrapods\") were the predominant tetrapods, and included the Temnospondyli, Lepospondyli, and Anthracosauria.  The first amniotes appeared during the middle Carboniferous (Early Pennsylvanian) from the lattermost group, and included both sauropsids and synapsids, but it was not until the very end of the Carboniferous, during a rainforest collapse, and afterwards that they began to diversify.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nThe following list of families of Carboniferous tetrapods is based mostly on Benton ed. 1993.

London: Chapman and Hall.\nAcherontiscus is an extinct genus of stegocephalians that lived in the Early Carboniferous (Mississippian era) of Scotland. The type and only species is Acherontiscus caledoniae, named by paleontologist Robert Carroll in 1969. Members of this genus have an unusual combination of features which makes their placement within amphibian-grade tetrapods uncertain. They possess multi-bone vertebrae similar to those of embolomeres, but also a skull similar to lepospondyls. The only known specimen of Acherontiscus possessed an elongated body similar to that of a snake or eel. No limbs were preserved, and evidence for their presence in close relatives of Acherontiscus is dubious at best. Phylogenetic analyses created by Marcello Ruta and other paleontologists in the 2000s indicate that Acherontiscus is part of Adelospondyli, closely related to other snake-like animals such as Adelogyrinus and Dolichopareias. Adelospondyls are traditionally placed within the group Lepospondyli due to their fused vertebrae (although Acherontiscus is an exception among adelospondyls). Some analyses published since 2007 have argued that adelospondyls such as Acherontiscus may not actually be lepospondyls, instead being close relatives or members of the family Colosteidae. This would indicate that they evolved prior to the split between the tetrapod lineage that leads to reptiles (Reptiliomorpha) and the one that leads to modern amphibians (Batrachomorpha). Members of this genus were probably aquatic animals that were able to swim using snake-like movements.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nAcherontiscus is known only from a single skeleton, RSM 1967/13/1, which is housed at the Royal Scottish Museum in Edinburgh. Although it is known that this specimen was discovered in 1964, additional information on the location of its discovery is not known. However, the rock slab in which it was preserved is a type known as coal shale, similar to that of early Carboniferous (Mississippian)-era ironstone from Burghlee in Midlothian. The slab also includes remains of tiny crustaceans known as ostracods, as well as pollen spores. The ostracods were identified as the late Paleozoic genus Carbonita, although different scientists studying the slabs disagree on the precise species of Carbonita. The pollen spores correspond to species of plants which lived approximately between the late Viséan and middle Namurian (Serpukhovian) ages of the Carboniferous.\n\nThis holotype skeleton was mostly complete, but poorly preserved. The skull was flattened and some of the surface was eroded, while the vertebrae were mostly missing, with only detailed impressions remaining. By dissolving away remaining fragments with hydrochloric acid casting these impressions in silicone rubber, the preparators of the specimen were able to more easily describe it. The specimen received a formal description and name as the species Acherontiscus caledoniae courtesy of Robert Carroll in 1969. The generic name Acherontiscus is a reference to Acheron, a river which in Greek mythology flowed into the underworld as a tributary of the river Styx. This naming convention is an homage to Edward Drinker Cope's affection for naming snake-like lepospondyls after infernal rivers, such as Phlegethontia (named after Phlegethon) and Cocytinus (named after Cocytus). The specific name, caledoniae, references Caledonia, the Latin name for Scotland.\n\n\n== Description ==\nAcherontiscus was serpentine in general body shape, with an elongated body and relatively small head in comparison. It may have been completely legless due to a lack of preserved limb bones. Although this hypothesis seems probable, Acherontiscus probably had limbed ancestors considering that it possessed a well-developed dermal shoulder girdle. It was small in size; the only known specimen was about 14 centimeters (5.5 inches) long. However, it may have been slightly longer considering that part of the tail is believed to be missing.\n\n\n=== Skull ===\nThe skull is robust, with sma\nA tetrapod (; from Ancient Greek τετρα- (tetra-) 'four'  and πούς (poús) 'foot') is any four-limbed vertebrate animal of the superclass Tetrapoda (). Tetrapods include all extant and extinct amphibians and amniotes, with the latter in turn evolving into two major clades, the sauropsids (reptiles, including dinosaurs and therefore birds) and synapsids (extinct pelycosaurs, therapsids and all extant mammals, including humans). Some tetrapods, such as snakes, legless lizards, and caecilians, have evolved to become limbless via mutations of the Hox gene. Nevertheless, these limbless groups still qualify as tetrapods through their ancestry, and some retain a pair of vestigial spurs that are remnants of the hindlimbs.\nTetrapods evolved from a group of primitive semiaquatic animals known as the Tetrapodomorpha which, in turn, evolved from ancient lobe-finned fish (sarcopterygians) around 390 million years ago in the Middle Devonian period. Tetrapodomorphs were transitional between lobe-finned fishes and true four-limbed tetrapods, though most still fit the body plan expected of other lobe-finned fishes. The oldest fossils of four-limbed vertebrates (tetrapods in the broad sense of the word) are trackways from the Middle Devonian, and body fossils became common near the end of the Late Devonian, around 370-360 million years ago. These Devonian species all belonged to the tetrapod stem group, meaning that they were not directly related to any modern tetrapod group. Broad anatomical descriptors like \"tetrapod\" and \"amphibian\" can approximate some members of the stem group, but a few paleontologists opt for more specific terms such as Stegocephali. Limbs evolved prior to terrestrial locomotion, but by the start of the Carboniferous Period, 360 million years ago, a few stem-tetrapods were experimenting with a semiaquatic lifestyle to exploit food and shelter on land. The first crown-tetrapods (those descended from the last common ancestors of extant tetrapods) appeared by the Visean age of the Early Carboniferous.\nThe specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods and the process by which they colonized Earth's land after emerging from water remains unclear. The transition from a body plan for gill-based aquatic respiration and tail-propelled aquatic locomotion to one that enables the animal to survive out of water and move around on land is one of the most profound evolutionary changes known. Tetrapods have numerous anatomical and physiological features that are distinct from their aquatic fish ancestors. These include distinct head and neck structures for feeding and movements, appendicular skeletons (shoulder and pelvic girdles in particular) for weight bearing and locomotion, more versatile eyes for seeing, middle ears for hearing, and more efficient heart and lungs for oxygen circulation and exchange outside water.\nStem-tetrapods and \"fish-a-pods\" were primarily aquatic. Modern amphibians, which evolved from earlier groups, are generally semiaquatic; the first stages of their lives are as waterborne eggs and fish-like larvae known as tadpoles, and later undergo metamorphosis to grow limbs and become partly terrestrial and partly aquatic. However, most tetrapod species today are amniotes, most of which are terrestrial tetrapods whose branch evolved from earlier tetrapods early in the Late Carboniferous. The key innovation in amniotes over amphibians is the amnion, which enables the eggs to retain their aqueous contents on land, rather than needing to stay in water. (Some amniotes later evolved internal fertilization, although many aquatic species outside the tetrapod tree had evolved such before the tetrapods appeared, e.g. Materpiscis.) Some tetrapods, such as snakes and caecilians, have lost some or all of their limbs through further speciation and evolution; some have only concealed vestigial bones as a remnant of the limbs of their distant ancestors. Others returned to being amphibious or otherwise living partially or fully aquatic l\nAdelospondyli is an order of elongated, presumably aquatic, Carboniferous amphibians (sensu lato). They have a robust skull roofed with solid bone, and orbits located towards the front of the skull.  The limbs were almost certainly absent, although some historical sources reported them to be present. Despite the likely absence of limbs, adelospondyls retained a large part of the bony shoulder girdle. Adelospondyls have been assigned to a variety of groups in the past. They have traditionally been seen as members of the subclass Lepospondyli, related to other unusual early tetrapods such as \"microsaurs\", \"nectrideans\", and aïstopods. Analyses such as Ruta & Coates (2007) have offered an alternate classification scheme, arguing that adelospondyls were actually far removed from other lepospondyls, instead being stem-tetrapod stegocephalians closely related to the family Colosteidae.\nMost adelospondyls belong to the family Adelogyrinidae, and prior to 2003 the order and family were considered synonymous. In 2003, Ruta et al. assigned Acherontiscus to the order as the only known non-adelogyrinid member. Members of this group are very rare; only six known specimens can be assigned to the five known genera with absolute confidence. These specimens are known from Mississippian (Serpukhovian Age) geological deposits in Scotland, and they were among the oldest \"lepospondyls\" known from fossils.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nAdelospondyls share a variety of traits with other lepospondyls, although whether these traits are an example of convergent evolution is a controversial topic. Like the aïstopods and lysorophian \"microsaurs\", they had very elongated bodies similar to that of snakes and eels. In addition, they lacked limbs (similarly to the aïstopods), although forelimbs were supposedly found in various adelogyrinids in the late 1960s. Andrews & Carroll (1991) found that all cases of forelimb bones in adelogyrinids were actually misinterpretations. For example, putative forelimbs discovered in Adelogyrinus and Palaeomolgophis by Brough & Brough (1967) were re-identified as hyoid bones and ribs, respectively. Carroll (1967) also claimed that forelimbs were present in Adelospondylus, but these later considered to be hyoids as in Adelogyrinus.\n\n\n=== Skull ===\nAdelospondyls had somewhat long and low skulls, with large orbits (eye sockets) shifted towards the front of the skull. As a result, the proportions of the skull bones were affected. For example, the nasal bones along the midline of the skull in front of the eyes were much shorter than the frontal bones directly behind them, which extended forwards past the level of the eyes. The frontal bones were omitted from the edge of the orbits (eye holes) due to a contact between the pre- and post-frontals which typically lie in front of and behind the orbits, respectively. Unlike lysorophians and aïstopods, which had snake-like skulls with large openings and reduced bone material, adelospondyl skulls were strongly built and covered with ridges, pits, and grooves, including lateral line sulci. They typically possessed many teeth, although such teeth differ in structure between families. Adelogyrinids, for example, had many numerous \"chisel-shaped\" teeth, while Acherontiscus had blunt teeth at the back of the mouth and sharp, thin teeth at the front. As is the case in other lepospondyls, the teeth of adelospondyls did not have a  maze-like internal structure like those of \"labyrinthodonts\", nor did adelospondyls possess enlarged fang-like teeth on the roof of the mouth.\n\nSimilar to various other lepospondyls, adelospondyls lost several bones in the temporal region of the skull, which is at the back of the skull between the quadratojugal bone of the jaw joint and the parietal and postparietal bones at the midline of the skull roof. Stem- and crown-tetrapods typically have three to four bones on each side of the skull in this region (from top to bottom): the tabular, supratemporal (and sometimes an adjac\nAcanthostega (meaning \"spiny roof\") is an extinct genus of stem-tetrapod, among the first vertebrate animals to have recognizable limbs. It appeared in the late Devonian period (Famennian age) about 365 million years ago, and was anatomically intermediate between lobe-finned fishes and those that were fully capable of coming onto land.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\n \nThe fossilized remains are generally well preserved, with the famous fossil by which the significance of this species  was discovered being found by Jennifer A. Clack in East Greenland in 1987, though fragments of the skull had been discovered in 1933 by Gunnar Säve-Söderbergh and Erik Jarvik.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe 60 cm (24 in) Acanthostega had eight digits on each hand (the number of digits on the feet is unclear) linked by webbing, it lacked wrists, and was generally poorly adapted for walking on land. It also had a remarkably fish-like shoulder and forelimb. The front limbs of Acanthostega could not bend forward at the elbow, and  therefore could not be brought into a weight bearing position, appearing to be more suitable for paddling or for holding on to aquatic plants. Acanthostega is the earliest stem-tetrapod to show the shift in locomotory dominance from the pectoral girdle to the pelvic girdle.\nThere are many morphological changes that allowed the pelvic girdle of Acanthostega to become a weight-bearing structure. In more ancestral states the two sides of the girdle were not attached. In Acanthostega there is contact between the two sides and fusion of the girdle with the sacral rib of the vertebral column. These fusions would have made the pelvic region more powerful and equipped to counter the force of gravity when not supported by the buoyancy of an aquatic environment. It had internal gills that were covered like those of fish. It also had lungs, but its ribs were too short to support its chest cavity out of water.\n\n\n== Classification ==\n\nAcanthostega is seen as part of widespread evolutionary radiation in the late Devonian period, starting with purely aquatic finned tetrapodomorphs, with their successors showing increased air-breathing capability and related adaptions to the jaws and gills, as well as more muscular neck allowing freer movement of the head than fish have, and use of the fins to raise the body of the fish. These features are displayed by the earlier Tiktaalik, which like Ichthyostega showed signs of greater abilities to move around on land, but is thought to have been primarily aquatic.\nIn Late Devonian vertebrate speciation, descendants of pelagic lobe-finned fish –like Eusthenopteron– exhibited a sequence of adaptations: Panderichthys, suited to muddy shallows; Tiktaalik with limb-like fins that could take it onto land; stem-tetrapods in weed-filled swamps, such as Acanthostega, which had eight-digited feet; and Ichthyostega, with full limbs. Their descendants also included pelagic lobe-finned fish such as coelacanth species.\n\n\n== Paleobiology ==\n\n\n=== Hunting strategy ===\n\nIt has been inferred that Acanthostega probably lived in shallow, weed-choked swamps, its legs apparently being adapted for these specific ecosystems. Apart from the presence of limbs, it was not adapted in any way for walking on land. Jennifer A. Clack interprets this as showing that Acanthostega was primarily an aquatic animal descended from fish that never left the sea, and that the specializations of the tetrapod lineage were exaptations: features which would later be useful for terrestrial life, even if they originated for a different purpose. At that period, deciduous plants were flourishing and annually shedding leaves into the water, attracting small prey into warm oxygen-poor shallows that were difficult for larger fish to swim in; Clack remarks on how the lower jaw of Acanthostega shows a change from those of fish that have two rows of teeth, with a large number of small teeth in the outer row, and two large fangs and some smaller teeth in the inner row. This di\nRomer's gap is an apparent gap in the Paleozoic tetrapod fossil record used in the study of evolutionary biology, which represent periods from which excavators have not yet found relevant fossils. It is named after American paleontologist Alfred Romer, who first recognised it in 1956. Recent discoveries in Scotland are beginning to close this gap in palaeontological knowledge.\n\n\n== Age ==\nRomer's gap runs from approximately 360 to 345 million years ago, corresponding to the first 15 million years of the Carboniferous, the early Mississippian (starting with the Tournaisian and moving into the Visean). The gap forms a discontinuity between the primitive forests and high diversity of fishes in the end Devonian and more modern aquatic and terrestrial assemblages of the early Carboniferous.\n\n\n== Mechanism behind the gap ==\nThere has been long debate as to why there are so few fossils from this time period. Some have suggested the problem was of fossilization itself, suggesting that there may have been differences in the geochemistry of the time that did not favour fossil formation. Also, excavators simply may not have dug in the right places. The existence of a true low point in vertebrate diversity has been supported by independent lines of evidence, however recent finds in five new locations in Scotland have yielded multiple fossils of early tetrapods and amphibians. They have also allowed the most accurate logging of the geology of this period. This new evidence suggests that - at least locally - there was no gap in diversity or changes in oxygen geochemistry.\nWhile initial arthropod terrestriality was well under way before the gap, and some digited tetrapods might have come on land, there are remarkably few terrestrial or aquatic fossils that date from the gap itself. Recent work on Paleozoic geochemistry has provided evidence for the biological reality of Romer's gap in both terrestrial vertebrates and arthropods, and has correlated it with a period of unusually low atmospheric oxygen concentration, which was determined from the idiosyncratic geochemistry of rocks formed during Romer's gap. The new sedimentary logging in the Ballagan Formation in Scotland challenges this, suggesting oxygen was stable throughout Romer's Gap.\nAquatic vertebrates, which include most tetrapods during the Carboniferous, were recovering from the Hangenberg event, a major extinction event that preceded Romer's gap, one on par with that which killed the dinosaurs. In this end-Devonian extinction, most marine and freshwater groups became extinct or were reduced to a few lineages, although the precise mechanism of the extinction is unclear. Before the event, oceans and lakes were dominated by lobe-finned fishes and armored fishes called placoderms. After the gap, modern ray finned fish, as well as sharks and their relatives were the dominant forms. The period also saw the demise of the Ichthyostegalia, the early fish-like amphibians with more than five digits.\nThe low diversity of marine fishes, particularly shell-crushing predators (durophages), at the beginning of Romer's gap is supported by the sudden abundance of hard-shelled crinoid echinoderms during the same period. The Tournaisian has even been called the \"Age of Crinoids\". Once the number of shell-crushing ray-finned fishes and sharks increased later in the Carboniferous, coincident with the end of Romer's gap, the diversity of crinoids with Devonian-type armor plummeted, following the pattern of a classic predator-prey (Lotka-Volterra) cycle. There is increasing evidence that lungfish and stem tetrapods and amphibians recovered quickly and diversified in the rapidly changing environment of the end-Devonian and Romer's Gap.\n\n\n== Gap fauna ==\n\nThe gap in the tetrapod record has been progressively closed with the discoveries of such early Carboniferous tetrapods as Pederpes and Crassigyrinus. There are a few sites where vertebrate fossils have been found to help fill in the gap, such as the East \nRhizodus (root tooth) is an extinct genus of basal, finned tetrapodomorphs (the group of sarcopterygians that contains modern tetrapods and their extinct relatives). It belonged to Rhizodontida, one of the earliest-diverging tetrapodomorph clades. Two valid species have been described, both of which lived during the Early Carboniferous epoch. The type species R. hibberti is known from the Viséan stage of the United Kingdom, whereas the species R. serpukhovensis is from the Serpukhovian of Russia. Some fossils referred to the genus Rhizodus have also been found in North America.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe most notable characteristics of Rhizodus, compared to other giant rhizodonts such as Barameda, were the two 22-centimetre (8.7 in) fangs located near the front of its jaws, followed by other teeth scaling downwards in size. Rhizodus was a giant apex predator that resided in freshwater lakes, river systems and large swamps, with R. hibberti measuring 5.14–5.63 metres (16.9–18.5 ft) long and weighing 1–1.5 metric tons (1.1–1.7 short tons). It fed on small to medium-sized amphibians, using its teeth to kill prey and rip it into digestible sizes, rather than swallowing prey whole like other, smaller-toothed sarcopterygians.\nFossil skin imprints show that Rhizodus had large, plate-like scales, similar to those found on modern day arapaima.\n\n\n== Diet ==\nThe diet of Rhizodus' included medium-sized fish and tetrapods. It has been proposed that Rhizodus lunged at terrestrial, shorebound prey, just like a modern-day crocodile.\n\n\n== References ==\nTiktaalik (; Inuktitut ᑎᒃᑖᓕᒃ [tiktaːlik]) is a monospecific genus of extinct sarcopterygian (lobe-finned fish) from the Late Devonian Period, about 375 Mya (million years ago), having many features akin to those of tetrapods (four-legged animals). Tiktaalik is estimated to have had a total length of 1.25–2.75 metres (4.1–9.0 ft) based on various specimens.\nUnearthed in Arctic Canada, Tiktaalik is a non-tetrapod member of Osteichthyes (bony fish), complete with scales and gills—but it has a triangular, flattened head and unusual, cleaver-shaped fins. Its fins have thin ray bones for paddling like most fish, but they also have sturdy interior bones that would have allowed Tiktaalik to prop itself up in shallow water and use its limbs for support as most four-legged animals do. Those fins and other mixed characteristics mark Tiktaalik as a crucial transition fossil, a link in evolution from swimming fish to four-legged vertebrates. This and similar animals might be the common ancestors of all vertebrate terrestrial fauna: amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals.\nThe first Tiktaalik fossils were found in 2004 on Ellesmere Island in Nunavut, Canada. The discovery, made by Edward B. Daeschler of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Neil H. Shubin from the University of Chicago, and Harvard University Professor Farish A. Jenkins Jr., was published in the April 6, 2006 issue of Nature and quickly recognized as a transitional form.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\n\nIn 2004, three fossilized Tiktaalik skeletons were discovered in the Late Devonian fluvial Fram Formation on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, in northern Canada. Estimated ages were reported at 375 Ma, 379 Ma and 383 Ma. At the time of the species' existence, Ellesmere Island was part of the continent Laurentia (modern eastern North America and Greenland), which was centered on the equator and had a warm climate. When discovered, one of the skulls was found sticking out of a cliff. Upon further inspection, the fossil was found to be in excellent condition for a 375-million-year-old specimen.\nThe discovery by Daeschler, Shubin and Jenkins was published in the April 6, 2006 issue of Nature and quickly recognized as a transitional form. Jennifer A. Clack, a Cambridge University expert on tetrapod evolution, said of Tiktaalik, \"It's one of those things you can point to and say, 'I told you this would exist,' and there it is.\" \n\n \nAfter five years of digging on Ellesmere Island, in the far north of Nunavut, they hit pay dirt: a collection of several fish so beautifully preserved that their skeletons were still intact. As Shubin's team studied the species they saw to their excitement that it was exactly the missing intermediate they were looking for. 'We found something that really split the difference right down the middle,' says Daeschler.\nTiktaalik is an Inuktitut word meaning \"large freshwater fish\". The \"fishapod\" genus received this name after a suggestion by Inuit elders of Canada's Nunavut Territory, where the fossil was discovered. The specific name roseae honours an anonymous donor. Taking a detailed look at the internal head skeleton of Tiktaalik roseae, in the October 16, 2008, issue of Nature, researchers show how Tiktaalik was gaining structures that could allow it to support itself on solid ground and breathe air, a key intermediate step in the transformation of the skull that accompanied the shift to life on land by our distant ancestors. More than 60 specimens of Tiktaalik have been discovered, though the holotype remains the most complete and well-described fossil.\n\n\n== Description ==\nTiktaalik provides insights on the features of the extinct closest relatives of the tetrapods. Tiktaalik was a large fish: the largest known fossils have an estimated length of 2.75 m (9.02 feet), with the longest lower jaws reaching a length of 31 centimetres (1.0 ft).\n\n\n=== Skull and neck ===\n The skull of Tiktaalik was low and flat, more similar in shape to that of a crocodile than most fish.

The type and only species is Harajicadectes zhumini, known from 13 specimens of various preservation quality.\n\n\n== Description ==\nChoo et al., (2024) assigned a holotype and paratype to Harajicadectes, NTM P6410, and CPC 39948 respectively. The holotype consists of a partial skull and much of the body outline in dorsal view with squamation preserved. The paratype consists of a partial skull, right post-temporal and right lower jaw.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe generic name, Harajicadectes (IPA: [ˌhɑːɾɑːdʒɪkɑːˈdektes]), is derived from the member the specimens were found in, the Harajica Sandstone Member, and the Greek 'dēktēs', which translates to 'biter'. The specific name, zhumini (IPA: [ˌzjuˈmɪnaɪ]), honours Prof. Min Zhu of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Beijing; China, for his numerous contributions to early vertebrate paleontology.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nChoo et al., (2024) recovered Harajicadectes as a stem-tetrapod. They reconstructed two trees collated from 336 most parsimonious trees. The first tree is a strict consensus tree, the numbers represent Bremer support values. The second tree is a 50% majority-rule consensus tree, the numbers are node support bootstrap values. Their results are reproduced below:\n\n\n== References ==\nLepospondyli is a diverse taxon of early tetrapods. With the exception of one late-surviving lepospondyl from the Late Permian of Morocco (Diplocaulus minimus), lepospondyls lived from the Visean stage of the Early Carboniferous to the Early Permian and were geographically restricted to what is now Europe and North America. Five major groups of lepospondyls are known: Adelospondyli; Aïstopoda; Lysorophia; Microsauria; and Nectridea. Lepospondyls have a diverse range of body forms and include species with newt-like, eel- or snake-like, and lizard-like forms. Various species were aquatic, semiaquatic, or terrestrial. None were large (the biggest genus, the diplocaulid Diplocaulus, reached a meter in length, but most were much smaller), and they are assumed to have lived in specialized ecological niches not taken by the more numerous temnospondyl amphibians that coexisted with them in the Paleozoic. \nLepospondyli was named in 1888 by Karl Alfred von Zittel, who coined the name to include some tetrapods from the Paleozoic that shared some specific characteristics in the notochord and teeth. Lepospondyls have sometimes been considered to be either related or ancestral to modern amphibians or to Amniota (the clade containing reptiles and mammals). It has been suggested that the grouping is polyphyletic, with aïstopods being primitive stem-tetrapods, while recumbirostran microsaurs are primitive reptiles.\n\n\n== Description ==\nAll lepospondyls are characterised by having simple, spool-shaped vertebrae that did not ossify from cartilage, but rather grew as bony cylinders around the notochord. In addition, the upper portion of the vertebra, the neural arch, is usually fused to the centrum (the main body of the vertebra).\n\n\n== Classification ==\nThe position of the Lepospondyli within the Tetrapoda is uncertain because the earliest lepospondyls were already highly specialized when they first appeared in the fossil record. Some lepospondyls were once thought to be related or perhaps ancestral to modern salamanders (Urodela), but not the other modern amphibians. This view is no longer held and all modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians) are now grouped within the clade Lissamphibia. For a long time, the Lepospondyli were considered one of the three subclasses of Amphibia, along with the Lissamphibia and the Labyrinthodontia. However, the dissolution of \"labyrinthodonts\" into separate groups such as temnospondyls and anthracosaurs has cast doubt on these traditional amphibian subclasses.  Much like \"Labyrinthodontia\", some studies proposed that Lepospondyli is an artificial (polyphyletic) grouping with some members closely related to extinct stem tetrapod groups and others more closely related to modern amphibians or reptiles. Early phylogenetic analyses conducted in the 1980s and 1990s often maintained the idea that lepospondyls were paraphyletic, with nectrideans close to colosteids and microsaurs close to temnospondyls, which were considered to be ancestral to modern amphibians.\nHowever, a 1995 paper by Robert Carroll argued that lepospondyls were actually a monophyletic group closer to reptiles. Carroll considered them closer to reptiles than the seymouriamorphs, but not as close as the diadectomorphs. Many phylogenetic analyses since Carroll (1995) agreed with his interpretation, including Laurin & Reisz (1997),  Anderson (2001), and Ruta et al. (2003). A few have still considered lepospondyls ancestral to amphibians, but came to this conclusion without changing the position of lepospondyls compared to seymouriamorphs and diadectomorphs.\nLepospondyl and tetrapod classification is still controversial, and even recent studies have had doubts about lepospondyl monophyly. For example, a 2007 paper has suggested that adelospondyls are stem-tetrapods close to colosteids and a 2017 paper on Lethiscus has  Aïstopoda in the tetrapod stem based on their primitive braincase. These studies differ in the internal and external relations\nEusthenopteron (from Greek: εὖ eû, 'good', Greek: σθένος sthénos, 'strength', and Greek: πτερόν pteron 'wing' or 'fin') is a genus of prehistoric sarcopterygian (often called \"lobe-finned\") fish known from several species that lived during the Late Devonian period, about 385 million years ago. It has attained an iconic status from its close relationship to tetrapods. Early depictions of animals of this genus show them emerging onto land, but paleontologists now think that eusthenopteron species were strictly aquatic animals, though this is not completely known.\nThe genus was first described by J. F. Whiteaves in 1881, as part of a large collection of fishes from Miguasha, Quebec, Canada. Some 2,000 Eusthenopteron specimens have been collected from Miguasha, one of which was the object of intensely detailed study and several papers by paleoichthyologist Erik Jarvik between the 1940s and the 1990s.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nEusthenopteron is a medium- to large-sized tristichopterid.  The species E. foordi is estimated to have exceeded 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) in length, while the species E. jenkinsi probably reached 2.1 m (6 ft 11 in). Eusthenopteron may have weighed around 50 kilograms.\nThe earliest known fossilized evidence of bone marrow has been found in Eusthenopteron, which may be the origin of bone marrow in tetrapods.Eusthenopteron shares many unique features among fishes but in common with the earliest-known tetrapods. It shares a similar pattern of skull roofing bones with stem tetrapoda forms such as Ichthyostega and Acanthostega. Eusthenopteron, like other tetrapodomorph fishes, had internal nostrils (or a choana), one of the defining traits of tetrapodomorphs, including tetrapods. It also had labyrinthodont teeth, characterized by infolded enamel, which characterizes all of the earliest known tetrapods as well.\nUnlike the early tetrapods, Eusthenopteron did not have larval gills.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nLike other fish-like sarcopterygians, Eusthenopteron possessed a two-part cranium, which hinged at mid-length along an intracranial joint. Eusthenopteron's notoriety comes from the pattern of its fin endoskeleton, which bears a distinct humerus, ulna, and radius in the fore-fin and femur, tibia, and fibula in the pelvic fin. These appendicular long bones had epiphyseal growth plates that allowed substantial longitudinal growth through endochondral ossification, as in tetrapod long bones. These six appendicular bones also occur in tetrapods and are a synapomorphy of a large clade of sarcopterygians, possibly Tetrapodomorpha (the humerus and femur are present in all sarcopterygians). Similarly, its elasmoid scales lack superficial odontodes composed of dentine and enamel; this loss appears to be a synapomorphy with more crownward tetrapodomorphs.\nEusthenopteron differs significantly from some later Carboniferous tetrapods in the apparent absence of a recognized larval stage and a definitive metamorphosis. In even the smallest known specimen of Eusthenopteron foordi, with a length of 29 millimetres (1.1 in), the lepidotrichia cover all of the fins, which does not happen until after metamorphosis in genera like Polydon (the American paddlefish). This might indicate that Eusthenopteron developed directly, with the hatchling already attaining the adult's general body form (Cote et al., 2002).\n\n\n== See also ==\nGogonasus\nTiktaalik – an even more tetrapod-like sarcopterygian\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nPalaeos.com – Vertebrates – Sarcopterygii (archive)\nStenokranio (from the Greek στενός [stenos] for narrow and κρανίο [kranio] for skull) is a genus of eryopid temnospondyl from the Permo-Carboniferous Remigiusberg Formation of Germany. It is represented by the type species, Stenokranio boldi, which was named for two specimens collected from the Remigiusberg quarry near Kusel, Saar–Nahe Basin, southwest Germany.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe type and only species, S. boldi, is diagnosed by three autapomorphic features of the skull that differentiate it from all other eryopids: (1) the relatively narrow posterior skull table, therefore nearly parallel lateral margins of the skull; (2) the short postparietals and tabulars; and (3) the wide ectopterygoid. The two known skulls measure 24.7 centimetres (9.7 in) (holotype) and 27 centimetres (11 in) (paratype) and are thought to represent adult, though not fully mature, individuals. The holotype is represented by a nearly complete skull and mandibles, while the paratype is represented by a partial skull, mandible, and anterior postcrania. The holotype also preserves a few isolated bones associated with diadectomorphs and 'microsaurs,' although it is not clear that these represent consumed items. In general, the skulls preserve many of the features observed in other eryopids, such as a coarsely pitted ornamentation on the surface of the skull; prominent longitudinal ridges and some transverse ridges that frame depressions on the skull; and relatively thick cranial bones. The most distinctive feature of S. boldi is a proportionately narrow skull; rather than continually broadening posteriorly, the \"cheek\" (temporal) region of the skull in S. boldi is squared-off such that the margins run parallel to each other. It is differentiated from an isolated eryopid mandible previously reported from the site on the basis of tooth positions (48–50 in Stenokranio vs. 35–40 in the isolated mandible). The postcrania differ little from those previously described in the North American Eryops, which is the sister taxon of Stenokranio based upon phylogenetic analysis.\n\n\n== Discovery and species ==\nStenokranio boldi is based on two specimens discovered in 2013 and 2018 from the Remigiusberg quarry in Rhineland-Palatinate. The quarry is a large open-cast mine that is mined for subvolcanic rock that is used in road and railroad gravel; this rock was formed from Permian-aged volcanic intrusions into rocks dated to between the latest Carboniferous and the earliest Permian (Gzhelian/Asselian) Remigiusberg Formation.\nThe taxon was named by paleontologists Ralf Werneburg (Naturhistorisches Museum Schloss Bertholdsburg Schleusingen), Florian Witzmann (Museum für Naturkunde Berlin), Larry Rinehart (New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science), Jan Fischer (Urweltmuseum GEOSKOP/Burg Licthenberg), and Sebastian Voigt (Urweltmuseum GEOSKOP/Burg Licthenberg) in the Journal of Paleontology. The species epithet honors Rudolf Bold who discovered the holotype of Cryptovenator hirschbergeri.\n\n\n== Paleobiology ==\nAs with other eryopids, the exact paleobiology of Stenokranio is disputed; Werneburg et al. (2024) propose that it was semi-aquatic, capable of moving around on land in order to migrate between habitats while also being capable of catching, and primarily feeding on, aquatic prey items such as fish, similar to modern crocodilians. As with some eryopids such as Eryops, Stenokranio lacks lateral line grooves on the skull, which is typically regarded as evidence of relative terrestriality. Of interest is that the similarly large and semi-aquatic stereospondylomorph Sclerocephalus, which is abundantly known from Germany, is unknown from Remigiusberg. This indicates that these taxa may have had sufficient ecological overlap such that only one could be present in a given locality.\n\n\n== Palaeoecology ==\n\nRemigiusberg Formation has produced a diverse record of vertebrates, including a variety of fish, 'lepospondyls', a trimerorhachid dvinosaur (Trypanognathus remiguisbergen\nPanderichthys is a genus of extinct sarcopterygian (lobe-finned fish) from the late Devonian period, about 380 Mya. Panderichthys, which was recovered from Frasnian (early Late Devonian) deposits in Latvia, is represented by two species. P. stolbovi is known only from some snout fragments and an incomplete lower jaw. P. rhombolepis is known from several more complete specimens. Although it probably belongs to a sister group of the earliest tetrapods, Panderichthys exhibits a range of features transitional between tristichopterid lobe-fin fishes (e.g., Eusthenopteron) and early tetrapods. It is named after the German-Baltic paleontologist Christian Heinrich Pander. Possible tetrapod tracks dating back to before the appearance of Panderichthys in the fossil record were reported in 2010, which suggests that Panderichthys is not a direct ancestor of tetrapods, but nonetheless shows the traits that evolved during the fish-tetrapod evolution \n\n\n== Discovery and history ==\nPanderichthys is represented by two different species: Panderichthys rhombolepis and Panderichthys stobolvi. P. rhombolepis was discovered by Gross in 1930 and P. stobolvi was discovered and figured by Emilia Vorobyeva in 1960. P. rhombolepis was discovered in Lode, Latvia within Frasnian deposits and according to P.E. Ahlberg can definitely be found in other Frasnian deposits in Latvia. Although fossils of Panderichthys have been known for a long time, they have only recently been examined in full. The first time they were recognized as being phylogenetically closer to tetrapods than fish was by Shultze and Arsenault in 1985.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nPanderichthys is a 1.5–2 m (4 ft 11 in – 6 ft 7 in) long fish with a large tetrapod-like head that is flattened, narrow at the snout and wide in the back. The intracranial joint, which is characteristic of most lobe-fin fishes, has been lost from the external elements of the skull, but is still present in the braincase. The patterns of external bones in the skull roof and cheeks are more similar to those of early tetrapods than those of other lobe-fins. The transitional qualities of Panderichthys are also evident in the rest of the body. It lacks the dorsal and anal fins (fish fin) and its tail is more like those of early tetrapods than the caudal fins of other lobe-fins. The shoulders exhibit several tetrapod-like features, while the humerus is longer than those found in other lobe-fins. The vertebral column is ossified throughout its length and the vertebrae are comparable to those of early tetrapods. On the other hand, the distal parts of the front fins are unlike those of tetrapods. As would be expected from a fin, there are numerous lepidotrichia (long and thin fin rays).\nPanderichthys has many features that can be considered an intermediate form during the fish-tetrapod evolution and displays some features that are more derived than its phylogenetic position indicates, while others that are more basal. The body form of Panderichthys and Tiktaalik represents a major step in the transition from fish to tetrapods and they were even able to haul out on land. According to Shultze and Trueb, Panderichthys shares ten features with tetrapods:\n\nThe skull roof is flat compared to fish skulls.\nThe orbits are more dorsal and lie closer together.\nThe external naris is close to the margin of the upper jaw.\nFrontals are paired.\nThere is no external intracranial joint.\nThe parietal bone is located between the orbits and main portion posterior to orbits.\nIn  P. rhombolepis, the squamosal touches the maxilla (varies among specimens though).\nThe teeth have a complex polyplocodont structure.\nA lack of median fins.\nIn panderichthyids and Ichthyostega, the ribs are attached to the neural arch and there is an intercentrum.\n\n\n=== Humerus ===\nOne of the key transitional features of Panderichthys is its humerus. During the transition from fish to tetrapods the limbs began to move and became located at a right angle to the body rather than be\nGaiasia is an extinct genus of stem-tetrapods from the Early Permian of Namibia, containing a single species, Gaiasia jennyae. Gaiasia was a freshwater predator which was exceptional among stem-tetrapods for its combination of relatively enormous size, Southern occurrence, and late survival.\nGaiasia is known from three fossil specimens, including an incomplete skeleton with a crushed skull and partial vertebral column. Though limb material is not preserved, the skull of Gaiasia indicates that its affinities lie with digit-bearing stem-tetrapods (early amphibians, in the broad sense). It was a close relative to the colosteids, a family of aquatic stem-tetrapods with long bodies and small limbs. Most digit-bearing stem-tetrapods, including the colosteids, go extinct by the Carboniferous rainforest collapse near the end of the preceding Carboniferous Period. Gaiasia is one of the few to survive into the Permian alongside crown-tetrapods (the groups directly ancestral to living amphibians, mammals, and reptiles).\nGaiasia is the largest known digit-bearing stem-tetrapods, with an estimated maximum skull length reaching 60 centimetres (24 in). It was found in the Gai-As Formation, a rock unit corresponding to cold temperate lake environments located near the South Pole (around 55° South) in the Permian. Other digit-bearing stem tetrapods were significantly smaller (skulls under 40 centimetres (16 in) in length), and nearly all were restricted to the tropics of Euramerica, a low-latitude region equivalent to present-day Europe and North America. Gaiasia hints that stem-tetrapods in Southern latitudes continued to persist and evolve through the Late Paleozoic icehouse interval, even as low-latitude species died out and were supplanted by crown-tetrapods. Gaiasia's genus name references the Gai-As Formation, while the species name honors the late Jenny Clack, an expert in early tetrapods.\n\n\n== Description ==\nGaiasia has a broad flattened skull, large keeled branchial elements (throat or gill bones), a reinforced neck, and massive interlocking fangs at the front of the snout. Together these traits indicate that it was well-adapted for both suction feeding and a strong bite. The front edge of the snout is not fully preserved, but the profile of the skull shows that the snout is short and boxy. The bones of the skull roof are thin and ornamented by radiating ridges and grooves. A pineal foramen is absent, but lateral line canals are well-developed and a small intertemporal bone is present. Most unique features relate to the palate (roof of the mouth). The parasphenoid bone (which forms the floor of the braincase) is large and wide, with a blunt front tip, but the interpterygoid vacuities (large holes which flank the parasphenoid) are narrow. The paired bones at the front of the palate have large fangs: two fangs on each vomer, one per palatine, and one per ectopterygoid. Each fang is paired with a large pit which hosts developing replacement teeth.\nThe lower jaw is rather thin and smoothly curved at the front, but thickens further back and extends past the jaw joint. Several fangs occur at the front of the lower jaw, with three on each side (six in total). Two of the three fangs are adjacent to the symphysis (the point where the two sides of the jaw converge at the middle). These two fangs are hosted by the adsymphyseal and dentary bones. The largest fang is located a bit further back, on an enlarged first coronoid bone which swells inwards from the rim of the jaw. The neck joint is a strong hinge, formed from the contact between a pair of exoccipital condyles (rounded surfaces on the braincase) and a partially fused atlas-axis complex (the first few neck vertebrae). Paired exoccipital condyles have convergently evolved in a number of crown-tetrapod lineages (lissamphibians, stereospondyls, some \"lepospondyls\", and mammals), none of which are related to Gaiasia. On the edge of the braincase, a spur of bone divides the spiracular cleft (a \nEmbolomeri is an order of tetrapods or stem-tetrapods, possibly members of Reptiliomorpha. Embolomeres first evolved in the Early Carboniferous (Mississippian) Period and were the largest and most successful predatory tetrapods of the Late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) Period. They were specialized semiaquatic predators with long bodies for eel-like undulatory swimming. Embolomeres are characterized by their vertebral centra, which are formed by two cylindrical segments, the pleurocentrum at the rear and intercentrum at the front. These segments are equal in size. Most other tetrapods have pleurocentra and intercentra which are drastically different in size and shape.\nEmbolomeres were among the earliest large carnivorous tetrapods, with members such as the crocodilian-like Proterogyrinus appearing in the Visean stage of the Carboniferous. They declined in diversity during the Permian period, though at least one representative (Archeria) was common in the Early Permian. Embolomeres went extinct shortly before the end of the Permian.\n\n\n== Classification ==\n\nThe order Embolomeri was first named by Edward Drinker Cope in 1884 during his revision of \"batrachian\" (amphibian) evolution. Embolomeri was differentiated from several other newly named amphibian orders, such as \"Rachitomi\", by the presence of intercentra and pleurocentra of the same size and shape, that being large cylinders. At the time, embolomere fossils were uncommon, so Cope could only identify \"cricotids\" such as Cricotus as possessing embolomerous vertebrae. The genus name \"Cricotus\" is dubious, as it has been used by Cope to refer to embolomere fossils spanning anywhere between mid-Pennsylvanian deposits of Illinois and the Permian red beds of Texas. Most paleontologists now refer the red bed \"Cricotus\" specimens to the genus Archeria.\nMichel Laurin (1998) formally defined Embolomeri as \"the last common ancestor of Proterogyrinus and Archeria and all of its descendants.\" This definition excludes Eoherpeton, which is almost always considered a close ally of the group. Some authors place Silvanerpeton or chroniosuchians as close relatives as well, though they are generally agreed to lie outside Embolomeri proper.\nThe poorly-defined group Anthracosauria is sometimes considered synonymous with Embolomeri, and the group's namesake, Anthracosaurus, is an embolomere. However, other authors use the term \"Anthracosauria\" in reference to a broader group which includes embolomeres in combination with various other reptile-like amphibians (reptiliomorphs). Reptiliomorphs are all tetrapods more closely related to living reptiles and synapsids (mammals and their ancestors), rather than living amphibians. Despite this, reptiliomorphs likely had amphibian-like biological traits, such as water-based reproduction.\nMany studies conducted since the 1990s have also placed the group Lepospondyli as closer to amniotes than embolomeres were. Lepospondyls are a particularly unusual group of tetrapods, with some members (i.e. brachystelechids) very similar to lissamphibians and others (i.e. tuditanids) very similar to amniotes. If lepospondyls are both close relatives of amniotes and the ancestors of modern amphibians, then that means that crown-Tetrapoda (descendants of the common ancestor to all living tetrapods) is a much more restricted group than previously assumed. In this situation, various traditional orders of Tetrapoda such as Embolomeri and Temnospondyli actually would qualify as stem-tetrapods due to having evolved prior to the split between modern amphibians and amniotes.\nHowever, most authors consider temnospondyls to be the ancestors of modern amphibians. This would suggest that embolomeres are likely reptiliomorphs (closer to reptiles) and within the clade Tetrapoda. However, even this classification is not stable, as some analyses have found embolomeres to be more basal than temnospondyls.\nBelow is a cladogram from Ruta et al. (2003):\n\n\n== Genera ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\"Labyrinthodontia\" (Greek, 'maze-toothed') is an informal grouping of extinct predatory amphibians which were major components of ecosystems in the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras (about 390 to 150 million years ago). Traditionally considered a subclass of the class Amphibia, modern classification systems recognize that labyrinthodonts are not a formal natural group (clade) exclusive of other tetrapods. Instead, they consistute an evolutionary grade (a paraphyletic group), ancestral to living tetrapods such as lissamphibians (modern amphibians) and amniotes (reptiles, mammals, and kin). \"Labyrinthodont\"-grade vertebrates evolved from lobe-finned fishes in the Devonian, though a formal boundary between fish and amphibian is difficult to define at this point in time.\n\"Labyrinthodont\" generally refers to extinct four-limbed tetrapods with a large body size and a crocodile-like lifestyle. The name describes the pattern of infolding of the dentin and enamel of the teeth, which are often the only part of the creatures that fossilize. They are also distinguished by a broad, strongly-built skull roof composed of many small heavily-textured skull bones. \"Labyrinthodonts\" generally have complex multi-part vertebrae, and several classification schemes have utilized vertebrae to define subgroups.\nBecause labyrinthodonts do not form a monophyletic group, many modern researchers have abandoned the term. However, some have continued to use the group in their classifications, at least informally, pending more detailed study of their relationships. Many authors prefer to simply use the term tetrapod, while others have re-defined the previously obsolete term Stegocephalia (\"roof heads\") as a cladistic alternative to \"Labyrinthodontia\" or \"Tetrapoda\".\n\n\n== Labyrinthodont traits ==\n\nThe labyrinthodonts flourished for more than 200 million years. Particularly the early forms exhibited a lot of variation, yet there are still a few basic anatomical traits that make their fossils very distinct and easily recognizable in the field:\n\nStrongly folded tooth surface, involving infolding of the dentin and enamel of the teeth. The cross section resembles a classical labyrinth (or maze), hence the name of the group.\nMassive skull roof, with openings only for the nostrils, eyes and a parietal eye, similar to the structure of the \"anapsid\" reptiles. With the exception of the later more reptile-like forms, the skull was rather flat and strongly ornamented with presumably tough dermal covering, accounting for an older term for the group: \"Stegocephalia\".\nOtic notch behind each eye at the back edge of the skull. In earlier fully aquatic forms such as Ichthyostega, it may have formed an open spiracle. In later terrestrial forms such as Seymouria, it may possibly have held a tympanic membrane (eardrum).\nComplex vertebrae made of multiple components: an intercentrum (wedge-shaped front lower piece), two pleurocentra (upper rear piece), and a vertebral arch/spine (upper projection). The relative development and shape of the elements is highly variable.\n\n\n== The labyrinthodonts in life ==\n\n\n=== General build ===\nLabyrinthodonts were generally amphibian-like in build. They were short-legged and mostly large headed, with moderately short to long tails. Many groups, and all the early forms, were large animals. Primitive members of all labyrinthodont groups were probably true water predators, and various degrees of amphibious, semi-aquatic and semi terrestrial modes of living arose independently in different groups. Some lineages remained waterbound or became secondarily fully aquatic with reduced limbs and elongated, eel-like bodies.\n\n\n=== Skull ===\n\nWith the exception of the snake-like aïstopods, the skulls of labyrinthodonts were massive.  The broad head and short neck may have been a result of respiratory constraints. Their jaws were lined with small, sharp, conical teeth and the roof of the mouth bore larger tusk-like teeth. The teeth were replaced in waves th\nHyneria is a genus of large prehistoric predatory lobe-finned fish which lived in fresh water during the Famennian stage of the Devonian period.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe genus name Hyneria is a reference to the village of Hyner, Pennsylvania, near where the first specimen was found. The species epithet H. lindae is derived from the name of the wife of Keith Stewart Thomson, who described this fish.\n\n\n== Description ==\nHyneria was a large fish. H. lindae is estimated around 2.5–3 metres (8.2–9.8 ft) in total length. An isolated cleithrum AM 6545 likely belongs to an individual of at least 2.7 metres (8.9 ft) in length. The largest complete jaw reaches 38 centimetres (15 in), but there is much larger fragment possibly from a jaw about twice that length, although that specimen may belong to a rhizodont instead. Assuming this jaw fragment does pertain to Hyneria, and assuming proportions similar to more complete tristichopterids, it suggests H. lindae could possibly reach lengths up to 3.5 metres (11 ft). A second species, H. uldezinye, was once estimated as having a length of between 2 and 4 metres (6.6 and 13.1 ft) before being described. However, the species description estimates that the largest specimen belongs to an animal about 3 metres (9.8 ft). Its skull had heavy, ornamented dermal bones and its lower jaw was relatively long and shallow. The teeth were stout, with those of the premaxilla forming fangs upwards of 5 cm (2 in). Its body was covered by cycloid scales. It had large sensory canals to aid in detection of possible prey, as the freshwater environment it inhabited likely was murky and had low visibility. Adult individuals retained juvenile features (i.e. partially unossified skeletons), suggesting that they were likely neotenic.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\n\nThe original fossils came from two localities in Pennsylvania, United States, one found between the villages of North Bend and Hyner and another near Emporium. They consisted of a disarticulated partial skull and fragments of the shoulder girdle. The fossils were found in the Catskill Formation of the Red Hill Shale, dating to the upper Devonian. These were the only remains known until 1993 when a renewed collecting effort discovered abundant new material. Hyneria is considered the largest and most common lobe-finned fish found in the Red Hill Shale. In February 2023 a second species of Hyneria, H. udlezinye, was named from remains discovered in the Waterloo Farm lagerstätte. These remains include the skull and shoulder girdle.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHyneria Archived 2008-05-11 at the Wayback Machine at Devonian Times\nIchthyostega (from Greek: ἰχθῦς ikhthûs, 'fish' and Greek: στέγη stégē, 'roof') is an extinct genus of limbed tetrapodomorphs from the Late Devonian of what is now Greenland. It was among the earliest four-limbed vertebrates ever in the fossil record and was one of the first with weight-bearing adaptations for terrestrial locomotion. Ichthyostega possessed lungs and limbs that helped it navigate through shallow water in swamps. Although Ichthyostega is often labelled a 'tetrapod' because of its limbs and fingers, it evolved long before true crown group tetrapods and could more accurately be referred to as a stegocephalian or stem tetrapod. Likewise, while undoubtedly of amphibian build and habit, it is not a true member of the group in the narrow sense, as the first modern amphibians (members of the group Lissamphibia) appeared in the Triassic Period. Until finds of other early stegocephalians and closely related fishes in the late 20th century, Ichthyostega stood alone as a transitional fossil between fish and tetrapods, combining fish and tetrapod features. Newer research has shown that it had an unusual anatomy, functioning more akin to a seal than a salamander, as previously assumed.\n\n\n== History ==\n \nIn 1932 Gunnar Säve-Söderbergh described four Ichthyostega species from the Late Devonian of East Greenland and one species belonging to the genus Ichthyostegopsis, I. wimani. These species could be synonymous (in which case only I. stensioei would remain), because their morphological differences are not very pronounced. The species differ in skull proportions, skull punctuation and skull bone patterns. The comparisons were done on 14 specimens collected in 1931 by the Danish East Greenland Expedition. Additional specimens were collected between 1933 and 1955.\n\n\n== Description ==\nIchthyostega was a fairly large animal for its time, as it was broadly built and about 1.5 m (4.9 ft) long. The skull was low, with dorsally placed eyes and large labyrinthodont teeth. The posterior margin of the skull formed an operculum covering the gills. The spiracle was situated in an otic notch behind each eye. Computed tomography has revealed that Ichthyostega had a specialized ear, including a stapes with a unique morphology compared to other tetrapods or to any fish hyomandibula. \n\n\n=== Postcranial skeleton ===\nThe legs were large compared to contemporary relatives. It had seven digits on each hind leg, along with a peculiar, poorly ossified mass which lies anteriorly adjacent to the digits. The exact number of digits on the forelimb is not yet known, since fossils of the hand have not been found. While in water, the foot would have functioned like a fleshy paddle more than a fin.The vertebral column and ribcage of Ichthyostega was unusual and highly specialized relative to both its contemporaries and later tetrapods. The thoracic vertebrae at the front of the trunk and the short neck have tall neural spines that lean backwards. They attach to pointed ribs which increase in size and acquire prominent overlapping flanges. Past the sixth or seventh flanged rib, the ribs abruptly decrease in size and lose their flanges. The lumbar vertebrae at the back of the trunk have strong muscle scars and neural spines which are bent forwards and decrease in size towards the hips. The sacral vertebrae above the hips have fan-shaped neural spines that transition from forward-leaning to backward-leaning as they approach the tail. The vertebrae right behind the hips have unusually large ribs similar to those of the thoracic region. The caudal vertebrae have slender spines that lean backwards. The tail of Ichthyostega retained a low fin supported by bony lepidotrichia (fin rays). The tail fin was not as deep as in Acanthostega, and would have been less useful for swimming.\n\nIchthyostega is related to Acanthostega gunnari, which is also from what is now East Greenland. Ichthyostega's skull seems more fish-like than that of Acanthostega, but its pelvic girdle mo\nElpistostegalia is a clade containing Panderichthys and all more derived tetrapodomorph taxa. The earliest elpistostegalians, combining fishlike and tetrapod-like characters, such as Tiktaalik, are sometimes called fishapods. Although historically Elpistostegalia (referred to as Panderichthyida) was considered an order of prehistoric lobe-finned fishes, it was cladistically redefined to include tetrapods.\n\n\n== Paleobiology ==\nA rise in global oxygen content allowed for the evolution of large, predatory fish that were able to exploit the shallow tidal areas and swamplands as top predators. Several groups evolved to fill these niches, the most successful were the elpistiostegalians. In such environments, they would have been challenged by periodic oxygen deficiency.  In comparable modern aquatic environments like shallow eutrophic lakes and swampland, modern lungfish and some genera of catfish also rely on the more stable, atmospheric source of oxygen.\nBeing shallow-water fishes, the elpistostegalians evolved many of the basic adaptions that later allowed the tetrapods to become terrestrial animals. The most important ones were the shift of main propulsion apparatus from the tail fin to the pectoral and pelvic fins, and a shift to reliance on lungs rather than gills as the main means of obtaining oxygen. Both of these appear to be a direct result of moving to an inland freshwater mode of living.\nFossils of Panderichthys are dated to the Givetian (around 385 million years old) or the Frasnian (around 380–375 million years old).  Thus, the oldest bone remains of elpistostegalians appear in the late Middle Devonian or in the early Late Devonian. However, a series of trace fossils from the early Middle Devonian of Poland suggests that tetrapod-limbed animals may have existed as early as in the Eifelian, around 395 million years ago.\n\n\n== Traits ==\nPaleontologist and professor Per E. Ahlberg has identified the following traits as synapomorphic for Elpistostegalia (and thus Tetrapoda):\n\nThe endocranium is hinged, the hinge forming the profundus nerve foramen. The cranial kinesis is also visible in the skull roof, between the parietal bones and the postparietal bones.\nA rather small shoulder girdle is present.\nThe anal and posterior dorsal fin supported by a basal plate and three unjointed radials.\nThe pectoral fin skeleton is composed of bones homologous to the tetrapod humerus, ulna, and radius, followed by a host of smaller bones anchoring the fin rays; the pelvic fin skeleton similarly has femur, tibia, and fibula.\n\n\n== Phylogeny ==\nThe name, originally coined around the genus Elpistostege, later become a synonym for Panderichthyida. In most analyses, the group as traditionally imagined is actually an evolutionary grade, the last \"fishes\" of the tetrapod stem line, though Chang and Yu (1997) treated them as the sister clade to Tetrapoda. Elpistostegalia was re-defined as a clade containing Panderichthys and tetrapods.\nBelow is a cladogram from Swartz, 2012.\n\nThe 2020 study by Cloutier et al. revealed that the paired fins of Elpistostege contained bones homologous to the phalanges (digit bones) of modern tetrapods. The analysis carried out in this study recovered Elpistostege as the sister taxon of all unequivocally digited vertebrates.\n\n\n== References ==\nEryops (; from Greek ἐρύειν, eryein, 'drawn-out' + ὤψ, ops, 'face', because most of its skull was in front of its eyes) is a genus of extinct, amphibious temnospondyls. It contains the single species Eryops megacephalus, the fossils of which are found mainly in early Permian (about 295 million years ago) rocks of the Texas Red Beds, located in Archer County, Texas. Fossils have also been found in late Carboniferous period rocks from New Mexico. Several complete skeletons of Eryops have been found in lower Permian rocks, but skull bones and teeth are its most common fossils.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nEryops averaged a little over 1.5–2.0 m (4 ft 11 in – 6 ft 7 in) long and could grow up to 3 m (9 ft 10 in), making them among the largest land animals of their time. Adults weighed between 102 and 222 kg (225 and 489 lb). The skull was proportionately large, being broad and flat and reaching lengths of 60 cm (24 in). It had an enormous mouth with many curved teeth, like those of frogs. Its teeth had enamel with a folded pattern, leading to its early classification as a \"labyrinthodont\" (\"maze toothed\"). The shape and cross section of Eryops teeth made them exceptionally strong and resistant to stresses. The palate, or roof of the mouth, contained three pairs of backward-curved fangs, and was covered in backward-pointing bony projections which would have been used to trap slippery prey once caught. This, coupled with the wide gape, suggest an inertial method of feeding, in which the animal would grasp its prey and thrust forward, forcing the prey farther back into its mouth.\nEryops was much more strongly built and sturdy than its relatives, and had the most massive and heavily ossified skeleton of all known temnospondyls. The limbs were especially large and strong. The pectoral girdle was highly developed, with a larger size for increased muscle attachments. Most notably, the shoulder girdle was disconnected from the skull, resulting in improved terrestrial locomotion. The crossopterygian cleithrum was retained as the clavicle, and the interclavicle was well-developed, lying on the underside of the chest. In primitive forms, the two clavicles and the interclavicle could have grown ventrally in such a way as to form a broad chest plate, although such was not the case in Eryops. The upper portion of the girdle had a flat scapular blade, with the glenoid cavity situated below performing as the articulation surface for the humerus, while ventrally there was a large flat coracoid plate turning in toward the midline.\nThe pelvic girdle also was much larger than the simple plate found in fishes, accommodating more muscles. It extended far dorsally and was joined to the backbone by one or more specialized sacral ribs. The hind legs were somewhat specialized in that they not only supported weight, but also provided propulsion. The dorsal extension of the pelvis was the ilium, while the broad ventral plate was composed of the pubis in front and the ischium behind. The three bones met at a single point in the center of the pelvic triangle, called the acetabulum, providing a surface of articulation for the femur.\nThe texture of Eryops skin was revealed by a fossilized \"mummy\" described in 1941. This mummy specimen showed that the body in life was covered in a pattern of oval bumps.\n\n\n== Discovery and species ==\n\nEryops is currently thought to contain only one species, E. megacephalus, which means \"large-headed Eryops\". E. megacephalus fossils have been found only in rocks dated to the early Permian period (Sakmarian age, about 295 million years ago) in the southwestern United States, primarily in the Admiral Formation of the Texas Red Beds. During the mid-20th century, some older fossils were classified as a second species of Eryops, E. avinoffi. This species, known from Carboniferous period fossil found in Pennsylvania, had originally been classified in the genus Glaukerpeton. Beginning in the late 1950s, some scientists concluded that Glaukerpeton\nReptiliomorpha (meaning reptile-shaped; in PhyloCode known as Pan-Amniota) is a clade containing the amniotes and those tetrapods that share a more recent common ancestor with amniotes than with living amphibians (lissamphibians). It was defined by Michel Laurin (2001) and Vallin and Laurin (2004) as the largest clade that includes Homo sapiens, but not Ascaphus truei (tailed frog). Laurin and Reisz (2020) defined Pan-Amniota as the largest total clade containing Homo sapiens, but not Pipa pipa, Caecilia tentaculata, and Siren lacertina.\nThe informal variant of the name, \"reptiliomorphs\", is also occasionally used to refer to stem-amniotes, i.e. a grade of reptile-like tetrapods that are more closely related to amniotes than they are to lissamphibians, but are not amniotes themselves; the name is used in this meaning e.g. by Ruta, Coates and Quicke (2003). An alternative name, \"Anthracosauria\", is also commonly used for the group, but is confusingly also used for a more primitive grade of reptiliomorphs (Embolomeri) by Benton. While both anthracosaurs and/or embolomeres are suggested to be reptiliomorphs closer to amniotes, some recent studies either retain them as amphibians or argue that their relationships are still ambiguous and are more likely to be stem-tetrapods.\nAs the exact phylogenetic position of Lissamphibia within Tetrapoda remains uncertain, it also remains controversial which fossil tetrapods are more closely related to amniotes than to lissamphibians, and thus, which ones of them were reptiliomorphs in any meaning of the word. The two major hypotheses for lissamphibian origins are that they are either descendants of dissorophoid temnospondyls or microsaurian \"lepospondyls\". If the former (the \"temnospondyl hypothesis\") is true, then Reptiliomorpha includes all tetrapod groups that are closer to amniotes than to temnospondyls. These include the diadectomorphs, seymouriamorphs, most or all \"lepospondyls\", gephyrostegids, and possibly the embolomeres and chroniosuchians. In addition, several \"anthracosaur\" genera of uncertain taxonomic placement would also probably qualify as reptiliomorphs, including Solenodonsaurus, Eldeceeon, Silvanerpeton, and Casineria. However, if lissamphibians originated among the lepospondyls according to the \"lepospondyl hypothesis\", then Reptiliomorpha refers to groups that are closer to amniotes than to lepospondyls. Few non-amniote groups would count as reptiliomorphs under this definition, although the diadectomorphs are among those that qualify.\n\n\n== Changing definitions ==\nThe name Reptiliomorpha was coined by Professor Gunnar Säve-Söderbergh in 1934 to designate amniotes and various types of late Paleozoic tetrapods that were more closely related to amniotes than to living amphibians. In his view, the amphibians had evolved from fish twice, with one group composed of the ancestors of modern salamanders and the other, which Säve-Söderbergh referred to as Eutetrapoda, consisting of anurans (frogs), amniotes, and their ancestors, with the origin of caecilians being uncertain. Säve-Söderbergh's Eutetrapoda consisted of two sister-groups: Batrachomorpha, containing anurans and their ancestors, and Reptiliomorpha, containing anthracosaurs and amniotes. Säve-Söderbergh subsequently added Seymouriamorpha to his Reptiliomorpha as well.\nAlfred Sherwood Romer rejected Säve-Söderbergh's theory of a biphyletic amphibia and used the name Anthracosauria to describe the \"labyrinthodont\" lineage from which amniotes evolved. In 1970, the German paleontologist Alec Panchen took up Säve-Söderbergh's name for this group as having priority, but Romer's terminology is still in use, e.g. by Carroll (1988 and 2002) and by Hildebrand & Goslow (2001). Some writers preferring phylogenetic nomenclature use Anthracosauria.\nIn 1956, Friedrich von Huene included both amphibians and anapsid reptiles in the Reptiliomorpha. This included the following orders: Anthracosauria, Seymouriamorpha, Microsauria, Diadectomo",

This name was in reference to the skull form of many early tetrapods, with a low, solid shape combining numerous strongly-textured dermal bones. In its original usage, the term quickly became obsolete. In 1998, Canadian paleontologist Michel Laurin repopularized the term and provided a formal phylogenetic definition as a monophyletic clade containing both crown-group and stem-group tetrapods. Laurin's Stegocephali is roughly defined as including all vertebrates closer to modern tetrapods than to Panderichthys. This definition was intended to include taxa with digits rather than fins, except where secondarily lost. Another definition, published in Phylonyms, defines the group as including all taxa closer to Eryops than to Tiktaalik, Panderichthys, or Eusthenopteron.

Like the aïstopods and lysorophian \"microsaurs\", they had very elongated bodies similar to that of snakes and eels. In addition, they lacked limbs (similarly to the aïstopods), although forelimbs were supposedly found in various adelogyrinids in the late 1960s. Andrews & Carroll (1991) found that all cases of forelimb bones in adelogyrinids were actually misinterpretations. For example, putative forelimbs discovered in Adelogyrinus and Palaeomolgophis by Brough & Brough (1967) were re-identified as hyoid bones and ribs, respectively. Carroll (1967) also claimed that forelimbs were present in Adelospondylus, but these later considered to be hyoids as in Adelogyrinus."

This view is no longer held and all modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians) are now grouped within the clade Lissamphibia. For a long time, the Lepospondyli were considered one of the three subclasses of Amphibia, along with the Lissamphibia and the Labyrinthodontia. However, the dissolution of \"labyrinthodonts\" into separate groups such as temnospondyls and anthracosaurs has cast doubt on these traditional amphibian subclasses.

It has attained an iconic status from its close relationship to tetrapods. Early depictions of animals of this genus show them emerging onto land, but paleontologists now think that eusthenopteron species were strictly aquatic animals, though this is not completely known.\nThe genus was first described by J. F. Whiteaves in 1881, as part of a large collection of fishes from Miguasha, Quebec, Canada. Some 2,000 Eusthenopteron specimens have been collected from Miguasha, one of which was the object of intensely detailed study and several papers by paleoichthyologist Erik Jarvik between the 1940s and the 1990s."

At the time, embolomere fossils were uncommon, so Cope could only identify \"cricotids\" such as Cricotus as possessing embolomerous vertebrae. The genus name \"Cricotus\" is dubious, as it has been used by Cope to refer to embolomere fossils spanning anywhere between mid-Pennsylvanian deposits of Illinois and the Permian red beds of Texas.

However, other authors use the term \"Anthracosauria\" in reference to a broader group which includes embolomeres in combination with various other reptile-like amphibians (reptiliomorphs). Reptiliomorphs are all tetrapods more closely related to living reptiles and synapsids (mammals and their ancestors), rather than living amphibians.

The limbs were especially large and strong. The pectoral girdle was highly developed, with a larger size for increased muscle attachments. Most notably, the shoulder girdle was disconnected from the skull, resulting in improved terrestrial locomotion. The crossopterygian cleithrum was retained as the clavicle, and the interclavicle was well-developed, lying on the underside of the chest. In primitive forms, the two clavicles and the interclavicle could have grown ventrally in such a way as to form a broad chest plate, although such was not the case in Eryops. The upper portion of the girdle had a flat scapular blade, with the glenoid cavity situated below performing as the articulation surface for the humerus, while ventrally there was a large flat coracoid plate turning in toward the midline."

It extended far dorsally and was joined to the backbone by one or more specialized sacral ribs. The hind legs were somewhat specialized in that they not only supported weight, but also provided propulsion. The dorsal extension of the pelvis was the ilium, while the broad ventral plate was composed of the pubis in front and the ischium behind. The three bones met at a single point in the center of the pelvic triangle, called the acetabulum, providing a surface of articulation for the femur.\nThe texture of Eryops skin was revealed by a fossilized \"mummy\" described in 1941. This mummy specimen showed that the body in life was covered in a pattern of oval bumps."

        "original_uuid": "c3faf1c0dc9240623091b07862435a32",
        "content": "Deltaherpeton is an extinct genus of colosteid from middle Mississippian (late Viséan age) deposits of Delta, Iowa, United States. It was first named by John R. Bolt and R. Eric Lombard in 2010 and the type species is Deltaherpeton hiemstrae.\nDeltaherpeton can be differentiated from other colosteids due to possessing several unique bones along the midline of the skull, separating paired skull bones which typically contact each other along the midline. These include an internasal, an oval-shaped bone which lies at the intersection of the paired premaxillae and nasal bones at the top of the snout. Internasals are known from several of the earliest four-limbed vertebrates, such as Acanthostega, Ichthyostega, and baphetids. Further back, what seems to be a pair of lozenge-shape bones lie at the intersection of the nasal bones and frontal bones. These bones may be interfrontonasals, which have been found in some eryopoids and microsaurs.\nIn addition, Deltaherpeton has a single postparietal (rather than a pair), which separates the left and right supratemporal and tabular bones at the rear edge of the skull. Lone postparietals are rare among non-amniote tetrapods and tetrapod relatives; only Ichthyostega and diadectomorphs are known to possess them. The discovery of Deltaherpeton prompted a review and re-augmentation of the defining characteristics for the family Colosteidae, though it did not help to clarify the relationship between colosteids and other early tetrapods.\nThough it is believed that Deltaherpeton is more derived, the species is thought to have shared its environment with other early four-limbed vertebrates such as Whatcheeria, approximately 339.4 to 336 million years ago.\n\n\n== References ==\nAcanthostega (meaning \"spiny roof\") is an extinct genus of stem-tetrapod, among the first vertebrate animals to have recognizable limbs. It appeared in the late Devonian period (Famennian age) about 365 million years ago, and was anatomically intermediate between lobe-finned fishes and those that were fully capable of coming onto land.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\n \nThe fossilized remains are generally well preserved, with the famous fossil by which the significance of this species  was discovered being found by Jennifer A. Clack in East Greenland in 1987, though fragments of the skull had been discovered in 1933 by Gunnar Säve-Söderbergh and Erik Jarvik.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe 60 cm (24 in) Acanthostega had eight digits on each hand (the number of digits on the feet is unclear) linked by webbing, it lacked wrists, and was generally poorly adapted for walking on land. It also had a remarkably fish-like shoulder and forelimb. The front limbs of Acanthostega could not bend forward at the elbow, and  therefore could not be brought into a weight bearing position, appearing to be more suitable for paddling or for holding on to aquatic plants. Acanthostega is the earliest stem-tetrapod to show the shift in locomotory dominance from the pectoral girdle to the pelvic girdle.\nThere are many morphological changes that allowed the pelvic girdle of Acanthostega to become a weight-bearing structure. In more ancestral states the two sides of the girdle were not attached. In Acanthostega there is contact between the two sides and fusion of the girdle with the sacral rib of the vertebral column. These fusions would have made the pelvic region more powerful and equipped to counter the force of gravity when not supported by the buoyancy of an aquatic environment. It had internal gills that were covered like those of fish. It also had lungs, but its ribs were too short to support its chest cavity out of water.\n\n\n== Classification ==\n\nAcanthostega is seen as part of widespread evolutionary radiation in the late Devonian period, starting with purely aquatic finned tetrapodomorphs, with their successors showing increased air-breathing capability and related adaptions to the jaws and gills, as well as more muscular neck allowing freer movement of the head than fish have, and use of the fins to raise the body of the fish. These features are displayed by the earlier Tiktaalik, which like Ichthyostega showed signs of greater abilities to move around on land, but is thought to have been primarily aquatic.\nIn Late Devonian vertebrate speciation, descendants of pelagic lobe-finned fish –like Eusthenopteron– exhibited a sequence of adaptations: Panderichthys, suited to muddy shallows; Tiktaalik with limb-like fins that could take it onto land; stem-tetrapods in weed-filled swamps, such as Acanthostega, which had eight-digited feet; and Ichthyostega, with full limbs. Their descendants also included pelagic lobe-finned fish such as coelacanth species.\n\n\n== Paleobiology ==\n\n\n=== Hunting strategy ===\n\nIt has been inferred that Acanthostega probably lived in shallow, weed-choked swamps, its legs apparently being adapted for these specific ecosystems. Apart from the presence of limbs, it was not adapted in any way for walking on land. Jennifer A. Clack interprets this as showing that Acanthostega was primarily an aquatic animal descended from fish that never left the sea, and that the specializations of the tetrapod lineage were exaptations: features which would later be useful for terrestrial life, even if they originated for a different purpose. At that period, deciduous plants were flourishing and annually shedding leaves into the water, attracting small prey into warm oxygen-poor shallows that were difficult for larger fish to swim in; Clack remarks on how the lower jaw of Acanthostega shows a change from those of fish that have two rows of teeth, with a large number of small teeth in the outer row, and two large fangs and some smaller teeth in the inner row. This di\nRomer's gap is an apparent gap in the Paleozoic tetrapod fossil record used in the study of evolutionary biology, which represent periods from which excavators have not yet found relevant fossils. It is named after American paleontologist Alfred Romer, who first recognised it in 1956. Recent discoveries in Scotland are beginning to close this gap in palaeontological knowledge.\n\n\n== Age ==\nRomer's gap runs from approximately 360 to 345 million years ago, corresponding to the first 15 million years of the Carboniferous, the early Mississippian (starting with the Tournaisian and moving into the Visean). The gap forms a discontinuity between the primitive forests and high diversity of fishes in the end Devonian and more modern aquatic and terrestrial assemblages of the early Carboniferous.\n\n\n== Mechanism behind the gap ==\nThere has been long debate as to why there are so few fossils from this time period. Some have suggested the problem was of fossilization itself, suggesting that there may have been differences in the geochemistry of the time that did not favour fossil formation. Also, excavators simply may not have dug in the right places. The existence of a true low point in vertebrate diversity has been supported by independent lines of evidence, however recent finds in five new locations in Scotland have yielded multiple fossils of early tetrapods and amphibians. They have also allowed the most accurate logging of the geology of this period. This new evidence suggests that - at least locally - there was no gap in diversity or changes in oxygen geochemistry.\nWhile initial arthropod terrestriality was well under way before the gap, and some digited tetrapods might have come on land, there are remarkably few terrestrial or aquatic fossils that date from the gap itself. Recent work on Paleozoic geochemistry has provided evidence for the biological reality of Romer's gap in both terrestrial vertebrates and arthropods, and has correlated it with a period of unusually low atmospheric oxygen concentration, which was determined from the idiosyncratic geochemistry of rocks formed during Romer's gap. The new sedimentary logging in the Ballagan Formation in Scotland challenges this, suggesting oxygen was stable throughout Romer's Gap.\nAquatic vertebrates, which include most tetrapods during the Carboniferous, were recovering from the Hangenberg event, a major extinction event that preceded Romer's gap, one on par with that which killed the dinosaurs. In this end-Devonian extinction, most marine and freshwater groups became extinct or were reduced to a few lineages, although the precise mechanism of the extinction is unclear. Before the event, oceans and lakes were dominated by lobe-finned fishes and armored fishes called placoderms. After the gap, modern ray finned fish, as well as sharks and their relatives were the dominant forms. The period also saw the demise of the Ichthyostegalia, the early fish-like amphibians with more than five digits.\nThe low diversity of marine fishes, particularly shell-crushing predators (durophages), at the beginning of Romer's gap is supported by the sudden abundance of hard-shelled crinoid echinoderms during the same period. The Tournaisian has even been called the \"Age of Crinoids\". Once the number of shell-crushing ray-finned fishes and sharks increased later in the Carboniferous, coincident with the end of Romer's gap, the diversity of crinoids with Devonian-type armor plummeted, following the pattern of a classic predator-prey (Lotka-Volterra) cycle. There is increasing evidence that lungfish and stem tetrapods and amphibians recovered quickly and diversified in the rapidly changing environment of the end-Devonian and Romer's Gap.\n\n\n== Gap fauna ==\n\nThe gap in the tetrapod record has been progressively closed with the discoveries of such early Carboniferous tetrapods as Pederpes and Crassigyrinus. There are a few sites where vertebrate fossils have been found to help fill in the gap, such as the East \nIchthyostega (from Greek: ἰχθῦς ikhthûs, 'fish' and Greek: στέγη stégē, 'roof') is an extinct genus of limbed tetrapodomorphs from the Late Devonian of what is now Greenland. It was among the earliest four-limbed vertebrates ever in the fossil record and was one of the first with weight-bearing adaptations for terrestrial locomotion. Ichthyostega possessed lungs and limbs that helped it navigate through shallow water in swamps. Although Ichthyostega is often labelled a 'tetrapod' because of its limbs and fingers, it evolved long before true crown group tetrapods and could more accurately be referred to as a stegocephalian or stem tetrapod. Likewise, while undoubtedly of amphibian build and habit, it is not a true member of the group in the narrow sense, as the first modern amphibians (members of the group Lissamphibia) appeared in the Triassic Period. Until finds of other early stegocephalians and closely related fishes in the late 20th century, Ichthyostega stood alone as a transitional fossil between fish and tetrapods, combining fish and tetrapod features. Newer research has shown that it had an unusual anatomy, functioning more akin to a seal than a salamander, as previously assumed.\n\n\n== History ==\n \nIn 1932 Gunnar Säve-Söderbergh described four Ichthyostega species from the Late Devonian of East Greenland and one species belonging to the genus Ichthyostegopsis, I. wimani. These species could be synonymous (in which case only I. stensioei would remain), because their morphological differences are not very pronounced. The species differ in skull proportions, skull punctuation and skull bone patterns. The comparisons were done on 14 specimens collected in 1931 by the Danish East Greenland Expedition. Additional specimens were collected between 1933 and 1955.\n\n\n== Description ==\nIchthyostega was a fairly large animal for its time, as it was broadly built and about 1.5 m (4.9 ft) long. The skull was low, with dorsally placed eyes and large labyrinthodont teeth. The posterior margin of the skull formed an operculum covering the gills. The spiracle was situated in an otic notch behind each eye. Computed tomography has revealed that Ichthyostega had a specialized ear, including a stapes with a unique morphology compared to other tetrapods or to any fish hyomandibula. \n\n\n=== Postcranial skeleton ===\nThe legs were large compared to contemporary relatives. It had seven digits on each hind leg, along with a peculiar, poorly ossified mass which lies anteriorly adjacent to the digits. The exact number of digits on the forelimb is not yet known, since fossils of the hand have not been found. While in water, the foot would have functioned like a fleshy paddle more than a fin.The vertebral column and ribcage of Ichthyostega was unusual and highly specialized relative to both its contemporaries and later tetrapods. The thoracic vertebrae at the front of the trunk and the short neck have tall neural spines that lean backwards. They attach to pointed ribs which increase in size and acquire prominent overlapping flanges. Past the sixth or seventh flanged rib, the ribs abruptly decrease in size and lose their flanges. The lumbar vertebrae at the back of the trunk have strong muscle scars and neural spines which are bent forwards and decrease in size towards the hips. The sacral vertebrae above the hips have fan-shaped neural spines that transition from forward-leaning to backward-leaning as they approach the tail. The vertebrae right behind the hips have unusually large ribs similar to those of the thoracic region. The caudal vertebrae have slender spines that lean backwards. The tail of Ichthyostega retained a low fin supported by bony lepidotrichia (fin rays). The tail fin was not as deep as in Acanthostega, and would have been less useful for swimming.\n\nIchthyostega is related to Acanthostega gunnari, which is also from what is now East Greenland. Ichthyostega's skull seems more fish-like than that of Acanthostega, but its pelvic girdle mo\nTetrapodomorpha (also known as Choanata) is a clade of vertebrates consisting of tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) and their closest sarcopterygian relatives that are more closely related to living tetrapods than to living lungfish. Advanced forms transitional between fish and the early labyrinthodonts, such as Tiktaalik, have been referred to as \"fishapods\" by their discoverers, being half-fish, half-tetrapods, in appearance and limb morphology. The Tetrapodomorpha contains the crown group tetrapods (the last common ancestor of living tetrapods and all of its descendants) and several groups of early stem tetrapods, which includes several groups of related lobe-finned fishes, collectively known as the osteolepiforms. The Tetrapodomorpha minus the crown group Tetrapoda are the stem Tetrapoda, a paraphyletic unit encompassing the fish to tetrapod transition.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nAmong the characteristics defining tetrapodomorphs are modifications to the fins, notably a humerus with convex head articulating with the glenoid fossa (the socket of the shoulder joint). Another key trait is the internal nostril or choana. Most fish have two pairs of nostrils, one on either side of the head for incoming water (incurrent nostrils) and another pair for outgoing water (excurrent nostrils). In early tetrapodomorphs like Kenichthys, the excurrent nostrils had shifted towards the mouth's perimeter. In later tetrapodomorphs, including tetrapods, the excurrent nostril is positioned inside the mouth, where it is known as the choana. The nearly-equivalent clade Choanata often refers to these later forms specifically.\n\n\n== History ==\nTetrapodomorph fossils are known from the early Devonian onwards, and include Osteolepis, Panderichthys, Kenichthys and Tungsenia. Tetrapodomorpha evolved from ancient lobe-finned fish (sarcopterygians) around 390 million years ago in the Middle Devonian period.\n\n\n== Classification ==\n\n\n=== Taxonomy ===\nAfter Benton, 2004; and Swartz, 2012.\n\nSubclass Sarcopterygii\nInfraclass Tetrapodomorpha\nOrder †Rhizodontida\nFamily †Sauripteridae\nFamily †Rhizodontidae\nSuperorder †Osteolepidida (or Osteolepiformes)\nFamily †Canowindridae\nFamily †Thysanolepidae\nFamily †Tristichopteridae\nOrder †Osteolepiformes (or Megalichthyiformes)\nFamily †Osteolepidae\nFamily †Megalichthyidae\nClade Eotetrapodiformes\nClade Elpistostegalia (or Panderichthyida)\nClade Stegocephalia\nFamily †Elpistostegidae\nFamily †Whatcheeriidae\nFamily †Colosteidae\nSuperfamily †Baphetoidea\nSuperclass Tetrapoda\nOther clades include the Eotetrapodiformes (Tinirau, Platycephalichthys, the Tristichopteridae and Elpistostegalia).

It belonged to Rhizodontida, one of the earliest-diverging tetrapodomorph clades. Two valid species have been described, both of which lived during the Early Carboniferous epoch. The type species R. hibberti is known from the Viséan stage of the United Kingdom, whereas the species R. serpukhovensis is from the Serpukhovian of Russia. Some fossils referred to the genus Rhizodus have also been found in North America.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe most notable characteristics of Rhizodus, compared to other giant rhizodonts such as Barameda, were the two 22-centimetre (8.7 in) fangs located near the front of its jaws, followed by other teeth scaling downwards in size. Rhizodus was a giant apex predator that resided in freshwater lakes, river systems and large swamps, with R. hibberti measuring 5.14–5.63 metres (16.9–18.5 ft) long and weighing 1–1.5 metric tons (1.1–1.7 short tons). It fed on small to medium-sized amphibians, using its teeth to kill prey and rip it into digestible sizes, rather than swallowing prey whole like other, smaller-toothed sarcopterygians.\nFossil skin imprints show that Rhizodus had large, plate-like scales, similar to those found on modern day arapaima.\n\n\n== Diet ==\nThe diet of Rhizodus' included medium-sized fish and tetrapods. It has been proposed that Rhizodus lunged at terrestrial, shorebound prey, just like a modern-day crocodile.\n\n\n== References ==\nThis list of prehistoric amphibians is an attempt to create a comprehensive listing of all genera from the fossil record that have ever been considered to be amphibians, excluding purely vernacular terms.

Modern forms are excluded from this list. The list currently includes 457 names.\n\n\n== Naming conventions and terminology ==\nNaming conventions and terminology follow the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Technical terms used include:\n\nJunior synonym: A name which describes the same taxon as a previously published name. If two or more genera are formally designated and the type specimens are later assigned to the same genus, the first to be published (in chronological order) is the senior synonym, and all other instances are junior synonyms. Senior synonyms are generally used, except by special decision of the ICZN, but junior synonyms cannot be used again, even if deprecated. Junior synonymy is often subjective, unless the genera described were both based on the same type specimen.\nNomen nudum (Latin for \"naked name\"): A name that has appeared in print but has not yet been formally published by the standards of the ICZN. Nomina nuda (the plural form) are invalid, and are therefore not italicized as a proper generic name would be. If the name is later formally published, that name is no longer a nomen nudum and will be italicized on this list. Often, the formally published name will differ from any nomina nuda that describe the same specimen.\nNomen oblitum (Latin for \"forgotten name\"): A name that has not been used in the scientific community for more than fifty years after its original proposal.\nPreoccupied name: A name that is formally published, but which has already been used for another taxon.

Panderichthys, which was recovered from Frasnian (early Late Devonian) deposits in Latvia, is represented by two species. P. stolbovi is known only from some snout fragments and an incomplete lower jaw. P. rhombolepis is known from several more complete specimens. Although it probably belongs to a sister group of the earliest tetrapods, Panderichthys exhibits a range of features transitional between tristichopterid lobe-fin fishes (e.g., Eusthenopteron) and early tetrapods. It is named after the German-Baltic paleontologist Christian Heinrich Pander. Possible tetrapod tracks dating back to before the appearance of Panderichthys in the fossil record were reported in 2010, which suggests that Panderichthys is not a direct ancestor of tetrapods, but nonetheless shows the traits that evolved during the fish-tetrapod evolution \n\n\n== Discovery and history ==\nPanderichthys is represented by two different species: Panderichthys rhombolepis and Panderichthys stobolvi. P. rhombolepis was discovered by Gross in 1930 and P. stobolvi was discovered and figured by Emilia Vorobyeva in 1960. P. rhombolepis was discovered in Lode, Latvia within Frasnian deposits and according to P.E. Ahlberg can definitely be found in other Frasnian deposits in Latvia. Although fossils of Panderichthys have been known for a long time, they have only recently been examined in full. The first time they were recognized as being phylogenetically closer to tetrapods than fish was by Shultze and Arsenault in 1985.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nPanderichthys is a 1.5–2 m (4 ft 11 in – 6 ft 7 in) long fish with a large tetrapod-like head that is flattened, narrow at the snout and wide in the back. The intracranial joint, which is characteristic of most lobe-fin fishes, has been lost from the external elements of the skull, but is still present in the braincase. The patterns of external bones in the skull roof and cheeks are more similar to those of early tetrapods than those of other lobe-fins. The transitional qualities of Panderichthys are also evident in the rest of the body. It lacks the dorsal and anal fins (fish fin) and its tail is more like those of early tetrapods than the caudal fins of other lobe-fins. The shoulders exhibit several tetrapod-like features, while the humerus is longer than those found in other lobe-fins. The vertebral column is ossified throughout its length and the vertebrae are comparable to those of early tetrapods. On the other hand, the distal parts of the front fins are unlike those of tetrapods. As would be expected from a fin, there are numerous lepidotrichia (long and thin fin rays).\nPanderichthys has many features that can be considered an intermediate form during the fish-tetrapod evolution and displays some features that are more derived than its phylogenetic position indicates, while others that are more basal. The body form of Panderichthys and Tiktaalik represents a major step in the transition from fish to tetrapods and they were even able to haul out on land. According to Shultze and Trueb, Panderichthys shares ten features with tetrapods:\n\nThe skull roof is flat compared to fish skulls.\nThe orbits are more dorsal and lie closer together.\nThe external naris is close to the margin of the upper jaw.\nFrontals are paired.\nThere is no external intracranial joint.\nThe parietal bone is located between the orbits and main portion posterior to orbits.\nIn  P. rhombolepis, the squamosal touches the maxilla (varies among specimens though).\nThe teeth have a complex polyplocodont structure.\nA lack of median fins.\nIn panderichthyids and Ichthyostega, the ribs are attached to the neural arch and there is an intercentrum.\n\n\n=== Humerus ===\nOne of the key transitional features of Panderichthys is its humerus. During the transition from fish to tetrapods the limbs began to move and became located at a right angle to the body rather than be\nTemnospondyli (from Greek τέμνειν, temnein 'to cut' and σπόνδυλος, spondylos 'vertebra') or temnospondyls is a diverse ancient order of small to giant tetrapods—often considered primitive amphibians—that flourished worldwide during the Carboniferous, Permian and Triassic periods, with fossils being found on every continent. A few species continued into the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous periods, but all had gone extinct by the Late Cretaceous. During about 210 million years of evolutionary history, they adapted to a wide range of habitats, including freshwater, terrestrial, and even coastal marine environments. Their life history is well understood, with fossils known from the larval stage, metamorphosis and maturity. Most temnospondyls were semiaquatic, although some were almost fully terrestrial, returning to the water only to breed. These temnospondyls were some of the first vertebrates fully adapted to life on land. Although temnospondyls are amphibians, many had characteristics such as scales and large armour-like bony plates (osteoderms) that generally distinguish them from the modern soft-bodied lissamphibians (frogs and toads, newts, salamanders and caecilians).\nTemnospondyls have been known since the early 19th century, and were initially thought to be reptiles. They were described at various times as batrachians, stegocephalians and labyrinthodonts, although these names are now rarely used. Animals now grouped in Temnospondyli were spread out among several amphibian groups until the early 20th century, when they were found to belong to a distinct taxon based on the structure of their vertebrae. Temnospondyli means \"cut vertebrae\", as each vertebra is divided into several parts (intercentrum, paired pleurocentra, neural arch), although this occurs widely among other early tetrapods.\nExperts disagree over whether temnospondyls were ancestral to modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians), or whether the whole group died out without leaving any descendants. Different hypotheses have placed modern amphibians as the descendants of temnospondyls, as descendants of another group of early tetrapods called lepospondyls, or even as descendants of both groups (with caecilians evolving from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders evolving from temnospondyls). There is further disagreement about a temnospondyl origin of lissamphibians related to whether the modern groups arose from only one group (dissorophoids) or from two different groups (dissorophoids and stereospondyls). The majority of studies place a group of temnospondyls called amphibamiforms as the closest relatives of modern amphibians. Similarities in teeth, skulls and hearing structures link the two groups. Whether temnospondyls are considered part of the tetrapod crown or stem thus depends on their inferred relationship to lissamphibians.\n\n\n== Definitions ==\n\n\n=== Branch-based definition ===\nIn 2000, Adam Yates and Anne Warren defined the name Temnospondyli as applying to the clade encompassing all organisms that are more closely related to Eryops than to the “microsaur” Pantylus. By this definition, if lissamphibians are temnospondyls and Pantylus is a reptiliomorph, the name Temnospondyli is synonymous with Batrachomorpha (a clade containing all organisms that are more closely related to modern amphibians than to mammals and reptiles).\n\n\n=== Node-based definition ===\nRainer Schoch in 2013 defined the name Temnospondyli as applying to “[t]he least inclusive clade containing Edops craigi and Mastodonsaurus giganteus”.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nMany temnospondyls are much larger than living amphibians, and superficially resemble crocodiles, which has led many taxa to be named with the suffix -suchus. The largest taxa, which were predominantly the Mesozoic stereospondyls, had skulls exceeding one meter in length, and the entire animal would have been several meters in length (for reference, the largest living amphibian, Andrias, is about 1.8 meters in body length).\nCrassigyrinus (from Latin: crassus, 'thick' and Greek: γυρίνος Greek: gyrínos, 'tadpole') is an extinct genus of carnivorous stem tetrapod from the Early Carboniferous Limestone Coal Group of Scotland and possibly Greer, West Virginia. \n\n\n== Discovery ==\nThe type specimen was originally described as Macromerium scoticum and lacked a complete skull. With subsequent discoveries, Crassigyrinus is now known from three skulls, one of which is in articulation with a fairly complete skeleton, and two incomplete lower jaws. Crassigyrinus grew up to 2 meters in length, coupled with tiny limbs and unusually large jaws. Crassigyrinus is taxonomically enigmatic, having confused paleontologists for decades with its apparent fish-like and tetrapod features. It was traditionally placed within the group Labyrinthodontia along with many other early tetrapods. Some paleontologists have even considered it as the most basal crown group tetrapod, while others hesitate to even place it within the Tetrapoda superclass.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nCrassigyrinus had a streamlined body up to 2 meters in length. Its limbs were tiny and virtually useless, implying that the animal was almost completely aquatic. Crassigyrinus had unusually large jaws, equipped with two rows of sharp teeth, the second row having a pair of palatal fangs. Studies have shown that Crassigyrinus may have been able to open its mouth as wide as 60 degrees, which suggests that it was a powerful predator with a strong bite. This strongly suggests that it was ideally suited for catching fish, and the animal was probably a fast-moving predator.\n\nSeveral thickened bony ridges ran along the dorsal midline of the snout and between the eyes, and several paleontologists have suggested that they helped the skull to withstand stress when the animal bit prey. Crassigyrinus had large eyes, suggesting that it was either nocturnal, or lived in very murky water. It possessed large otic (spiracular) notches, probably accommodating a spiracle rather than a tympanic membrane.\nIts peculiar stunted forelimbs were tiny and the humerus was only 35 mm long (the whole animal was about 1.5 m long). Various foramina on the humeral surfaces are very similar to those seen in Ichthyostega, Acanthostega, and lobe-finned fishes like Eusthenopteron. The hindlimbs were much larger than the forelimbs, and in the pelvis the ilium lacked a bony connection to the vertebral column (a classic feature of aquatic tetrapods). Although there is evidence that the Crassigyrinus eventually lost its limbs, there is counterevidence in that it used its limbs for movement, as proven by healing in the bones in case of injury. The fact that there is a need to heal the limbs must mean there was an importance of the limbs at some point, and was then lost. The tail, only known from a few vertebrae fragments, is assumed to have been long and laterally compressed.\nA crushed skull from the Dora bonebed near Cowdenbeath was described by Panchen (1985). The skull was redescribed by Porro et al. (2023), based on a digital reconstruction derived from CT scans. The 1985 reconstruction of the skull was much taller and narrower than in most early tetrapods, though the 2023 reconstruction is relatively low and broad.\n\n\n== Paleobiology ==\nCrassygyrinus was an aquatic predator. It was capable of opening its jaws widely at a 60-degree angle, with a powerful bite with rapid jaw closure, allowing it to grasp and consume relatively large prey items.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCrassigyrinus\nTiktaalik (; Inuktitut ᑎᒃᑖᓕᒃ [tiktaːlik]) is a monospecific genus of extinct sarcopterygian (lobe-finned fish) from the Late Devonian Period, about 375 Mya (million years ago), having many features akin to those of tetrapods (four-legged animals). Tiktaalik is estimated to have had a total length of 1.25–2.75 metres (4.1–9.0 ft) based on various specimens.\nUnearthed in Arctic Canada, Tiktaalik is a non-tetrapod member of Osteichthyes (bony fish), complete with scales and gills—but it has a triangular, flattened head and unusual, cleaver-shaped fins. Its fins have thin ray bones for paddling like most fish, but they also have sturdy interior bones that would have allowed Tiktaalik to prop itself up in shallow water and use its limbs for support as most four-legged animals do. Those fins and other mixed characteristics mark Tiktaalik as a crucial transition fossil, a link in evolution from swimming fish to four-legged vertebrates. This and similar animals might be the common ancestors of all vertebrate terrestrial fauna: amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals.\nThe first Tiktaalik fossils were found in 2004 on Ellesmere Island in Nunavut, Canada. The discovery, made by Edward B. Daeschler of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Neil H. Shubin from the University of Chicago, and Harvard University Professor Farish A. Jenkins Jr., was published in the April 6, 2006 issue of Nature and quickly recognized as a transitional form.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\n\nIn 2004, three fossilized Tiktaalik skeletons were discovered in the Late Devonian fluvial Fram Formation on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, in northern Canada. Estimated ages were reported at 375 Ma, 379 Ma and 383 Ma. At the time of the species' existence, Ellesmere Island was part of the continent Laurentia (modern eastern North America and Greenland), which was centered on the equator and had a warm climate. When discovered, one of the skulls was found sticking out of a cliff. Upon further inspection, the fossil was found to be in excellent condition for a 375-million-year-old specimen.\nThe discovery by Daeschler, Shubin and Jenkins was published in the April 6, 2006 issue of Nature and quickly recognized as a transitional form. Jennifer A. Clack, a Cambridge University expert on tetrapod evolution, said of Tiktaalik, \"It's one of those things you can point to and say, 'I told you this would exist,' and there it is.\" \n\n \nAfter five years of digging on Ellesmere Island, in the far north of Nunavut, they hit pay dirt: a collection of several fish so beautifully preserved that their skeletons were still intact. As Shubin's team studied the species they saw to their excitement that it was exactly the missing intermediate they were looking for. 'We found something that really split the difference right down the middle,' says Daeschler.\nTiktaalik is an Inuktitut word meaning \"large freshwater fish\". The \"fishapod\" genus received this name after a suggestion by Inuit elders of Canada's Nunavut Territory, where the fossil was discovered. The specific name roseae honours an anonymous donor. Taking a detailed look at the internal head skeleton of Tiktaalik roseae, in the October 16, 2008, issue of Nature, researchers show how Tiktaalik was gaining structures that could allow it to support itself on solid ground and breathe air, a key intermediate step in the transformation of the skull that accompanied the shift to life on land by our distant ancestors. More than 60 specimens of Tiktaalik have been discovered, though the holotype remains the most complete and well-described fossil.\n\n\n== Description ==\nTiktaalik provides insights on the features of the extinct closest relatives of the tetrapods. Tiktaalik was a large fish: the largest known fossils have an estimated length of 2.75 m (9.02 feet), with the longest lower jaws reaching a length of 31 centimetres (1.0 ft).\n\n\n=== Skull and neck ===\n The skull of Tiktaalik was low and flat, more similar in shape to that of a crocodile than most fish. The rear ed\nThe Batrachomorpha (\"frog forms\") are a clade containing extant and extinct amphibians that are more closely related to modern amphibians than they are to mammals and reptiles (including birds). According to many analyses they include the extinct Temnospondyli; some show that they include the Lepospondyli instead. The name traditionally indicated a more limited group.\nThe first tetrapods were all amphibians in the physiological sense that they laid their eggs in water, and are colloquially sometimes referred to as labyrinthodonts or stegocephalians. The term \"amphibians\" can be ambiguous, however. In modern phylogeny, the basalmost tetrapods are discerned from two derived branches, one consisting of the crown group of modern amphibians, the Lissamphibia, and its relatives. In this scheme, the name Batrachomorpha is given to this branch of amphibians, while the name Reptiliomorpha denotes the other branch. While the actual phylogeny of the modern amphibians is not well understood, their ancestors are descended from one line of batrachomorphs. All other living tetrapods (reptiles, birds and mammals) are descended from one branch of reptiliomorphs, the amniotes. Amniotes achieved dominance, while all other reptiliomorphs and most batrachomorphs have gone extinct.\n\n\n== Classification ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe name Batrachomorpha was coined by the Swedish palaeontologist Gunnar Säve-Söderbergh in 1934 to refer to ichthyostegids, temnospondyls, anthracosaurs, and the frogs. Säve-Söderbergh held the view that salamanders and caecilians are not related to the other tetrapods, but had developed independently from a different group of lobe-finned fish, the porolepiformes. In this view amphibians would be a biphyletic group, and Batrachomorpha was erected to form a natural group consisting of the \"true amphibians\" (i.e. frogs in Säve-Söderberghs view) and their fossil relatives. The salamanders and the Lepospondyli was consigned to \"Urodelomorpha\".\nFriedrich von Huene adopted it as a superorder of his subclass \"Eutetrapoda\" (the lower tetrapods exclusive of the urodeles) and included the orders Stegocephalia (here including a number of Labyrinthodonts) and Anura. Erik Jarvik, who took over Säve-Söderberghs work and shared his view of the origin of salamanders, used the term more informally, but in a wider sense, to include the ancestral osteolepiform fishes.\nThough never a majority view, the notion that tetrapods had evolved twice, together with the usage of the term batrachomorpha, lingered until genetic analysis started confirming the monophyly of living amphibians in the 1990s. Jarviks classification is no longer followed, all living amphibians and their fossil relatives now being classified together in the group Lissamphibia.\n\n\n=== Phylogenetics ===\n\nMichael Benton adopted the term Batrachomorpha to include all living amphibians and extinct relatives more closely related to amphibians than to amniotes. In his scheme, Batrachomorpha is a superorder of amphibious tetrapods containing the following subgroups:\n\nSuperorder Batrachomorpha\n†Order Edopoidea\n†Family Dendrerpetonidae\nOrder unnamed\n†Suborder Dvinosauria\n†Family Branchiosauridae\n†Family Dissorophidae\nInfraclass Lissamphibia\n†Family Albanerpetonidae\nOrder Gymnophiona (extant )\nOrder Urodela (extant )\nOrder Anura (extant )\n†Order unnamed\n†Family †Eryopidae\n†Family Actinodontidae\n†Family Archegosauridae\n†Family Rhinesuchidae\n†Suborder Capitosauria\n†Suborder Trematosauria\n†Family Trematosauridae\n†Family Metoposauridae\n†Family Plagiosauridae\n†Family Rhytidosteidae\n†Family Brachyopidae\n†Family Chigutisauridae\nThe other groups of tetrapods considered more closely related to amniotes are put in the superorder Reptiliomorpha.\nThe phylogenetic relationships of Paleozoic tetrapods have not yet been worked out with certainty, and the validity of Batrachomorpha as a clade depends on where other amphibians and early amniotes fit on the evolutionary tree. The actual content of Batrachomorpha \nCasineria  is an extinct genus of tetrapodomorph which lived about 340–334 million years ago in the Mississippian epoch of the Carboniferous period. Its generic name, Casineria, is a latinization of Cheese Bay, the site near Edinburgh, Scotland, where the holotype fossil was found. When originally described in 1999, it was identified as a transitional fossil noted for its mix of basal (amphibian-like) and advanced (reptile-like) characteristics, putting it at or very near the origin of the amniotes, the group containing all mammals, birds, modern reptiles, and other descendants of their reptile-like common ancestor. However, the sole known fossil is lacking key elements such as a skull, making exact analysis difficult. As a result, the classification of Casineria has been more controversial in analyses conducted since 1999. Other proposed affinities include a placement among the lepospondyls, seymouriamorphs, \"gephyrostegids\", or as a synonym of Caerorhachis, another controversial tetrapod which may have been an early temnospondyl.\n\n\n== Description ==\n \nCasineria was a small animal with a postcrania length estimated to have been 15 centimeters. Its small size would have made it ideal for hunting the invertebrates of the Carboniferous.\nCasineria had five fingers, with the bones at the finger tip being tapering and curved. This spurred the initial describers to argue that it was the oldest known animal with claws on each hand, and marks the earliest clawed foot. Claws are extremely rare among amphibians, but ubiquitous among amniotes, so their supposed presence in Casineria has been considered to be evidence towards its amniote identity. Claws are also a feature intimately bound to the formation of keratinous scales in reptiles, so in life, Casineria would  have borne scaly, reptilian-type skin, and would have resembled a small lizard (despite being only distantly related to true lizards).\nUnder the hypothesis that it was among the first amniotes in the biological sense, it would have laid an amniotic egg not dependent on being laid in water to survive, possibly hiding them in damp vegetation or hollowed out tree stumps. This has been inferred from the fact that Casineria was found in rocks showing a rather dry environment. In the early Carboniferous period before the appearance of Casineria, vertebrates were primarily aquatic, only spending part of their time on land. Casineria was believed to be among the first vertebrates to live and reproduce on land.\nHowever, later studies have not consistently placed Casineria as an early amniote. Even the presence of claws has been considered doubtful, as Marjanovic & Laurin (2019) noted that the finger tips were squared-off, rather than pointed.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\n\nIn 1992, an amateur fossil collector spotted the remnants of this four-legged creature on the shore of Cheese Bay, Scotland. For the next five years, the fossil languished at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh while researchers focused on other projects. Consisting of a slab and counterslab (compression fossil) of a single partial skeleton, the fossil was cataloged with the specimen designation NMS G.1993.54.1. Around 1997, work began to expose the remainder of the fossil from the surrounding matrix. The work revealed that the animal probably lived in an environment much drier than previously understood. The findings were first reported in the April 8, 1999 edition of Nature.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nWhile retaining a general build like those found in the amphibian reptiliomorph groups like Seymouriamorpha and Diadectomorpha, Casineria also shows features that tie it in with early reptiles, notably a generally gracile build with light leg bones, unfused ankles and toes terminating in claws. This would enable the animal to use their feet actively in traction, rather than as holdfasts, an indication of a primarily terrestrial lifestyle. These traits have been argued to show that it was more closely related to amniotes tha\nLepospondyli is a diverse taxon of early tetrapods. With the exception of one late-surviving lepospondyl from the Late Permian of Morocco (Diplocaulus minimus), lepospondyls lived from the Visean stage of the Early Carboniferous to the Early Permian and were geographically restricted to what is now Europe and North America. Five major groups of lepospondyls are known: Adelospondyli; Aïstopoda; Lysorophia; Microsauria; and Nectridea. Lepospondyls have a diverse range of body forms and include species with newt-like, eel- or snake-like, and lizard-like forms. Various species were aquatic, semiaquatic, or terrestrial. None were large (the biggest genus, the diplocaulid Diplocaulus, reached a meter in length, but most were much smaller), and they are assumed to have lived in specialized ecological niches not taken by the more numerous temnospondyl amphibians that coexisted with them in the Paleozoic. \nLepospondyli was named in 1888 by Karl Alfred von Zittel, who coined the name to include some tetrapods from the Paleozoic that shared some specific characteristics in the notochord and teeth. Lepospondyls have sometimes been considered to be either related or ancestral to modern amphibians or to Amniota (the clade containing reptiles and mammals). It has been suggested that the grouping is polyphyletic, with aïstopods being primitive stem-tetrapods, while recumbirostran microsaurs are primitive reptiles.\n\n\n== Description ==\nAll lepospondyls are characterised by having simple, spool-shaped vertebrae that did not ossify from cartilage, but rather grew as bony cylinders around the notochord. In addition, the upper portion of the vertebra, the neural arch, is usually fused to the centrum (the main body of the vertebra).\n\n\n== Classification ==\nThe position of the Lepospondyli within the Tetrapoda is uncertain because the earliest lepospondyls were already highly specialized when they first appeared in the fossil record. Some lepospondyls were once thought to be related or perhaps ancestral to modern salamanders (Urodela), but not the other modern amphibians. This view is no longer held and all modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians) are now grouped within the clade Lissamphibia. For a long time, the Lepospondyli were considered one of the three subclasses of Amphibia, along with the Lissamphibia and the Labyrinthodontia. However, the dissolution of \"labyrinthodonts\" into separate groups such as temnospondyls and anthracosaurs has cast doubt on these traditional amphibian subclasses.  Much like \"Labyrinthodontia\", some studies proposed that Lepospondyli is an artificial (polyphyletic) grouping with some members closely related to extinct stem tetrapod groups and others more closely related to modern amphibians or reptiles. Early phylogenetic analyses conducted in the 1980s and 1990s often maintained the idea that lepospondyls were paraphyletic, with nectrideans close to colosteids and microsaurs close to temnospondyls, which were considered to be ancestral to modern amphibians.\nHowever, a 1995 paper by Robert Carroll argued that lepospondyls were actually a monophyletic group closer to reptiles. Carroll considered them closer to reptiles than the seymouriamorphs, but not as close as the diadectomorphs. Many phylogenetic analyses since Carroll (1995) agreed with his interpretation, including Laurin & Reisz (1997),  Anderson (2001), and Ruta et al. (2003). A few have still considered lepospondyls ancestral to amphibians, but came to this conclusion without changing the position of lepospondyls compared to seymouriamorphs and diadectomorphs.\nLepospondyl and tetrapod classification is still controversial, and even recent studies have had doubts about lepospondyl monophyly. For example, a 2007 paper has suggested that adelospondyls are stem-tetrapods close to colosteids and a 2017 paper on Lethiscus has  Aïstopoda in the tetrapod stem based on their primitive braincase. These studies differ in the internal and external relations\nAnthracosaurus is an extinct genus of embolomere that lived during the Late Carboniferous (around 315 million years ago) in what is now Scotland, England, and Ohio. Measuring around 10 ft (3.0 m) long, it was a large, aquatic eel-like predator. It has a robust skull about 40 centimetres (1.3 ft) in length with large teeth in the jaws and on the roof of the mouth. Anthracosaurus probably inhabited swamps, rivers and lakes. Its name is Greek for \"coal lizard\".\n\n\n== Discovery and specimens ==\n\n\n=== Scotland ===\nThe genus and type species Anthracosaurus russelli were named by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1863, based on fossils acquired by mining surveyor James Russell in 1861. Nearly all fossils were found near Airdrie, in the historic County Lanarkshire of Scotland. Geologically speaking, they hail from the Blackband Ironstone of the Scottish Middle Coal Measures. In traditional European stratigraphy, this layer would be dated to the Westphalian B, corresponding to the early-middle part of the Pennsylvanian (Late Carboniferous). The holotype is a large flattened cranium embedded in an ironstone nodule. Due to the tough mineral encrustation, it would take more than a century for the skull to be fully prepared and cleared of matrix. Subsequent to Huxley's original description, incremental preparation allowed for the skull to be redescribed by Watson (1929) and later Panchen (1977). Other fossils from Airdrie include lower jaw fragments, teeth, vertebrae, and possibly a partial interclavicle. It is uncertain whether the postcranial fossils truly belong to Anthracosaurus. The vertebrae are undiagnostic beyond their embolomerous form, while the interclavicle shows similarity to that of Pholiderpeton.\n\n\n=== England ===\nA second, less complete skull from Washington (in the historic County Durham of England) was assigned to Anthracosaurus russelli by Panchen et al. (1967). It is slightly older than the Scottish fossils, dating to the Lower Coal Measures (Westphalian A). Panchen (1981) expanded the list of English fossils with an incomplete jaw stored in the Hancock Museum, possibly from the Lower Main Seam of Newsham, Northumberland (Westphalian B). Clack (1987) described two additional Anthracosaurus fossils from Newsham: a partial skull roof (previously referred to Pteroplax cornuta or Eogyrinus attheyi) and an isolated jugal bone.\n\n\n=== Ohio ===\nRomer (1963) showed that the tooth of an animal that J. S. Newberry named \"Rhizodus lancifer,\" from the Diamond Coal Mine, a Carboniferous site in Linton, Ohio, belonged to a species of Anthracosaurus. Now known as Anthracosaurus lancifer, this species is represented by a collection of isolated teeth, vertebrae, and molds of a snout and shoulder girdle. The snout shows enlarged premaxillary teeth, but this trait is present in other American embolomeres like Eobaphetes and Neopteroplax. Another embolomere described from Linton, Leptophractus obsoletus, probably represents an early growth phase of Anthracosaurus lancifer.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nClassification of Anthracosaurus\nThe evolution of tetrapods began about 400 million years ago in the Devonian Period with the earliest tetrapods evolved from lobe-finned fishes. Tetrapods (under the apomorphy-based definition used on this page) are categorized as animals in the biological superclass Tetrapoda, which includes all living and extinct amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. While most species today are terrestrial, little evidence supports the idea that any of the earliest tetrapods could move about on land, as their limbs could not have held their midsections off the ground and the known trackways do not indicate they dragged their bellies around. Presumably, the tracks were made by animals walking along the bottoms of shallow bodies of water. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear. They are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present.\nMost amphibians today remain semiaquatic, living the first stage of their lives as fish-like tadpoles. Several groups of tetrapods, such as the snakes and cetaceans, have lost some or all of their limbs. In addition, many tetrapods have returned to partially aquatic or fully aquatic lives throughout the history of the group (modern examples of fully aquatic tetrapods include cetaceans and sirenians). The first returns to an aquatic lifestyle may have occurred as early as the Carboniferous Period whereas other returns occurred as recently as the Cenozoic, as in cetaceans, pinnipeds, and several modern amphibians.\nThe change from a body plan for breathing and navigating in water to a body plan enabling the animal to move on land is one of the most profound evolutionary changes known. It is also one of the best understood, largely thanks to a number of significant transitional fossil finds in the late 20th century combined with improved phylogenetic analysis.\n\n\n== Origin ==\n\n\n=== Evolution of fish ===\n\nThe Devonian period is traditionally known as the \"Age of Fish\", marking the diversification of numerous extinct and modern major fish groups. Among them were the early bony fishes, who diversified and spread in freshwater and brackish environments at the beginning of the period. The early types resembled their cartilaginous ancestors in many features of their anatomy, including a shark-like tailfin, spiral gut, large pectoral fins stiffened in front by skeletal elements and a largely unossified axial skeleton.\nThey did, however, have certain traits separating them from cartilaginous fishes, traits that would become pivotal in the evolution of terrestrial forms. With the exception of a pair of spiracles, the gills did not open singly to the exterior as they do in sharks; rather, they were encased in a gill chamber stiffened by membrane bones and covered by a bony operculum, with a single opening to the exterior. The cleithrum bone, forming the posterior margin of the gill chamber, also functioned as anchoring for the pectoral fins. The cartilaginous fishes do not have such an anchoring for the pectoral fins. This allowed for a movable joint at the base of the fins in the early bony fishes, and would later function in a weight bearing structure in tetrapods. As part of the overall armour of rhomboid cosmin scales, the skull had a full cover of dermal bone, constituting a skull roof over the otherwise shark-like cartilaginous inner cranium. Importantly, they also had a pair of ventral paired lungs, a feature lacking in sharks and rays.\nIt was assumed that fishes to a large degree evolved around reefs, but since their origin about 480 million years ago, they lived in near-shore environments like intertidal areas or permanently shallow lagoons and didn't start to  proliferate into other biotopes before 60 million years later. A few adapted to deeper water, while solid and heavily built forms stayed where they were or migrated into freshwater. The increase of primary productivity on land during the late Devonian changed\nThe Lissamphibia (from Greek λισσός (lissós, \"smooth\") + ἀμφίβια (amphíbia), meaning \"smooth amphibians\") is a group of tetrapods that includes all modern amphibians. Lissamphibians consist of three living groups: the Salientia (frogs, toads, and their extinct relatives), the Caudata (salamanders, newts, and their extinct relatives), and the Gymnophiona (the limbless caecilians and their extinct relatives).\nSalientians and caudatans are likely more closely related to each other than to caecilians. The name Batrachia is commonly used for the clade combining salientians and caudatans. A fourth group, the Allocaudata (also known as Albanerpetontidae) is also known, spanning 160 million years from the Middle Jurassic to the Early Pleistocene, but became extinct two million years ago.\nFor several decades, this name has been used for a group that includes all living amphibians, but excludes all the main groups of Paleozoic tetrapods, such as Temnospondyli, Lepospondyli, Embolomeri, and Seymouriamorpha. Most scientists have concluded that all of the primary groups of modern amphibians—frogs, salamanders and caecilians—are closely related.\nSome writers have argued that the early Permian dissorophoid Gerobatrachus hottoni is a lissamphibian. If it is not, the earliest known lissamphibians are Triadobatrachus and Czatkobatrachus from the Early Triassic.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nSome, if not all, lissamphibians share the following characteristics. Some of these apply to the soft body parts, hence do not appear in fossils. However, the skeletal characteristics also appear in several types of Palaeozoic amphibians:\n\nDouble or paired occipital condyles\nTwo types of skin glands (mucous and granular)\nFat bodies associated with gonads\nDouble-channeled sensory papillae in the inner ear\nGreen rods (a special type of visual cell, unknown in caecilians)\nRibs do not encircle body. In anurans the ribs are fused to their vertebrae, except in the suborder Archaeobatrachia which still has free ribs.\nAbility to elevate the eyes (with the levator bulbi muscle)\nForced-pump respiratory mechanism, the primitive breathing system also found in labyrinthodont amphibians\nCylindrical centra (the main body of the vertebrae; cylindrical centra are also found in several groups of early tetrapods)\nPedicellate teeth (the crowns of the teeth are separated from the roots by a zone of fibrous tissue; also found in some Dissorophoidea; the teeth of some fossil salamanders are not pedicellate)\nBicuspid teeth (two cusps per tooth, also found in juvenile dissorophoids)\nOperculum (small bone in the skull, linked to shoulder girdle by the opercularis muscle; perhaps involved in hearing and balance; absent in caecilians and some salamanders, fused to the columella (ear bone) in most anurans)\nLoss of posterior skull bones (also in Microsauria and Dissorophoidea)\nSmall, widely separated pterygoid bones (also found in Temnospondyli and Nectridea)\nWide cultriform process of the parasphenoid (also found in some Microsauria (Rhynchonkos) and Lysorophia)\nPresence of ampullae of Lorenzini in some salamanders and caecilians, but never in frogs\n\n\n== Relationships and definition ==\n\nThe features uniting the Lissamphibia were first noted by Ernst Haeckel, even though in Haeckel's work, Lissamphibia excluded the caecilians. Nevertheless, Haeckel considered the caecilians to be closely related to what he called Lissamphibia (gr. λισσός, smooth), which is now called Batrachia and includes frogs and salamanders. In the early to mid 20th century, a biphyletic origin of amphibians (and thus of tetrapods in general) was favoured. In the late 20th century, a flood of new fossil evidence mapped out in some detail the nature of the transition between the elpistostegalid fish and the early amphibians. Most herpetologists and paleontologists, therefore, no longer accept the view that amphibians have arisen twice, from two related but separate groups of fish. The question then arises whether Lissamphi\nIchthyostegalia is an order of extinct amphibians, representing the earliest landliving vertebrates. The group is thus an evolutionary grade rather than a clade. While the group are recognized as having feet rather than fins, most, if not all, had internal gills in adulthood and lived primarily as shallow water fish and spent minimal time on land.\nThe group evolved from elpistostegalian fish in the late Devonian, or possibly in the middle Devonian. They continued to thrive as denizens of swampland and tidal channels throughout the period. They gave rise to the Temnospondyli and then disappeared during the transition to the Carboniferous.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nIchthyostegalia\nAcanthostegidae\nAcanthostega\nCrassigyrinidae\nCrassigyrinus\nDensignathidae\nDensignathus\nElginerpetontidae\nElginerpeton\nObruchevichthys\nIchthyostegidae\nHynerpeton\nIchthyostega\nJakubsonidae\nJakubsonia\nMetaxygnathidae\nMetaxygnathus\nSinostegidae\nSinostega\nTulerpetontidae\nTulerpeton\nVentastegidae\nVentastega\nYmeridae\nYmeria\n\n\n== Description ==\nAs first described, the order's sole member was Ichthyostega, from which the group takes its name. Ichthyostega was seen as transitional between fish and the early Stegocephalians, in that it combines a flat, heavily armoured stegocephalian skull with a fishlike tail bearing fin rays. Later work on Ichthyostega and other Devonian Labyrinthodonts shows that they also had more than 5 digits to each foot, in fact the whole foot being fin-like. Acanthostega, later found in the same locations, appears to have had a soft operculum and both it and Ichthyostega possessed functional internal gills as adults.\nThe feet are only known from Ichthyostega, Acanthostega, and Tulerpeton, but appear to be polydactyl in all forms with more than the usual five digits for tetrapods and were paddle-like. The tail bore true fin rays like those found in fish.\nThe Ichthyostegalians were large to medium-sized, with an adult size form most genera on the order of a meter or more. Their heads were flat and massive, with a host of labyrinthodont teeth. They were carnivorous and probably mainly ate fish, but may also have fed on washed-up carcasses of fish and other marine life, and hunted unwary arthropods and other invertebrate life along the tidal channels of the coal swamps. The vertebrae were complex and rather weak. At the close of the Devonian, forms with progressively stronger legs and vertebrae evolved, and the later groups lacked functional gills as adults. As adults, the animals would have been heavy and clumsy on land, and would probably appear more as fish that occasionally went ashore rather than proper land animals. All were however predominately aquatic and some spent all or nearly all their lives in water.\n\n\n== Genera ==\nThe order Ichthyostegalia was erected for Ichthyostega, and contained until the 1980s only three genera (Ichthyostega, Acanthostega and Tulerpeton). While Ichthyostegalia in principle contain the most basal of animals with toes rather than fins, Clack and Ahlberg uses it for all finds more advanced than Tiktaalik (the closest relative of tetrapods known to have retained paired fins rather than feet).  Under this use, the number of known Devonian tetrapods have increased dramatically, so that the group now contain 12 genera: Most of the newer finds are redescriptions of very fragmentary finds, usually just the lower jaw. These were thought to have been from fish when found, but cladistic analyses indicate they are more advanced than Tiktaalik, though whether they actually had feet rather than fins is unknown. In order of discovery:\n\nIchthyostega\nAcanthostega\nTulerpeton\nMetaxygnathus\nElginerpeton\nObruchevichthys\nVentastega\nHynerpeton\nDensignathus\nSinostega\nJakubsonia\nYmeria\n\n\n== References ==\nElpistostegalia is a clade containing Panderichthys and all more derived tetrapodomorph taxa. The earliest elpistostegalians, combining fishlike and tetrapod-like characters, such as Tiktaalik, are sometimes called fishapods. Although historically Elpistostegalia (referred to as Panderichthyida) was considered an order of prehistoric lobe-finned fishes, it was cladistically redefined to include tetrapods.\n\n\n== Paleobiology ==\nA rise in global oxygen content allowed for the evolution of large, predatory fish that were able to exploit the shallow tidal areas and swamplands as top predators. Several groups evolved to fill these niches, the most successful were the elpistiostegalians. In such environments, they would have been challenged by periodic oxygen deficiency.  In comparable modern aquatic environments like shallow eutrophic lakes and swampland, modern lungfish and some genera of catfish also rely on the more stable, atmospheric source of oxygen.\nBeing shallow-water fishes, the elpistostegalians evolved many of the basic adaptions that later allowed the tetrapods to become terrestrial animals. The most important ones were the shift of main propulsion apparatus from the tail fin to the pectoral and pelvic fins, and a shift to reliance on lungs rather than gills as the main means of obtaining oxygen. Both of these appear to be a direct result of moving to an inland freshwater mode of living.\nFossils of Panderichthys are dated to the Givetian (around 385 million years old) or the Frasnian (around 380–375 million years old).  Thus, the oldest bone remains of elpistostegalians appear in the late Middle Devonian or in the early Late Devonian. However, a series of trace fossils from the early Middle Devonian of Poland suggests that tetrapod-limbed animals may have existed as early as in the Eifelian, around 395 million years ago.\n\n\n== Traits ==\nPaleontologist and professor Per E. Ahlberg has identified the following traits as synapomorphic for Elpistostegalia (and thus Tetrapoda):\n\nThe endocranium is hinged, the hinge forming the profundus nerve foramen. The cranial kinesis is also visible in the skull roof, between the parietal bones and the postparietal bones.\nA rather small shoulder girdle is present.\nThe anal and posterior dorsal fin supported by a basal plate and three unjointed radials.\nThe pectoral fin skeleton is composed of bones homologous to the tetrapod humerus, ulna, and radius, followed by a host of smaller bones anchoring the fin rays; the pelvic fin skeleton similarly has femur, tibia, and fibula.\n\n\n== Phylogeny ==\nThe name, originally coined around the genus Elpistostege, later become a synonym for Panderichthyida. In most analyses, the group as traditionally imagined is actually an evolutionary grade, the last \"fishes\" of the tetrapod stem line, though Chang and Yu (1997) treated them as the sister clade to Tetrapoda. Elpistostegalia was re-defined as a clade containing Panderichthys and tetrapods.\nBelow is a cladogram from Swartz, 2012.\n\nThe 2020 study by Cloutier et al. revealed that the paired fins of Elpistostege contained bones homologous to the phalanges (digit bones) of modern tetrapods. The analysis carried out in this study recovered Elpistostege as the sister taxon of all unequivocally digited vertebrates.\n\n\n== References ==\nOsteolepiformes, also known as Osteolepidida, is a group of prehistoric lobe-finned fishes which first appeared during the Devonian period. The order contains the families Canowindridae, Megalichthyidae, Osteolepididae and Tristichopteridae, in addition to several monotypic families. The order is generally considered to be paraphyletic because the characters that define it are mainly attributes of stem tetrapodomorphs.\nThe following taxonomy is based on Borgen & Nakrem, 2016:\n\nOrder †Osteolepiformes\nSuborder †Osteolepidoidei\nFamily †Osteolepididae\nFamily †Thursiidae\nFamily †Megalichthyidae\nSuborder †Cyclolepidoidei\nSuperfamily †Eopodoidea\nFamily †Chrysolepididae\nFamily †Gyroptychiidae\nFamily Panderichthyidae (incl.

Its remains were discovered in the Posongchong Formation. It is the basalmost known tetrapodomorph.\n\n\n== References ==\nAdelospondyli is an order of elongated, presumably aquatic, Carboniferous amphibians (sensu lato). They have a robust skull roofed with solid bone, and orbits located towards the front of the skull.  The limbs were almost certainly absent, although some historical sources reported them to be present. Despite the likely absence of limbs, adelospondyls retained a large part of the bony shoulder girdle. Adelospondyls have been assigned to a variety of groups in the past. They have traditionally been seen as members of the subclass Lepospondyli, related to other unusual early tetrapods such as \"microsaurs\", \"nectrideans\", and aïstopods. Analyses such as Ruta & Coates (2007) have offered an alternate classification scheme, arguing that adelospondyls were actually far removed from other lepospondyls, instead being stem-tetrapod stegocephalians closely related to the family Colosteidae.\nMost adelospondyls belong to the family Adelogyrinidae, and prior to 2003 the order and family were considered synonymous. In 2003, Ruta et al. assigned Acherontiscus to the order as the only known non-adelogyrinid member. Members of this group are very rare; only six known specimens can be assigned to the five known genera with absolute confidence. These specimens are known from Mississippian (Serpukhovian Age) geological deposits in Scotland, and they were among the oldest \"lepospondyls\" known from fossils.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nAdelospondyls share a variety of traits with other lepospondyls, although whether these traits are an example of convergent evolution is a controversial topic. Like the aïstopods and lysorophian \"microsaurs\", they had very elongated bodies similar to that of snakes and eels. In addition, they lacked limbs (similarly to the aïstopods), although forelimbs were supposedly found in various adelogyrinids in the late 1960s. Andrews & Carroll (1991) found that all cases of forelimb bones in adelogyrinids were actually misinterpretations. For example, putative forelimbs discovered in Adelogyrinus and Palaeomolgophis by Brough & Brough (1967) were re-identified as hyoid bones and ribs, respectively. Carroll (1967) also claimed that forelimbs were present in Adelospondylus, but these later considered to be hyoids as in Adelogyrinus.\n\n\n=== Skull ===\nAdelospondyls had somewhat long and low skulls, with large orbits (eye sockets) shifted towards the front of the skull. As a result, the proportions of the skull bones were affected. For example, the nasal bones along the midline of the skull in front of the eyes were much shorter than the frontal bones directly behind them, which extended forwards past the level of the eyes. The frontal bones were omitted from the edge of the orbits (eye holes) due to a contact between the pre- and post-frontals which typically lie in front of and behind the orbits, respectively. Unlike lysorophians and aïstopods, which had snake-like skulls with large openings and reduced bone material, adelospondyl skulls were strongly built and covered with ridges, pits, and grooves, including lateral line sulci. They typically possessed many teeth, although such teeth differ in structure between families. Adelogyrinids, for example, had many numerous \"chisel-shaped\" teeth, while Acherontiscus had blunt teeth at the back of the mouth and sharp, thin teeth at the front. As is the case in other lepospondyls, the teeth of adelospondyls did not have a  maze-like internal structure like those of \"labyrinthodonts\", nor did adelospondyls possess enlarged fang-like teeth on the roof of the mouth.\n\nSimilar to various other lepospondyls, adelospondyls lost several bones in the temporal region of the skull, which is at the back of the skull between the quadratojugal bone of the jaw joint and the parietal and postparietal bones at the midline of the skull roof. Stem- and crown-tetrapods typically have three to four bones on each side of the skull in this region (from top to bottom): the tabular, supratemporal (and sometimes an adjac\nBaphetidae is an extinct family of stem-tetrapods. Baphetids were large labyrinthodont predators of the Late Carboniferous period (Namurian through Westphalian) of Europe. Fragmentary remains from the Early Carboniferous of Canada have been tentatively assigned to the group. The phylogenetic relationships of baphetids is uncertain; while many studies have placed the group as a close relative of Amniota, other analyses have found Baphetidae to be a more basal clade of early stem tetrapods. Baphetids were among the first of the Carboniferous fossil tetrapods to be found and were originally described in 1850 by John William Dawson. The baphetids have been referred to the family Loxommatidae, but this group was later shown to be a junior synonym of Baphetidae, which was named earlier in 1865. Baphetids are known mainly from skulls; very little postcranial material has been found.\n\n\n== Palaeobiology ==\nThe presence of lateral lines and the long rows of needle-like teeth show that most were fish-eaters.  Their development was likely amphibian, though no larval fossils are known. Their best-known characteristic was a curious, keyhole-shaped orbit formed by excavation of the lacrimal and prefrontal bones in front of the eye.  It has been suggested that this space accommodated a salt gland or some kind of electrosensory organ.  Perhaps the better hypothesis is that the space allowed room for the contraction of an enlarged pterygoideus muscle.  In that case, this skull modification would represent an early form of skull fenestration for jaw muscles.\nThe skull is shallow.  Unlike the better-known embolomeres, the baphetid cheek and skull roof are sutured together.  There is a strongly embayed spiracular (\"otic\") notch, but the stapes is distally broad, which seems to rule out a sensitive hearing apparatus.  The palate is closed—a primitive character, but very different from the temnospondyls.  The coronoids bear no teeth or denticles, while the dentary has a double tooth row.\nSince the taxon is based almost exclusively on skulls, the body is very poorly known.  It is often said that the body was crocodile-like, but this appears to be largely supposition.  \n\nIt is not clear whether all of the genera assigned to this group are really closely related.  The traditional four genera of baphetids (Loxomma, Baphetes, Megalocephalus, and Spathicephalus) have recently been supplemented by Eucritta, a somewhat different form.  It has also been suggested that Crassigyrinus may be closely related.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nBaphetids were first described by Edward Drinker Cope when he erected the family Baphetidae in 1865 for Baphetes. Richard Lydekker named Loxomatinae in 1889 for Loxomma, which later became known as Loxommatidae. D. M. S. Watson described the group as Loxommidae in 1917. Later studies have shown Baphetes and Loxomma to be close relatives within the same family, and because Baphetidae was named before Loxommatidae, it has seniority and is the valid name of the group.\n\n\n=== Phylogeny ===\nBaphetids have been previously considered primitive temnospondyls and more recently batrachosaurs (reptile-like amphibia).   It is likely, however, that they represent one more of a number of early Carboniferous tetrapodomorph radiations.  Computer-assisted phylogenetic analyses of a data matrix using characteristics of most of the major groups of terrestrial vertebrates place the Baphetids close to the ancestry of amniotes.\nWith the reinterpretation of the Ichthyostegalia as aquatic forms, baphetids are good candidates for the spot of first labyrinthodont group to actually spend substantial time on land. If so, baphetids may be a rather important taxon.\n\n\n== References ==\nHarajicadectes (IPA: [ˌhɑːɾɑːdʒɪkɑːˈdektes]) (meaning \"Harajica biter\") is a genus of stem-tetrapod from the Givetian to Frasnian Amadeus Basin in Northern Territory, Australia.

Traditionally considered a subclass of the class Amphibia, modern classification systems recognize that labyrinthodonts are not a formal natural group (clade) exclusive of other tetrapods. Instead, they consistute an evolutionary grade (a paraphyletic group), ancestral to living tetrapods such as lissamphibians (modern amphibians) and amniotes (reptiles, mammals, and kin). \"Labyrinthodont\"-grade vertebrates evolved from lobe-finned fishes in the Devonian, though a formal boundary between fish and amphibian is difficult to define at this point in time.\n\"Labyrinthodont\" generally refers to extinct four-limbed tetrapods with a large body size and a crocodile-like lifestyle. The name describes the pattern of infolding of the dentin and enamel of the teeth, which are often the only part of the creatures that fossilize. They are also distinguished by a broad, strongly-built skull roof composed of many small heavily-textured skull bones. \"Labyrinthodonts\" generally have complex multi-part vertebrae, and several classification schemes have utilized vertebrae to define subgroups.\nBecause labyrinthodonts do not form a monophyletic group, many modern researchers have abandoned the term. However, some have continued to use the group in their classifications, at least informally, pending more detailed study of their relationships. Many authors prefer to simply use the term tetrapod, while others have re-defined the previously obsolete term Stegocephalia (\"roof heads\") as a cladistic alternative to \"Labyrinthodontia\" or \"Tetrapoda\".\n\n\n== Labyrinthodont traits ==\n\nThe labyrinthodonts flourished for more than 200 million years.

The relative development and shape of the elements is highly variable.\n\n\n== The labyrinthodonts in life ==\n\n\n=== General build ===\nLabyrinthodonts were generally amphibian-like in build. They were short-legged and mostly large headed, with moderately short to long tails. Many groups, and all the early forms, were large animals. Primitive members of all labyrinthodont groups were probably true water predators, and various degrees of amphibious, semi-aquatic and semi terrestrial modes of living arose independently in different groups. Some lineages remained waterbound or became secondarily fully aquatic with reduced limbs and elongated, eel-like bodies.\n\n\n=== Skull ===\n\nWith the exception of the snake-like aïstopods, the skulls of labyrinthodonts were massive.

The existence of a true low point in vertebrate diversity has been supported by independent lines of evidence, however recent finds in five new locations in Scotland have yielded multiple fossils of early tetrapods and amphibians.

Although there is evidence that the Crassigyrinus eventually lost its limbs, there is counterevidence in that it used its limbs for movement, as proven by healing in the bones in case of injury.

In this scheme, the name Batrachomorpha is given to this branch of amphibians, while the name Reptiliomorpha denotes the other branch. While the actual phylogeny of the modern amphibians is not well understood, their ancestors are descended from one line of batrachomorphs. All other living tetrapods (reptiles, birds and mammals) are descended from one branch of reptiliomorphs, the amniotes. Amniotes achieved dominance, while all other reptiliomorphs and most batrachomorphs have gone extinct."

In this view amphibians would be a biphyletic group, and Batrachomorpha was erected to form a natural group consisting of the \"true amphibians\" (i.e. frogs in Säve-Söderberghs view) and their fossil relatives.

This spurred the initial describers to argue that it was the oldest known animal with claws on each hand, and marks the earliest clawed foot. Claws are extremely rare among amphibians, but ubiquitous among amniotes, so their supposed presence in Casineria has been considered to be evidence towards its amniote identity. Claws are also a feature intimately bound to the formation of keratinous scales in reptiles, so in life, Casineria would  have borne scaly, reptilian-type skin, and would have resembled a small lizard (despite being only distantly related to true lizards)."

In the early Carboniferous period before the appearance of Casineria, vertebrates were primarily aquatic, only spending part of their time on land. Casineria was believed to be among the first vertebrates to live and reproduce on land.\nHowever, later studies have not consistently placed Casineria as an early amniote.

The vertebrae were complex and rather weak. At the close of the Devonian, forms with progressively stronger legs and vertebrae evolved, and the later groups lacked functional gills as adults. As adults, the animals would have been heavy and clumsy on land, and would probably appear more as fish that occasionally went ashore rather than proper land animals.

If so, baphetids may be a rather important taxon.\n\n\n== References ==\nHarajicadectes (IPA: [ˌhɑːɾɑːdʒɪkɑːˈdektes]) (meaning \"Harajica biter\") is a genus of stem-tetrapod from the Givetian to Frasnian Amadeus Basin in Northern Territory, Australia.

Instead, they consistute an evolutionary grade (a paraphyletic group), ancestral to living tetrapods such as lissamphibians (modern amphibians) and amniotes (reptiles, mammals, and kin). \"Labyrinthodont\"-grade vertebrates evolved from lobe-finned fishes in the Devonian, though a formal boundary between fish and amphibian is difficult to define at this point in time."

They are also distinguished by a broad, strongly-built skull roof composed of many small heavily-textured skull bones. \"Labyrinthodonts\" generally have complex multi-part vertebrae, and several classification schemes have utilized vertebrae to define subgroups.\nBecause labyrinthodonts do not form a monophyletic group, many modern researchers have abandoned the term. However, some have continued to use the group in their classifications, at least informally, pending more detailed study of their relationships. Many authors prefer to simply use the term tetrapod, while others have re-defined the previously obsolete term Stegocephalia (\"roof heads\") as a cladistic alternative to \"Labyrinthodontia\" or \"Tetrapoda\"."

They were short-legged and mostly large headed, with moderately short to long tails. Many groups, and all the early forms, were large animals. Primitive members of all labyrinthodont groups were probably true water predators, and various degrees of amphibious, semi-aquatic and semi terrestrial modes of living arose independently in different groups. Some lineages remained waterbound or became secondarily fully aquatic with reduced limbs and elongated, eel-like bodies.\n\n\n=== Skull ===\n\nWith the exception of the snake-like aïstopods, the skulls of labyrinthodonts were massive.  The broad head and short neck may have been a result of respiratory constraints. Their jaws were lined with small, sharp, conical teeth and the roof of the mouth bore larger tusk-like teeth.
