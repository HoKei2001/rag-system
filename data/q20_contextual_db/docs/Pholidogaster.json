{"page_content": "Pholidogaster ('scaly stomach') is an extinct genus of stem-tetrapod that lived during the Middle Carboniferous period (late Vis\u00e9an to early Serpukhovian). Pholidogaster is known from only two specimens found in Gilmerton, Scotland. Historically it was one of the first to show science the evolutionary link between fish and amphibians.\nThis animal had a very long and slender body, with small and feeble limbs. The shoulder structure is further back than is usual. Belly scales are present (hence its name), suggesting that in life it did not just swim, but scrawled over hard surfaces as well. The structure of the jaw is not clear, since the jaw bones on both specimens are not well preserved. However, there are large fangs in the front of the mouth, presumably used in hunting. It was a small to medium-sized animal around 1 m in length.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Pholidogaster\". Palaeos.com.

It was among the earliest four-limbed vertebrates ever in the fossil record and was one of the first with weight-bearing adaptations for terrestrial locomotion. Ichthyostega possessed lungs and limbs that helped it navigate through shallow water in swamps. Although Ichthyostega is often labelled a 'tetrapod' because of its limbs and fingers, it evolved long before true crown group tetrapods and could more accurately be referred to as a stegocephalian or stem tetrapod. Likewise, while undoubtedly of amphibian build and habit, it is not a true member of the group in the narrow sense, as the first modern amphibians (members of the group Lissamphibia) appeared in the Triassic Period. Until finds of other early stegocephalians and closely related fishes in the late 20th century, Ichthyostega stood alone as a transitional fossil between fish and tetrapods, combining fish and tetrapod features. Newer research has shown that it had an unusual anatomy, functioning more akin to a seal than a salamander, as previously assumed.\n\n\n== History ==\n \nIn 1932 Gunnar S\u00e4ve-S\u00f6derbergh described four Ichthyostega species from the Late Devonian of East Greenland and one species belonging to the genus Ichthyostegopsis, I. wimani. These species could be synonymous (in which case only I. stensioei would remain), because their morphological differences are not very pronounced. The species differ in skull proportions, skull punctuation and skull bone patterns. The comparisons were done on 14 specimens collected in 1931 by the Danish East Greenland Expedition. Additional specimens were collected between 1933 and 1955.\n\n\n== Description ==\nIchthyostega was a fairly large animal for its time, as it was broadly built and about 1.5 m (4.9 ft) long. The skull was low, with dorsally placed eyes and large labyrinthodont teeth. The posterior margin of the skull formed an operculum covering the gills. The spiracle was situated in an otic notch behind each eye. Computed tomography has revealed that Ichthyostega had a specialized ear, including a stapes with a unique morphology compared to other tetrapods or to any fish hyomandibula. \n\n\n=== Postcranial skeleton ===\nThe legs were large compared to contemporary relatives. It had seven digits on each hind leg, along with a peculiar, poorly ossified mass which lies anteriorly adjacent to the digits. The exact number of digits on the forelimb is not yet known, since fossils of the hand have not been found. While in water, the foot would have functioned like a fleshy paddle more than a fin.The vertebral column and ribcage of Ichthyostega was unusual and highly specialized relative to both its contemporaries and later tetrapods. The thoracic vertebrae at the front of the trunk and the short neck have tall neural spines that lean backwards. They attach to pointed ribs which increase in size and acquire prominent overlapping flanges. Past the sixth or seventh flanged rib, the ribs abruptly decrease in size and lose their flanges. The lumbar vertebrae at the back of the trunk have strong muscle scars and neural spines which are bent forwards and decrease in size towards the hips. The sacral vertebrae above the hips have fan-shaped neural spines that transition from forward-leaning to backward-leaning as they approach the tail. The vertebrae right behind the hips have unusually large ribs similar to those of the thoracic region. The caudal vertebrae have slender spines that lean backwards. The tail of Ichthyostega retained a low fin supported by bony lepidotrichia (fin rays). The tail fin was not as deep as in Acanthostega, and would have been less useful for swimming.\n\nIchthyostega is related to Acanthostega gunnari, which is also from what is now East Greenland. Ichthyostega's skull seems more fish-like than that of Acanthostega, but its pelvic girdle mo\nAcanthostega (meaning \"spiny roof\") is an extinct genus of stem-tetrapod, among the first vertebrate animals to have recognizable limbs. It appeared in the late Devonian period (Famennian age) about 365 million years ago, and was anatomically intermediate between lobe-finned fishes and those that were fully capable of coming onto land.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\n \nThe fossilized remains are generally well preserved, with the famous fossil by which the significance of this species  was discovered being found by Jennifer A. Clack in East Greenland in 1987, though fragments of the skull had been discovered in 1933 by Gunnar S\u00e4ve-S\u00f6derbergh and Erik Jarvik.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe 60 cm (24 in) Acanthostega had eight digits on each hand (the number of digits on the feet is unclear) linked by webbing, it lacked wrists, and was generally poorly adapted for walking on land. It also had a remarkably fish-like shoulder and forelimb. The front limbs of Acanthostega could not bend forward at the elbow, and  therefore could not be brought into a weight bearing position, appearing to be more suitable for paddling or for holding on to aquatic plants. Acanthostega is the earliest stem-tetrapod to show the shift in locomotory dominance from the pectoral girdle to the pelvic girdle.\nThere are many morphological changes that allowed the pelvic girdle of Acanthostega to become a weight-bearing structure. In more ancestral states the two sides of the girdle were not attached. In Acanthostega there is contact between the two sides and fusion of the girdle with the sacral rib of the vertebral column. These fusions would have made the pelvic region more powerful and equipped to counter the force of gravity when not supported by the buoyancy of an aquatic environment. It had internal gills that were covered like those of fish. It also had lungs, but its ribs were too short to support its chest cavity out of water.\n\n\n== Classification ==\n\nAcanthostega is seen as part of widespread evolutionary radiation in the late Devonian period, starting with purely aquatic finned tetrapodomorphs, with their successors showing increased air-breathing capability and related adaptions to the jaws and gills, as well as more muscular neck allowing freer movement of the head than fish have, and use of the fins to raise the body of the fish. These features are displayed by the earlier Tiktaalik, which like Ichthyostega showed signs of greater abilities to move around on land, but is thought to have been primarily aquatic.\nIn Late Devonian vertebrate speciation, descendants of pelagic lobe-finned fish \u2013like Eusthenopteron\u2013 exhibited a sequence of adaptations: Panderichthys, suited to muddy shallows; Tiktaalik with limb-like fins that could take it onto land; stem-tetrapods in weed-filled swamps, such as Acanthostega, which had eight-digited feet; and Ichthyostega, with full limbs. Their descendants also included pelagic lobe-finned fish such as coelacanth species.\n\n\n== Paleobiology ==\n\n\n=== Hunting strategy ===\n\nIt has been inferred that Acanthostega probably lived in shallow, weed-choked swamps, its legs apparently being adapted for these specific ecosystems. Apart from the presence of limbs, it was not adapted in any way for walking on land. Jennifer A. Clack interprets this as showing that Acanthostega was primarily an aquatic animal descended from fish that never left the sea, and that the specializations of the tetrapod lineage were exaptations: features which would later be useful for terrestrial life, even if they originated for a different purpose. At that period, deciduous plants were flourishing and annually shedding leaves into the water, attracting small prey into warm oxygen-poor shallows that were difficult for larger fish to swim in; Clack remarks on how the lower jaw of Acanthostega shows a change from those of fish that have two rows of teeth, with a large number of small teeth in the outer row, and two large fangs and some smaller teeth in the inner row. This di\nRomer's gap is an apparent gap in the Paleozoic tetrapod fossil record used in the study of evolutionary biology, which represent periods from which excavators have not yet found relevant fossils. It is named after American paleontologist Alfred Romer, who first recognised it in 1956. Recent discoveries in Scotland are beginning to close this gap in palaeontological knowledge.\n\n\n== Age ==\nRomer's gap runs from approximately 360 to 345 million years ago, corresponding to the first 15 million years of the Carboniferous, the early Mississippian (starting with the Tournaisian and moving into the Visean). The gap forms a discontinuity between the primitive forests and high diversity of fishes in the end Devonian and more modern aquatic and terrestrial assemblages of the early Carboniferous.\n\n\n== Mechanism behind the gap ==\nThere has been long debate as to why there are so few fossils from this time period. Some have suggested the problem was of fossilization itself, suggesting that there may have been differences in the geochemistry of the time that did not favour fossil formation. Also, excavators simply may not have dug in the right places. The existence of a true low point in vertebrate diversity has been supported by independent lines of evidence, however recent finds in five new locations in Scotland have yielded multiple fossils of early tetrapods and amphibians. They have also allowed the most accurate logging of the geology of this period. This new evidence suggests that - at least locally - there was no gap in diversity or changes in oxygen geochemistry.\nWhile initial arthropod terrestriality was well under way before the gap, and some digited tetrapods might have come on land, there are remarkably few terrestrial or aquatic fossils that date from the gap itself. Recent work on Paleozoic geochemistry has provided evidence for the biological reality of Romer's gap in both terrestrial vertebrates and arthropods, and has correlated it with a period of unusually low atmospheric oxygen concentration, which was determined from the idiosyncratic geochemistry of rocks formed during Romer's gap. The new sedimentary logging in the Ballagan Formation in Scotland challenges this, suggesting oxygen was stable throughout Romer's Gap.\nAquatic vertebrates, which include most tetrapods during the Carboniferous, were recovering from the Hangenberg event, a major extinction event that preceded Romer's gap, one on par with that which killed the dinosaurs. In this end-Devonian extinction, most marine and freshwater groups became extinct or were reduced to a few lineages, although the precise mechanism of the extinction is unclear. Before the event, oceans and lakes were dominated by lobe-finned fishes and armored fishes called placoderms. After the gap, modern ray finned fish, as well as sharks and their relatives were the dominant forms. The period also saw the demise of the Ichthyostegalia, the early fish-like amphibians with more than five digits.\nThe low diversity of marine fishes, particularly shell-crushing predators (durophages), at the beginning of Romer's gap is supported by the sudden abundance of hard-shelled crinoid echinoderms during the same period. The Tournaisian has even been called the \"Age of Crinoids\". Once the number of shell-crushing ray-finned fishes and sharks increased later in the Carboniferous, coincident with the end of Romer's gap, the diversity of crinoids with Devonian-type armor plummeted, following the pattern of a classic predator-prey (Lotka-Volterra) cycle. There is increasing evidence that lungfish and stem tetrapods and amphibians recovered quickly and diversified in the rapidly changing environment of the end-Devonian and Romer's Gap.\n\n\n== Gap fauna ==\n\nThe gap in the tetrapod record has been progressively closed with the discoveries of such early Carboniferous tetrapods as Pederpes and Crassigyrinus. There are a few sites where vertebrate fossils have been found to help fill in the gap, such as the East \nTemnospondyli (from Greek \u03c4\u03ad\u03bc\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, temnein 'to cut' and \u03c3\u03c0\u03cc\u03bd\u03b4\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, spondylos 'vertebra') or temnospondyls is a diverse ancient order of small to giant tetrapods\u2014often considered primitive amphibians\u2014that flourished worldwide during the Carboniferous, Permian and Triassic periods, with fossils being found on every continent. A few species continued into the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous periods, but all had gone extinct by the Late Cretaceous. During about 210 million years of evolutionary history, they adapted to a wide range of habitats, including freshwater, terrestrial, and even coastal marine environments. Their life history is well understood, with fossils known from the larval stage, metamorphosis and maturity. Most temnospondyls were semiaquatic, although some were almost fully terrestrial, returning to the water only to breed. These temnospondyls were some of the first vertebrates fully adapted to life on land. Although temnospondyls are amphibians, many had characteristics such as scales and large armour-like bony plates (osteoderms) that generally distinguish them from the modern soft-bodied lissamphibians (frogs and toads, newts, salamanders and caecilians).\nTemnospondyls have been known since the early 19th century, and were initially thought to be reptiles. They were described at various times as batrachians, stegocephalians and labyrinthodonts, although these names are now rarely used. Animals now grouped in Temnospondyli were spread out among several amphibian groups until the early 20th century, when they were found to belong to a distinct taxon based on the structure of their vertebrae. Temnospondyli means \"cut vertebrae\", as each vertebra is divided into several parts (intercentrum, paired pleurocentra, neural arch), although this occurs widely among other early tetrapods.\nExperts disagree over whether temnospondyls were ancestral to modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians), or whether the whole group died out without leaving any descendants. Different hypotheses have placed modern amphibians as the descendants of temnospondyls, as descendants of another group of early tetrapods called lepospondyls, or even as descendants of both groups (with caecilians evolving from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders evolving from temnospondyls). There is further disagreement about a temnospondyl origin of lissamphibians related to whether the modern groups arose from only one group (dissorophoids) or from two different groups (dissorophoids and stereospondyls). The majority of studies place a group of temnospondyls called amphibamiforms as the closest relatives of modern amphibians. Similarities in teeth, skulls and hearing structures link the two groups. Whether temnospondyls are considered part of the tetrapod crown or stem thus depends on their inferred relationship to lissamphibians.\n\n\n== Definitions ==\n\n\n=== Branch-based definition ===\nIn 2000, Adam Yates and Anne Warren defined the name Temnospondyli as applying to the clade encompassing all organisms that are more closely related to Eryops than to the \u201cmicrosaur\u201d Pantylus. By this definition, if lissamphibians are temnospondyls and Pantylus is a reptiliomorph, the name Temnospondyli is synonymous with Batrachomorpha (a clade containing all organisms that are more closely related to modern amphibians than to mammals and reptiles).\n\n\n=== Node-based definition ===\nRainer Schoch in 2013 defined the name Temnospondyli as applying to \u201c[t]he least inclusive clade containing Edops craigi and Mastodonsaurus giganteus\u201d.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nMany temnospondyls are much larger than living amphibians, and superficially resemble crocodiles, which has led many taxa to be named with the suffix -suchus. The largest taxa, which were predominantly the Mesozoic stereospondyls, had skulls exceeding one meter in length, and the entire animal would have been several meters in length (for reference, the largest living amphibian, Andrias, is about 1.8 meters in body length).\nTiktaalik (; Inuktitut \u144e\u1483\u1456\u14d5\u1483 [tikta\u02d0lik]) is a monospecific genus of extinct sarcopterygian (lobe-finned fish) from the Late Devonian Period, about 375 Mya (million years ago), having many features akin to those of tetrapods (four-legged animals). Tiktaalik is estimated to have had a total length of 1.25\u20132.75 metres (4.1\u20139.0 ft) based on various specimens.\nUnearthed in Arctic Canada, Tiktaalik is a non-tetrapod member of Osteichthyes (bony fish), complete with scales and gills\u2014but it has a triangular, flattened head and unusual, cleaver-shaped fins. Its fins have thin ray bones for paddling like most fish, but they also have sturdy interior bones that would have allowed Tiktaalik to prop itself up in shallow water and use its limbs for support as most four-legged animals do. Those fins and other mixed characteristics mark Tiktaalik as a crucial transition fossil, a link in evolution from swimming fish to four-legged vertebrates. This and similar animals might be the common ancestors of all vertebrate terrestrial fauna: amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals.\nThe first Tiktaalik fossils were found in 2004 on Ellesmere Island in Nunavut, Canada. The discovery, made by Edward B. Daeschler of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Neil H. Shubin from the University of Chicago, and Harvard University Professor Farish A. Jenkins Jr., was published in the April 6, 2006 issue of Nature and quickly recognized as a transitional form.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\n\nIn 2004, three fossilized Tiktaalik skeletons were discovered in the Late Devonian fluvial Fram Formation on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, in northern Canada. Estimated ages were reported at 375 Ma, 379 Ma and 383 Ma. At the time of the species' existence, Ellesmere Island was part of the continent Laurentia (modern eastern North America and Greenland), which was centered on the equator and had a warm climate. When discovered, one of the skulls was found sticking out of a cliff. Upon further inspection, the fossil was found to be in excellent condition for a 375-million-year-old specimen.\nThe discovery by Daeschler, Shubin and Jenkins was published in the April 6, 2006 issue of Nature and quickly recognized as a transitional form. Jennifer A. Clack, a Cambridge University expert on tetrapod evolution, said of Tiktaalik, \"It's one of those things you can point to and say, 'I told you this would exist,' and there it is.\" \n\n \nAfter five years of digging on Ellesmere Island, in the far north of Nunavut, they hit pay dirt: a collection of several fish so beautifully preserved that their skeletons were still intact. As Shubin's team studied the species they saw to their excitement that it was exactly the missing intermediate they were looking for. 'We found something that really split the difference right down the middle,' says Daeschler.\nTiktaalik is an Inuktitut word meaning \"large freshwater fish\". The \"fishapod\" genus received this name after a suggestion by Inuit elders of Canada's Nunavut Territory, where the fossil was discovered. The specific name roseae honours an anonymous donor. Taking a detailed look at the internal head skeleton of Tiktaalik roseae, in the October 16, 2008, issue of Nature, researchers show how Tiktaalik was gaining structures that could allow it to support itself on solid ground and breathe air, a key intermediate step in the transformation of the skull that accompanied the shift to life on land by our distant ancestors. More than 60 specimens of Tiktaalik have been discovered, though the holotype remains the most complete and well-described fossil.\n\n\n== Description ==\nTiktaalik provides insights on the features of the extinct closest relatives of the tetrapods. Tiktaalik was a large fish: the largest known fossils have an estimated length of 2.75 m (9.02 feet), with the longest lower jaws reaching a length of 31 centimetres (1.0 ft).\n\n\n=== Skull and neck ===\n The skull of Tiktaalik was low and flat, more similar in shape to that of a crocodile than most fish. The rear ed\nTetrapodomorpha (also known as Choanata) is a clade of vertebrates consisting of tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) and their closest sarcopterygian relatives that are more closely related to living tetrapods than to living lungfish. Advanced forms transitional between fish and the early labyrinthodonts, such as Tiktaalik, have been referred to as \"fishapods\" by their discoverers, being half-fish, half-tetrapods, in appearance and limb morphology. The Tetrapodomorpha contains the crown group tetrapods (the last common ancestor of living tetrapods and all of its descendants) and several groups of early stem tetrapods, which includes several groups of related lobe-finned fishes, collectively known as the osteolepiforms. The Tetrapodomorpha minus the crown group Tetrapoda are the stem Tetrapoda, a paraphyletic unit encompassing the fish to tetrapod transition.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nAmong the characteristics defining tetrapodomorphs are modifications to the fins, notably a humerus with convex head articulating with the glenoid fossa (the socket of the shoulder joint). Another key trait is the internal nostril or choana. Most fish have two pairs of nostrils, one on either side of the head for incoming water (incurrent nostrils) and another pair for outgoing water (excurrent nostrils). In early tetrapodomorphs like Kenichthys, the excurrent nostrils had shifted towards the mouth's perimeter. In later tetrapodomorphs, including tetrapods, the excurrent nostril is positioned inside the mouth, where it is known as the choana. The nearly-equivalent clade Choanata often refers to these later forms specifically.\n\n\n== History ==\nTetrapodomorph fossils are known from the early Devonian onwards, and include Osteolepis, Panderichthys, Kenichthys and Tungsenia. Tetrapodomorpha evolved from ancient lobe-finned fish (sarcopterygians) around 390 million years ago in the Middle Devonian period.\n\n\n== Classification ==\n\n\n=== Taxonomy ===\nAfter Benton, 2004; and Swartz, 2012.\n\nSubclass Sarcopterygii\nInfraclass Tetrapodomorpha\nOrder \u2020Rhizodontida\nFamily \u2020Sauripteridae\nFamily \u2020Rhizodontidae\nSuperorder \u2020Osteolepidida (or Osteolepiformes)\nFamily \u2020Canowindridae\nFamily \u2020Thysanolepidae\nFamily \u2020Tristichopteridae\nOrder \u2020Osteolepiformes (or Megalichthyiformes)\nFamily \u2020Osteolepidae\nFamily \u2020Megalichthyidae\nClade Eotetrapodiformes\nClade Elpistostegalia (or Panderichthyida)\nClade Stegocephalia\nFamily \u2020Elpistostegidae\nFamily \u2020Whatcheeriidae\nFamily \u2020Colosteidae\nSuperfamily \u2020Baphetoidea\nSuperclass Tetrapoda\nOther clades include the Eotetrapodiformes (Tinirau, Platycephalichthys, the Tristichopteridae and Elpistostegalia).

It belonged to Rhizodontida, one of the earliest-diverging tetrapodomorph clades. Two valid species have been described, both of which lived during the Early Carboniferous epoch. The type species R. hibberti is known from the Vis\u00e9an stage of the United Kingdom, whereas the species R. serpukhovensis is from the Serpukhovian of Russia. Some fossils referred to the genus Rhizodus have also been found in North America.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe most notable characteristics of Rhizodus, compared to other giant rhizodonts such as Barameda, were the two 22-centimetre (8.7 in) fangs located near the front of its jaws, followed by other teeth scaling downwards in size. Rhizodus was a giant apex predator that resided in freshwater lakes, river systems and large swamps, with R. hibberti measuring 5.14\u20135.63 metres (16.9\u201318.5 ft) long and weighing 1\u20131.5 metric tons (1.1\u20131.7 short tons). It fed on small to medium-sized amphibians, using its teeth to kill prey and rip it into digestible sizes, rather than swallowing prey whole like other, smaller-toothed sarcopterygians.\nFossil skin imprints show that Rhizodus had large, plate-like scales, similar to those found on modern day arapaima.\n\n\n== Diet ==\nThe diet of Rhizodus' included medium-sized fish and tetrapods. It has been proposed that Rhizodus lunged at terrestrial, shorebound prey, just like a modern-day crocodile.\n\n\n== References ==\nHarajicadectes (IPA: [\u02cch\u0251\u02d0\u027e\u0251\u02d0d\u0292\u026ak\u0251\u02d0\u02c8dektes]) (meaning \"Harajica biter\") is a genus of stem-tetrapod from the Givetian to Frasnian Amadeus Basin in Northern Territory, Australia.

Modern forms are excluded from this list. The list currently includes 457 names.\n\n\n== Naming conventions and terminology ==\nNaming conventions and terminology follow the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Technical terms used include:\n\nJunior synonym: A name which describes the same taxon as a previously published name. If two or more genera are formally designated and the type specimens are later assigned to the same genus, the first to be published (in chronological order) is the senior synonym, and all other instances are junior synonyms. Senior synonyms are generally used, except by special decision of the ICZN, but junior synonyms cannot be used again, even if deprecated. Junior synonymy is often subjective, unless the genera described were both based on the same type specimen.\nNomen nudum (Latin for \"naked name\"): A name that has appeared in print but has not yet been formally published by the standards of the ICZN. Nomina nuda (the plural form) are invalid, and are therefore not italicized as a proper generic name would be. If the name is later formally published, that name is no longer a nomen nudum and will be italicized on this list. Often, the formally published name will differ from any nomina nuda that describe the same specimen.\nNomen oblitum (Latin for \"forgotten name\"): A name that has not been used in the scientific community for more than fifty years after its original proposal.\nPreoccupied name: A name that is formally published, but which has already been used for another taxon.

With the exception of one late-surviving lepospondyl from the Late Permian of Morocco (Diplocaulus minimus), lepospondyls lived from the Visean stage of the Early Carboniferous to the Early Permian and were geographically restricted to what is now Europe and North America. Five major groups of lepospondyls are known: Adelospondyli; A\u00efstopoda; Lysorophia; Microsauria; and Nectridea. Lepospondyls have a diverse range of body forms and include species with newt-like, eel- or snake-like, and lizard-like forms. Various species were aquatic, semiaquatic, or terrestrial. None were large (the biggest genus, the diplocaulid Diplocaulus, reached a meter in length, but most were much smaller), and they are assumed to have lived in specialized ecological niches not taken by the more numerous temnospondyl amphibians that coexisted with them in the Paleozoic. \nLepospondyli was named in 1888 by Karl Alfred von Zittel, who coined the name to include some tetrapods from the Paleozoic that shared some specific characteristics in the notochord and teeth. Lepospondyls have sometimes been considered to be either related or ancestral to modern amphibians or to Amniota (the clade containing reptiles and mammals). It has been suggested that the grouping is polyphyletic, with a\u00efstopods being primitive stem-tetrapods, while recumbirostran microsaurs are primitive reptiles.\n\n\n== Description ==\nAll lepospondyls are characterised by having simple, spool-shaped vertebrae that did not ossify from cartilage, but rather grew as bony cylinders around the notochord. In addition, the upper portion of the vertebra, the neural arch, is usually fused to the centrum (the main body of the vertebra).\n\n\n== Classification ==\nThe position of the Lepospondyli within the Tetrapoda is uncertain because the earliest lepospondyls were already highly specialized when they first appeared in the fossil record. Some lepospondyls were once thought to be related or perhaps ancestral to modern salamanders (Urodela), but not the other modern amphibians. This view is no longer held and all modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians) are now grouped within the clade Lissamphibia. For a long time, the Lepospondyli were considered one of the three subclasses of Amphibia, along with the Lissamphibia and the Labyrinthodontia. However, the dissolution of \"labyrinthodonts\" into separate groups such as temnospondyls and anthracosaurs has cast doubt on these traditional amphibian subclasses.  Much like \"Labyrinthodontia\", some studies proposed that Lepospondyli is an artificial (polyphyletic) grouping with some members closely related to extinct stem tetrapod groups and others more closely related to modern amphibians or reptiles. Early phylogenetic analyses conducted in the 1980s and 1990s often maintained the idea that lepospondyls were paraphyletic, with nectrideans close to colosteids and microsaurs close to temnospondyls, which were considered to be ancestral to modern amphibians.\nHowever, a 1995 paper by Robert Carroll argued that lepospondyls were actually a monophyletic group closer to reptiles. Carroll considered them closer to reptiles than the seymouriamorphs, but not as close as the diadectomorphs. Many phylogenetic analyses since Carroll (1995) agreed with his interpretation, including Laurin & Reisz (1997),  Anderson (2001), and Ruta et al. (2003). A few have still considered lepospondyls ancestral to amphibians, but came to this conclusion without changing the position of lepospondyls compared to seymouriamorphs and diadectomorphs.\nLepospondyl and tetrapod classification is still controversial, and even recent studies have had doubts about lepospondyl monophyly. For example, a 2007 paper has suggested that adelospondyls are stem-tetrapods close to colosteids and a 2017 paper on Lethiscus has  A\u00efstopoda in the tetrapod stem based on their primitive braincase. These studies differ in the internal and external relations\nEusthenopteron (from Greek: \u03b5\u1f56 e\u00fb, 'good', Greek: \u03c3\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 sth\u00e9nos, 'strength', and Greek: \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd pteron 'wing' or 'fin') is a genus of prehistoric sarcopterygian (often called \"lobe-finned\") fish known from several species that lived during the Late Devonian period, about 385 million years ago. It has attained an iconic status from its close relationship to tetrapods. Early depictions of animals of this genus show them emerging onto land, but paleontologists now think that eusthenopteron species were strictly aquatic animals, though this is not completely known.\nThe genus was first described by J. F. Whiteaves in 1881, as part of a large collection of fishes from Miguasha, Quebec, Canada. Some 2,000 Eusthenopteron specimens have been collected from Miguasha, one of which was the object of intensely detailed study and several papers by paleoichthyologist Erik Jarvik between the 1940s and the 1990s.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nEusthenopteron is a medium- to large-sized tristichopterid.  The species E. foordi is estimated to have exceeded 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) in length, while the species E. jenkinsi probably reached 2.1 m (6 ft 11 in). Eusthenopteron may have weighed around 50 kilograms.\nThe earliest known fossilized evidence of bone marrow has been found in Eusthenopteron, which may be the origin of bone marrow in tetrapods.Eusthenopteron shares many unique features among fishes but in common with the earliest-known tetrapods. It shares a similar pattern of skull roofing bones with stem tetrapoda forms such as Ichthyostega and Acanthostega. Eusthenopteron, like other tetrapodomorph fishes, had internal nostrils (or a choana), one of the defining traits of tetrapodomorphs, including tetrapods. It also had labyrinthodont teeth, characterized by infolded enamel, which characterizes all of the earliest known tetrapods as well.\nUnlike the early tetrapods, Eusthenopteron did not have larval gills.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nLike other fish-like sarcopterygians, Eusthenopteron possessed a two-part cranium, which hinged at mid-length along an intracranial joint. Eusthenopteron's notoriety comes from the pattern of its fin endoskeleton, which bears a distinct humerus, ulna, and radius in the fore-fin and femur, tibia, and fibula in the pelvic fin. These appendicular long bones had epiphyseal growth plates that allowed substantial longitudinal growth through endochondral ossification, as in tetrapod long bones. These six appendicular bones also occur in tetrapods and are a synapomorphy of a large clade of sarcopterygians, possibly Tetrapodomorpha (the humerus and femur are present in all sarcopterygians). Similarly, its elasmoid scales lack superficial odontodes composed of dentine and enamel; this loss appears to be a synapomorphy with more crownward tetrapodomorphs.\nEusthenopteron differs significantly from some later Carboniferous tetrapods in the apparent absence of a recognized larval stage and a definitive metamorphosis. In even the smallest known specimen of Eusthenopteron foordi, with a length of 29 millimetres (1.1 in), the lepidotrichia cover all of the fins, which does not happen until after metamorphosis in genera like Polydon (the American paddlefish). This might indicate that Eusthenopteron developed directly, with the hatchling already attaining the adult's general body form (Cote et al., 2002).\n\n\n== See also ==\nGogonasus\nTiktaalik \u2013 an even more tetrapod-like sarcopterygian\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nPalaeos.com \u2013 Vertebrates \u2013 Sarcopterygii (archive)\nBaphetidae is an extinct family of stem-tetrapods. Baphetids were large labyrinthodont predators of the Late Carboniferous period (Namurian through Westphalian) of Europe. Fragmentary remains from the Early Carboniferous of Canada have been tentatively assigned to the group. The phylogenetic relationships of baphetids is uncertain; while many studies have placed the group as a close relative of Amniota, other analyses have found Baphetidae to be a more basal clade of early stem tetrapods. Baphetids were among the first of the Carboniferous fossil tetrapods to be found and were originally described in 1850 by John William Dawson. The baphetids have been referred to the family Loxommatidae, but this group was later shown to be a junior synonym of Baphetidae, which was named earlier in 1865. Baphetids are known mainly from skulls; very little postcranial material has been found.\n\n\n== Palaeobiology ==\nThe presence of lateral lines and the long rows of needle-like teeth show that most were fish-eaters.  Their development was likely amphibian, though no larval fossils are known. Their best-known characteristic was a curious, keyhole-shaped orbit formed by excavation of the lacrimal and prefrontal bones in front of the eye.  It has been suggested that this space accommodated a salt gland or some kind of electrosensory organ.  Perhaps the better hypothesis is that the space allowed room for the contraction of an enlarged pterygoideus muscle.  In that case, this skull modification would represent an early form of skull fenestration for jaw muscles.\nThe skull is shallow.  Unlike the better-known embolomeres, the baphetid cheek and skull roof are sutured together.  There is a strongly embayed spiracular (\"otic\") notch, but the stapes is distally broad, which seems to rule out a sensitive hearing apparatus.  The palate is closed\u2014a primitive character, but very different from the temnospondyls.  The coronoids bear no teeth or denticles, while the dentary has a double tooth row.\nSince the taxon is based almost exclusively on skulls, the body is very poorly known.  It is often said that the body was crocodile-like, but this appears to be largely supposition.  \n\nIt is not clear whether all of the genera assigned to this group are really closely related.  The traditional four genera of baphetids (Loxomma, Baphetes, Megalocephalus, and Spathicephalus) have recently been supplemented by Eucritta, a somewhat different form.  It has also been suggested that Crassigyrinus may be closely related.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nBaphetids were first described by Edward Drinker Cope when he erected the family Baphetidae in 1865 for Baphetes. Richard Lydekker named Loxomatinae in 1889 for Loxomma, which later became known as Loxommatidae. D. M. S. Watson described the group as Loxommidae in 1917. Later studies have shown Baphetes and Loxomma to be close relatives within the same family, and because Baphetidae was named before Loxommatidae, it has seniority and is the valid name of the group.\n\n\n=== Phylogeny ===\nBaphetids have been previously considered primitive temnospondyls and more recently batrachosaurs (reptile-like amphibia).   It is likely, however, that they represent one more of a number of early Carboniferous tetrapodomorph radiations.  Computer-assisted phylogenetic analyses of a data matrix using characteristics of most of the major groups of terrestrial vertebrates place the Baphetids close to the ancestry of amniotes.\nWith the reinterpretation of the Ichthyostegalia as aquatic forms, baphetids are good candidates for the spot of first labyrinthodont group to actually spend substantial time on land. If so, baphetids may be a rather important taxon.\n\n\n== References ==\nPanderichthys is a genus of extinct sarcopterygian (lobe-finned fish) from the late Devonian period, about 380 Mya. Panderichthys, which was recovered from Frasnian (early Late Devonian) deposits in Latvia, is represented by two species. P. stolbovi is known only from some snout fragments and an incomplete lower jaw. P. rhombolepis is known from several more complete specimens. Although it probably belongs to a sister group of the earliest tetrapods, Panderichthys exhibits a range of features transitional between tristichopterid lobe-fin fishes (e.g., Eusthenopteron) and early tetrapods. It is named after the German-Baltic paleontologist Christian Heinrich Pander. Possible tetrapod tracks dating back to before the appearance of Panderichthys in the fossil record were reported in 2010, which suggests that Panderichthys is not a direct ancestor of tetrapods, but nonetheless shows the traits that evolved during the fish-tetrapod evolution \n\n\n== Discovery and history ==\nPanderichthys is represented by two different species: Panderichthys rhombolepis and Panderichthys stobolvi. P. rhombolepis was discovered by Gross in 1930 and P. stobolvi was discovered and figured by Emilia Vorobyeva in 1960. P. rhombolepis was discovered in Lode, Latvia within Frasnian deposits and according to P.E. Ahlberg can definitely be found in other Frasnian deposits in Latvia. Although fossils of Panderichthys have been known for a long time, they have only recently been examined in full. The first time they were recognized as being phylogenetically closer to tetrapods than fish was by Shultze and Arsenault in 1985.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nPanderichthys is a 1.5\u20132 m (4 ft 11 in \u2013 6 ft 7 in) long fish with a large tetrapod-like head that is flattened, narrow at the snout and wide in the back. The intracranial joint, which is characteristic of most lobe-fin fishes, has been lost from the external elements of the skull, but is still present in the braincase. The patterns of external bones in the skull roof and cheeks are more similar to those of early tetrapods than those of other lobe-fins. The transitional qualities of Panderichthys are also evident in the rest of the body. It lacks the dorsal and anal fins (fish fin) and its tail is more like those of early tetrapods than the caudal fins of other lobe-fins. The shoulders exhibit several tetrapod-like features, while the humerus is longer than those found in other lobe-fins. The vertebral column is ossified throughout its length and the vertebrae are comparable to those of early tetrapods. On the other hand, the distal parts of the front fins are unlike those of tetrapods. As would be expected from a fin, there are numerous lepidotrichia (long and thin fin rays).\nPanderichthys has many features that can be considered an intermediate form during the fish-tetrapod evolution and displays some features that are more derived than its phylogenetic position indicates, while others that are more basal. The body form of Panderichthys and Tiktaalik represents a major step in the transition from fish to tetrapods and they were even able to haul out on land. According to Shultze and Trueb, Panderichthys shares ten features with tetrapods:\n\nThe skull roof is flat compared to fish skulls.\nThe orbits are more dorsal and lie closer together.\nThe external naris is close to the margin of the upper jaw.\nFrontals are paired.\nThere is no external intracranial joint.\nThe parietal bone is located between the orbits and main portion posterior to orbits.\nIn  P. rhombolepis, the squamosal touches the maxilla (varies among specimens though).\nThe teeth have a complex polyplocodont structure.\nA lack of median fins.\nIn panderichthyids and Ichthyostega, the ribs are attached to the neural arch and there is an intercentrum.\n\n\n=== Humerus ===\nOne of the key transitional features of Panderichthys is its humerus. During the transition from fish to tetrapods the limbs began to move and became located at a right angle to the body rather than be\nGaiasia is an extinct genus of stem-tetrapods from the Early Permian of Namibia, containing a single species, Gaiasia jennyae. Gaiasia was a freshwater predator which was exceptional among stem-tetrapods for its combination of relatively enormous size, Southern occurrence, and late survival.\nGaiasia is known from three fossil specimens, including an incomplete skeleton with a crushed skull and partial vertebral column. Though limb material is not preserved, the skull of Gaiasia indicates that its affinities lie with digit-bearing stem-tetrapods (early amphibians, in the broad sense). It was a close relative to the colosteids, a family of aquatic stem-tetrapods with long bodies and small limbs. Most digit-bearing stem-tetrapods, including the colosteids, go extinct by the Carboniferous rainforest collapse near the end of the preceding Carboniferous Period. Gaiasia is one of the few to survive into the Permian alongside crown-tetrapods (the groups directly ancestral to living amphibians, mammals, and reptiles).\nGaiasia is the largest known digit-bearing stem-tetrapods, with an estimated maximum skull length reaching 60 centimetres (24 in). It was found in the Gai-As Formation, a rock unit corresponding to cold temperate lake environments located near the South Pole (around 55\u00b0 South) in the Permian. Other digit-bearing stem tetrapods were significantly smaller (skulls under 40 centimetres (16 in) in length), and nearly all were restricted to the tropics of Euramerica, a low-latitude region equivalent to present-day Europe and North America. Gaiasia hints that stem-tetrapods in Southern latitudes continued to persist and evolve through the Late Paleozoic icehouse interval, even as low-latitude species died out and were supplanted by crown-tetrapods. Gaiasia's genus name references the Gai-As Formation, while the species name honors the late Jenny Clack, an expert in early tetrapods.\n\n\n== Description ==\nGaiasia has a broad flattened skull, large keeled branchial elements (throat or gill bones), a reinforced neck, and massive interlocking fangs at the front of the snout. Together these traits indicate that it was well-adapted for both suction feeding and a strong bite. The front edge of the snout is not fully preserved, but the profile of the skull shows that the snout is short and boxy. The bones of the skull roof are thin and ornamented by radiating ridges and grooves. A pineal foramen is absent, but lateral line canals are well-developed and a small intertemporal bone is present. Most unique features relate to the palate (roof of the mouth). The parasphenoid bone (which forms the floor of the braincase) is large and wide, with a blunt front tip, but the interpterygoid vacuities (large holes which flank the parasphenoid) are narrow. The paired bones at the front of the palate have large fangs: two fangs on each vomer, one per palatine, and one per ectopterygoid. Each fang is paired with a large pit which hosts developing replacement teeth.\nThe lower jaw is rather thin and smoothly curved at the front, but thickens further back and extends past the jaw joint. Several fangs occur at the front of the lower jaw, with three on each side (six in total). Two of the three fangs are adjacent to the symphysis (the point where the two sides of the jaw converge at the middle). These two fangs are hosted by the adsymphyseal and dentary bones. The largest fang is located a bit further back, on an enlarged first coronoid bone which swells inwards from the rim of the jaw. The neck joint is a strong hinge, formed from the contact between a pair of exoccipital condyles (rounded surfaces on the braincase) and a partially fused atlas-axis complex (the first few neck vertebrae). Paired exoccipital condyles have convergently evolved in a number of crown-tetrapod lineages (lissamphibians, stereospondyls, some \"lepospondyls\", and mammals), none of which are related to Gaiasia. On the edge of the braincase, a spur of bone divides the spiracular cleft (a \nEmbolomeri is an order of tetrapods or stem-tetrapods, possibly members of Reptiliomorpha. Embolomeres first evolved in the Early Carboniferous (Mississippian) Period and were the largest and most successful predatory tetrapods of the Late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) Period. They were specialized semiaquatic predators with long bodies for eel-like undulatory swimming. Embolomeres are characterized by their vertebral centra, which are formed by two cylindrical segments, the pleurocentrum at the rear and intercentrum at the front. These segments are equal in size. Most other tetrapods have pleurocentra and intercentra which are drastically different in size and shape.\nEmbolomeres were among the earliest large carnivorous tetrapods, with members such as the crocodilian-like Proterogyrinus appearing in the Visean stage of the Carboniferous. They declined in diversity during the Permian period, though at least one representative (Archeria) was common in the Early Permian. Embolomeres went extinct shortly before the end of the Permian.\n\n\n== Classification ==\n\nThe order Embolomeri was first named by Edward Drinker Cope in 1884 during his revision of \"batrachian\" (amphibian) evolution. Embolomeri was differentiated from several other newly named amphibian orders, such as \"Rachitomi\", by the presence of intercentra and pleurocentra of the same size and shape, that being large cylinders. At the time, embolomere fossils were uncommon, so Cope could only identify \"cricotids\" such as Cricotus as possessing embolomerous vertebrae. The genus name \"Cricotus\" is dubious, as it has been used by Cope to refer to embolomere fossils spanning anywhere between mid-Pennsylvanian deposits of Illinois and the Permian red beds of Texas. Most paleontologists now refer the red bed \"Cricotus\" specimens to the genus Archeria.\nMichel Laurin (1998) formally defined Embolomeri as \"the last common ancestor of Proterogyrinus and Archeria and all of its descendants.\" This definition excludes Eoherpeton, which is almost always considered a close ally of the group. Some authors place Silvanerpeton or chroniosuchians as close relatives as well, though they are generally agreed to lie outside Embolomeri proper.\nThe poorly-defined group Anthracosauria is sometimes considered synonymous with Embolomeri, and the group's namesake, Anthracosaurus, is an embolomere. However, other authors use the term \"Anthracosauria\" in reference to a broader group which includes embolomeres in combination with various other reptile-like amphibians (reptiliomorphs). Reptiliomorphs are all tetrapods more closely related to living reptiles and synapsids (mammals and their ancestors), rather than living amphibians. Despite this, reptiliomorphs likely had amphibian-like biological traits, such as water-based reproduction.\nMany studies conducted since the 1990s have also placed the group Lepospondyli as closer to amniotes than embolomeres were. Lepospondyls are a particularly unusual group of tetrapods, with some members (i.e. brachystelechids) very similar to lissamphibians and others (i.e. tuditanids) very similar to amniotes. If lepospondyls are both close relatives of amniotes and the ancestors of modern amphibians, then that means that crown-Tetrapoda (descendants of the common ancestor to all living tetrapods) is a much more restricted group than previously assumed. In this situation, various traditional orders of Tetrapoda such as Embolomeri and Temnospondyli actually would qualify as stem-tetrapods due to having evolved prior to the split between modern amphibians and amniotes.\nHowever, most authors consider temnospondyls to be the ancestors of modern amphibians. This would suggest that embolomeres are likely reptiliomorphs (closer to reptiles) and within the clade Tetrapoda. However, even this classification is not stable, as some analyses have found embolomeres to be more basal than temnospondyls.\nBelow is a cladogram from Ruta et al. (2003):\n\n\n== Genera ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\"Labyrinthodontia\" (Greek, 'maze-toothed') is an informal grouping of extinct predatory amphibians which were major components of ecosystems in the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras (about 390 to 150 million years ago). Traditionally considered a subclass of the class Amphibia, modern classification systems recognize that labyrinthodonts are not a formal natural group (clade) exclusive of other tetrapods. Instead, they consistute an evolutionary grade (a paraphyletic group), ancestral to living tetrapods such as lissamphibians (modern amphibians) and amniotes (reptiles, mammals, and kin). \"Labyrinthodont\"-grade vertebrates evolved from lobe-finned fishes in the Devonian, though a formal boundary between fish and amphibian is difficult to define at this point in time.\n\"Labyrinthodont\" generally refers to extinct four-limbed tetrapods with a large body size and a crocodile-like lifestyle. The name describes the pattern of infolding of the dentin and enamel of the teeth, which are often the only part of the creatures that fossilize. They are also distinguished by a broad, strongly-built skull roof composed of many small heavily-textured skull bones. \"Labyrinthodonts\" generally have complex multi-part vertebrae, and several classification schemes have utilized vertebrae to define subgroups.\nBecause labyrinthodonts do not form a monophyletic group, many modern researchers have abandoned the term. However, some have continued to use the group in their classifications, at least informally, pending more detailed study of their relationships. Many authors prefer to simply use the term tetrapod, while others have re-defined the previously obsolete term Stegocephalia (\"roof heads\") as a cladistic alternative to \"Labyrinthodontia\" or \"Tetrapoda\".\n\n\n== Labyrinthodont traits ==\n\nThe labyrinthodonts flourished for more than 200 million years. Particularly the early forms exhibited a lot of variation, yet there are still a few basic anatomical traits that make their fossils very distinct and easily recognizable in the field:\n\nStrongly folded tooth surface, involving infolding of the dentin and enamel of the teeth. The cross section resembles a classical labyrinth (or maze), hence the name of the group.\nMassive skull roof, with openings only for the nostrils, eyes and a parietal eye, similar to the structure of the \"anapsid\" reptiles.

In earlier fully aquatic forms such as Ichthyostega, it may have formed an open spiracle. In later terrestrial forms such as Seymouria, it may possibly have held a tympanic membrane (eardrum).\nComplex vertebrae made of multiple components: an intercentrum (wedge-shaped front lower piece), two pleurocentra (upper rear piece), and a vertebral arch/spine (upper projection). The relative development and shape of the elements is highly variable.\n\n\n== The labyrinthodonts in life ==\n\n\n=== General build ===\nLabyrinthodonts were generally amphibian-like in build. They were short-legged and mostly large headed, with moderately short to long tails. Many groups, and all the early forms, were large animals. Primitive members of all labyrinthodont groups were probably true water predators, and various degrees of amphibious, semi-aquatic and semi terrestrial modes of living arose independently in different groups. Some lineages remained waterbound or became secondarily fully aquatic with reduced limbs and elongated, eel-like bodies.\n\n\n=== Skull ===\n\nWith the exception of the snake-like a\u00efstopods, the skulls of labyrinthodonts were massive.

Rhizodonts lived in tropical rivers and freshwater lakes and were the dominant predators of their age. They reached huge sizes - the largest known species, Rhizodus hibberti from Europe and North America, was an estimated 7 m in length, making it the largest freshwater fish known.\n\n\n== Description ==\n \nThe upper jaw had a marginal row of small teeth on the maxilla and premaxilla, medium-sized fangs on the ectopterygoid and dermopalatine bones, and large tusks on the vomers and premaxillae. On the lower jaw were marginal teeth on the dentary, with fangs on the three coronoids and a huge tusk at the symphysial tip of the dentary. Apparently, the left and right mandibles rotated inwards towards each other on biting. This may have been a kinetic mechanism to dig the marginal teeth more deeply into the prey, to help grip slippery or struggling items.\nThe trunk was elongated, with pelvic, two dorsal and anal fins much reduced and placed posteriorly The anal and second dorsal fins formed a functional part of the tail. The lateral line system was elaborated on the skull and pectoral girdle - in Strepsodus the main trunk lateral line also had several subsidiary lines running parallel to it. This probably helped rhizodonts detect prey in the turbid, swampy environments where they lived.\nRhizodont pelvic fins are known only from external morphology. They are smaller than the pectoral fins and positioned toward the rear of the body. In comparison to the other fins, the pectoral fins were much enlarged. They had a well-developed internal skeleton surrounded by robust, largely unsegmented lepidotrichia; the whole fin was then covered in deeply overlapping scales. This turned the pectoral fin into a broad paddle.\n\n\n== Phylogeny ==\nThe cladogram presented below is based on a 2021 study by Clement and colleagues:\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nJudging from their anatomy, rhizodonts had an extremely powerful bite. They probably employed a 'grip and drag' hunting technique, where prey was ambushed, the tusks sunk in to secure it, and then depending on its size, either thrashed on the surface to subdue it, or dragged to where the rhizodont could consume it without being disturbed. Their prey probably included large sharks, lungfish, and other lobe-finned fishes, and even tetrapods, because all tetrapods at this time still had to lay their eggs in water.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nJohanson, Z. & Ahlberg, P.E.

The species epithet H. lindae is derived from the name of the wife of Keith Stewart Thomson, who described this fish.\n\n\n== Description ==\nHyneria was a large fish. H. lindae is estimated around 2.5\u20133 metres (8.2\u20139.8 ft) in total length. An isolated cleithrum AM 6545 likely belongs to an individual of at least 2.7 metres (8.9 ft) in length. The largest complete jaw reaches 38 centimetres (15 in), but there is much larger fragment possibly from a jaw about twice that length, although that specimen may belong to a rhizodont instead. Assuming this jaw fragment does pertain to Hyneria, and assuming proportions similar to more complete tristichopterids, it suggests H. lindae could possibly reach lengths up to 3.5 metres (11 ft). A second species, H. uldezinye, was once estimated as having a length of between 2 and 4 metres (6.6 and 13.1 ft) before being described. However, the species description estimates that the largest specimen belongs to an animal about 3 metres (9.8 ft). Its skull had heavy, ornamented dermal bones and its lower jaw was relatively long and shallow. The teeth were stout, with those of the premaxilla forming fangs upwards of 5 cm (2 in). Its body was covered by cycloid scales. It had large sensory canals to aid in detection of possible prey, as the freshwater environment it inhabited likely was murky and had low visibility. Adult individuals retained juvenile features (i.e. partially unossified skeletons), suggesting that they were likely neotenic.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\n\nThe original fossils came from two localities in Pennsylvania, United States, one found between the villages of North Bend and Hyner and another near Emporium. They consisted of a disarticulated partial skull and fragments of the shoulder girdle. The fossils were found in the Catskill Formation of the Red Hill Shale, dating to the upper Devonian. These were the only remains known until 1993 when a renewed collecting effort discovered abundant new material. Hyneria is considered the largest and most common lobe-finned fish found in the Red Hill Shale. In February 2023 a second species of Hyneria, H. udlezinye, was named from remains discovered in the Waterloo Farm lagerst\u00e4tte. These remains include the skull and shoulder girdle.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHyneria Archived 2008-05-11 at the Wayback Machine at Devonian Times\nThe Zachelmie trackways are a series of Middle Devonian-age trace fossils in Poland, purportedly the oldest evidence of terrestrial vertebrates (tetrapods) in the fossil record. These trackways were discovered in the Wojciechowice Formation, an Eifelian-age carbonate unit exposed in the Zache\u0142mie Quarry of the \u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Mountains (Holy Cross Mountains). The discovery of these tracks has complicated the study of tetrapod evolution. Morphological studies suggest that four-limbed vertebrates (\"tetrapods\" in the broad sense, also known as stegocephalians) are descended from a specialized type of tetrapodomorph fish, the epistostegalians. This hypothesis was supported further by the discovery and 2006 description of Tiktaalik, a well-preserved epistostegalian from the Frasnian of Nunavut. Crucial to this idea is the assumption that tetrapods originated in the Late Devonian, after elpistostegalians appear in the fossil record near the start of the Frasnian. The Zachelmie trackways, however, appear to demonstrate that tetrapods were present prior to the Late Devonian. The implications of this find has led to several different perspectives on the sequence of events involved in tetrapod evolution.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\n\nIn January 2010, a group of paleontologists published a paper which showed that the first tetrapods appeared long before any know fossils of Tiktaalik or other elpistostegids. This paper was accompanied by extensive supplementary material and also discussed in a Nature documentary on the origin of tetrapods.  Their conclusions were based on numerous trackways (esp. Muz. PGI 1728.II.16) and individual footprints (esp. Muz. PGI 1728.II.1) discovered at the Zache\u0142mie quarry.\nA tetrapod origin of those tracks was suggested based on:\n\nDistinct digits and limb morphology;\nTrackways reflecting quadrupedal gait and diagonal walk;\nNo body or tail drag marks;\nVery wide stride in relation to body length (much beyond that of Tiktaalik or any other fish);\nVarious size footprints with some unusually big (up to 26 cm wide) indicating body lengths of over 2.5 m.\nTrack-bearing layers were assigned to the lower-middle Eifelian based on conodont index fossil samples (costatus Zone) and \"previous biostratigraphic data obtained from the underlying and overlying strata\" with subsequent studies confirming this dating. The Eifelian stage is the first stage of the Middle Devonian, more than 10 million years older than the Frasnian-age Tiktaalik. It is far older than any known tetrapod fossils, and even older than most fossils of tetrapodomorph fish.\nA reanalysis by Martin Qvarnstr\u00f6m, Piotr Szrek, Per Ahlberg, and Grzegorz Nied\u017awiedzki, of the paleoenvironment of the Zachelmie trackways were reinterpreted as \"a succession of ephemeral lakes with a restricted and non-marine biota, rather than a marginal marine environment as originally thought\". This shows that the purported tetrapods associated with the trackways were likely capable of terrestrial locomotion.\n\n\n== Implications for tetrapod evolution ==\n\nTiktaalik's discoverers were skeptical about the Zachelmie trackways. Daeschler said that trace evidence was not enough for him to modify the theory of tetrapod evolution, while Shubin argued that Tiktaalik could have produced very similar footprints. In a later study Shubin expressed a significantly modified opinion that some of the Zachelmie footprints, those which lacked digits, may have been made by walking fish. However, Ahlberg insisted that those tracks could not have possibly been formed either by natural processes or by transitional species such as Tiktaalik or Panderichthys. Instead, the authors of the publication suggested that \"ichthyostegalian\"-grade tetrapods were the responsible trackmakers, based on available pes morphology of those animals. However, a paper published in 2015 that undertook a critical review of Devonian tetrapod footprints called into question the designation of the Zachelmie marks and instead suggested an origin\nCrassigyrinus (from Latin: crassus, 'thick' and Greek: \u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 Greek: gyr\u00ednos, 'tadpole') is an extinct genus of carnivorous stem tetrapod from the Early Carboniferous Limestone Coal Group of Scotland and possibly Greer, West Virginia. \n\n\n== Discovery ==\nThe type specimen was originally described as Macromerium scoticum and lacked a complete skull. With subsequent discoveries, Crassigyrinus is now known from three skulls, one of which is in articulation with a fairly complete skeleton, and two incomplete lower jaws. Crassigyrinus grew up to 2 meters in length, coupled with tiny limbs and unusually large jaws. Crassigyrinus is taxonomically enigmatic, having confused paleontologists for decades with its apparent fish-like and tetrapod features. It was traditionally placed within the group Labyrinthodontia along with many other early tetrapods. Some paleontologists have even considered it as the most basal crown group tetrapod, while others hesitate to even place it within the Tetrapoda superclass.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nCrassigyrinus had a streamlined body up to 2 meters in length. Its limbs were tiny and virtually useless, implying that the animal was almost completely aquatic. Crassigyrinus had unusually large jaws, equipped with two rows of sharp teeth, the second row having a pair of palatal fangs. Studies have shown that Crassigyrinus may have been able to open its mouth as wide as 60 degrees, which suggests that it was a powerful predator with a strong bite. This strongly suggests that it was ideally suited for catching fish, and the animal was probably a fast-moving predator.\n\nSeveral thickened bony ridges ran along the dorsal midline of the snout and between the eyes, and several paleontologists have suggested that they helped the skull to withstand stress when the animal bit prey. Crassigyrinus had large eyes, suggesting that it was either nocturnal, or lived in very murky water. It possessed large otic (spiracular) notches, probably accommodating a spiracle rather than a tympanic membrane.\nIts peculiar stunted forelimbs were tiny and the humerus was only 35 mm long (the whole animal was about 1.5 m long). Various foramina on the humeral surfaces are very similar to those seen in Ichthyostega, Acanthostega, and lobe-finned fishes like Eusthenopteron. The hindlimbs were much larger than the forelimbs, and in the pelvis the ilium lacked a bony connection to the vertebral column (a classic feature of aquatic tetrapods). Although there is evidence that the Crassigyrinus eventually lost its limbs, there is counterevidence in that it used its limbs for movement, as proven by healing in the bones in case of injury. The fact that there is a need to heal the limbs must mean there was an importance of the limbs at some point, and was then lost. The tail, only known from a few vertebrae fragments, is assumed to have been long and laterally compressed.\nA crushed skull from the Dora bonebed near Cowdenbeath was described by Panchen (1985). The skull was redescribed by Porro et al. (2023), based on a digital reconstruction derived from CT scans. The 1985 reconstruction of the skull was much taller and narrower than in most early tetrapods, though the 2023 reconstruction is relatively low and broad.\n\n\n== Paleobiology ==\nCrassygyrinus was an aquatic predator. It was capable of opening its jaws widely at a 60-degree angle, with a powerful bite with rapid jaw closure, allowing it to grasp and consume relatively large prey items.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCrassigyrinus\nReptiliomorpha (meaning reptile-shaped; in PhyloCode known as Pan-Amniota) is a clade containing the amniotes and those tetrapods that share a more recent common ancestor with amniotes than with living amphibians (lissamphibians). It was defined by Michel Laurin (2001) and Vallin and Laurin (2004) as the largest clade that includes Homo sapiens, but not Ascaphus truei (tailed frog). Laurin and Reisz (2020) defined Pan-Amniota as the largest total clade containing Homo sapiens, but not Pipa pipa, Caecilia tentaculata, and Siren lacertina.\nThe informal variant of the name, \"reptiliomorphs\", is also occasionally used to refer to stem-amniotes, i.e. a grade of reptile-like tetrapods that are more closely related to amniotes than they are to lissamphibians, but are not amniotes themselves; the name is used in this meaning e.g. by Ruta, Coates and Quicke (2003). An alternative name, \"Anthracosauria\", is also commonly used for the group, but is confusingly also used for a more primitive grade of reptiliomorphs (Embolomeri) by Benton. While both anthracosaurs and/or embolomeres are suggested to be reptiliomorphs closer to amniotes, some recent studies either retain them as amphibians or argue that their relationships are still ambiguous and are more likely to be stem-tetrapods.\nAs the exact phylogenetic position of Lissamphibia within Tetrapoda remains uncertain, it also remains controversial which fossil tetrapods are more closely related to amniotes than to lissamphibians, and thus, which ones of them were reptiliomorphs in any meaning of the word. The two major hypotheses for lissamphibian origins are that they are either descendants of dissorophoid temnospondyls or microsaurian \"lepospondyls\". If the former (the \"temnospondyl hypothesis\") is true, then Reptiliomorpha includes all tetrapod groups that are closer to amniotes than to temnospondyls. These include the diadectomorphs, seymouriamorphs, most or all \"lepospondyls\", gephyrostegids, and possibly the embolomeres and chroniosuchians. In addition, several \"anthracosaur\" genera of uncertain taxonomic placement would also probably qualify as reptiliomorphs, including Solenodonsaurus, Eldeceeon, Silvanerpeton, and Casineria. However, if lissamphibians originated among the lepospondyls according to the \"lepospondyl hypothesis\", then Reptiliomorpha refers to groups that are closer to amniotes than to lepospondyls. Few non-amniote groups would count as reptiliomorphs under this definition, although the diadectomorphs are among those that qualify.\n\n\n== Changing definitions ==\nThe name Reptiliomorpha was coined by Professor Gunnar S\u00e4ve-S\u00f6derbergh in 1934 to designate amniotes and various types of late Paleozoic tetrapods that were more closely related to amniotes than to living amphibians. In his view, the amphibians had evolved from fish twice, with one group composed of the ancestors of modern salamanders and the other, which S\u00e4ve-S\u00f6derbergh referred to as Eutetrapoda, consisting of anurans (frogs), amniotes, and their ancestors, with the origin of caecilians being uncertain. S\u00e4ve-S\u00f6derbergh's Eutetrapoda consisted of two sister-groups: Batrachomorpha, containing anurans and their ancestors, and Reptiliomorpha, containing anthracosaurs and amniotes. S\u00e4ve-S\u00f6derbergh subsequently added Seymouriamorpha to his Reptiliomorpha as well.\nAlfred Sherwood Romer rejected S\u00e4ve-S\u00f6derbergh's theory of a biphyletic amphibia and used the name Anthracosauria to describe the \"labyrinthodont\" lineage from which amniotes evolved. In 1970, the German paleontologist Alec Panchen took up S\u00e4ve-S\u00f6derbergh's name for this group as having priority, but Romer's terminology is still in use, e.g. by Carroll (1988 and 2002) and by Hildebrand & Goslow (2001). Some writers preferring phylogenetic nomenclature use Anthracosauria.\nIn 1956, Friedrich von Huene included both amphibians and anapsid reptiles in the Reptiliomorpha. This included the following orders: Anthracosauria, Seymouriamorpha, Microsauria, Diadectomo\nThe Batrachomorpha (\"frog forms\") are a clade containing extant and extinct amphibians that are more closely related to modern amphibians than they are to mammals and reptiles (including birds). According to many analyses they include the extinct Temnospondyli; some show that they include the Lepospondyli instead. The name traditionally indicated a more limited group.\nThe first tetrapods were all amphibians in the physiological sense that they laid their eggs in water, and are colloquially sometimes referred to as labyrinthodonts or stegocephalians. The term \"amphibians\" can be ambiguous, however. In modern phylogeny, the basalmost tetrapods are discerned from two derived branches, one consisting of the crown group of modern amphibians, the Lissamphibia, and its relatives. In this scheme, the name Batrachomorpha is given to this branch of amphibians, while the name Reptiliomorpha denotes the other branch. While the actual phylogeny of the modern amphibians is not well understood, their ancestors are descended from one line of batrachomorphs. All other living tetrapods (reptiles, birds and mammals) are descended from one branch of reptiliomorphs, the amniotes. Amniotes achieved dominance, while all other reptiliomorphs and most batrachomorphs have gone extinct.\n\n\n== Classification ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe name Batrachomorpha was coined by the Swedish palaeontologist Gunnar S\u00e4ve-S\u00f6derbergh in 1934 to refer to ichthyostegids, temnospondyls, anthracosaurs, and the frogs. S\u00e4ve-S\u00f6derbergh held the view that salamanders and caecilians are not related to the other tetrapods, but had developed independently from a different group of lobe-finned fish, the porolepiformes. In this view amphibians would be a biphyletic group, and Batrachomorpha was erected to form a natural group consisting of the \"true amphibians\" (i.e. frogs in S\u00e4ve-S\u00f6derberghs view) and their fossil relatives. The salamanders and the Lepospondyli was consigned to \"Urodelomorpha\".\nFriedrich von Huene adopted it as a superorder of his subclass \"Eutetrapoda\" (the lower tetrapods exclusive of the urodeles) and included the orders Stegocephalia (here including a number of Labyrinthodonts) and Anura. Erik Jarvik, who took over S\u00e4ve-S\u00f6derberghs work and shared his view of the origin of salamanders, used the term more informally, but in a wider sense, to include the ancestral osteolepiform fishes.\nThough never a majority view, the notion that tetrapods had evolved twice, together with the usage of the term batrachomorpha, lingered until genetic analysis started confirming the monophyly of living amphibians in the 1990s. Jarviks classification is no longer followed, all living amphibians and their fossil relatives now being classified together in the group Lissamphibia.\n\n\n=== Phylogenetics ===\n\nMichael Benton adopted the term Batrachomorpha to include all living amphibians and extinct relatives more closely related to amphibians than to amniotes. In his scheme, Batrachomorpha is a superorder of amphibious tetrapods containing the following subgroups:\n\nSuperorder Batrachomorpha\n\u2020Order Edopoidea\n\u2020Family Dendrerpetonidae\nOrder unnamed\n\u2020Suborder Dvinosauria\n\u2020Family Branchiosauridae\n\u2020Family Dissorophidae\nInfraclass Lissamphibia\n\u2020Family Albanerpetonidae\nOrder Gymnophiona (extant )\nOrder Urodela (extant )\nOrder Anura (extant )\n\u2020Order unnamed\n\u2020Family \u2020Eryopidae\n\u2020Family Actinodontidae\n\u2020Family Archegosauridae\n\u2020Family Rhinesuchidae\n\u2020Suborder Capitosauria\n\u2020Suborder Trematosauria\n\u2020Family Trematosauridae\n\u2020Family Metoposauridae\n\u2020Family Plagiosauridae\n\u2020Family Rhytidosteidae\n\u2020Family Brachyopidae\n\u2020Family Chigutisauridae\nThe other groups of tetrapods considered more closely related to amniotes are put in the superorder Reptiliomorpha.\nThe phylogenetic relationships of Paleozoic tetrapods have not yet been worked out with certainty, and the validity of Batrachomorpha as a clade depends on where other amphibians and early amniotes fit on the evolutionary tree. The actual content of Batrachomorpha \nPederpes (\"Peter's Foot\") is an extinct genus of early Carboniferous tetrapod, dating from 348 to 347.6 Ma in the Tournaisian age (lower Mississippian). Pederpes contains one species, P. finneyae, 1 m long.\nThis most basal Carboniferous tetrapod had a large, somewhat triangular head, similar to that of later American sister-genus Whatcheeria, from which it is distinguished by various skeletal features, such as a spike-like latissimus dorsi (an arm muscle) attachment on the humerus and several minor skull features. The feet had characteristics that distinguished it from the paddle-like feet of the Devonian Ichthyostegalia and resembled the feet of later, more terrestrially adapted Carboniferous forms. Pederpes is the earliest-known tetrapod to show the beginnings of terrestrial locomotion and despite the probable presence of a sixth digit on the forelimbs it was at least functionally pentadactyl.\n\n\n== Discovery and classification ==\n\nPederpes was discovered in 1971 in central Scotland and classified as a lobe-finned fish. Its fossils were found in the Ballagan Formation. The type specimen was a nearly complete, articulated skeleton. Only the tail and some bones of the skull and limbs were missing. It was not until 2002 that Jennifer Clack named and reclassified the fossil as a primitive tetrapod.\nPederpes is placed in the family Whatcheeriidae, of uncertain relationships to other tetrapod families. While an amphibian in the broad sense, under cladistic taxonomy, Pederpes is not a member of the crown group amphibian in the meaning of modern amphibians. As a very basal (primitive) tetrapod, it falls under the traditional class Amphibia in Linnaean taxonomy.\nPederpes is an important fossil because it comes from the period known as Romer's gap and provides biologists with rare information about the development of tetrapods in a time when terrestrial life was rare.\nThe fossil was discovered in the Ballagan Formation, Inverclyde Group, claviger-macra (CM) palynozone (348 to 347.6 mya), Tournaisain Tn3c, Courceyan, Dinantian, Lower Carboniferous.\n\n\n== Anatomy and lifestyle ==\n\nPederpes was 1 m long, making it average-sized for an early tetrapod.\nThe shape of the skull and the fact that the feet face forward rather than outward indicate that Pederpes was well adapted to land life. It is currently the earliest known fully terrestrial animal, although the structure of the ear shows that its hearing was still much more functional underwater than on land, and may have spent much of its time in the water and could have hunted there.\nThe narrow skull suggests that Pederpes breathed by inhaling with a muscular action like most modern tetrapods, rather than by pumping air into the lungs with a throat pouch the way many modern amphibians do.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTaxonomicon entry for Pederpes\nTaxonomicon entry for P. finneyae\nAbstract of description\nNational Geographic News article on 2002 identification of Pederpes fossil\nDixon, Dougal.The World Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Creatures. Anness Publishing Ltd. London, UK: 2007.\nAistopoda (Greek for \"[having] not-visible feet\") is an order of highly specialised snake-like stegocephalians known from the Carboniferous and Early Permian of Europe and North America, ranging from tiny forms only 5 centimetres (2 in), to nearly 1 metre (3.3 ft) in length.  They first appear in the fossil record in the Mississippian period and continue through to the Early Permian.\nThe skull is small but very specialised, with large orbits, and large fenestrae. The primitive form Ophiderpeton has a pattern of dermal bones in the skull similar in respects to the temnospondyls. But in the advanced genus Phlegethontia the skull is very light and open, reduced to a series of struts supporting the braincase against the lower jaw, just as in snakes, and it is possible that the aistopods filled the same ecological niches in the Paleozoic that snakes do today.\n\nThey had an extremely elongated body, with up to 230 vertebrae. The vertebrae were holospondylous, having only a single ossification per segment.  They lacked intercentra, even in the tail, and had are no free haemal arches.  The neural arch was low and fused to the centrum. All of these features are very similar to those of the Nectridea, both representing the typical lepospondylous condition.\nA recent paper described the internal organization of the aistopod head, finding that a\u00efstopods retained many fish-like features of the skull and brain, including a persistent extension of the notochord into the head and an open canal between the pituitary gland and the mouth. Because these features are lost early in tetrapod evolution, this may be evidence that aistopods diverged from other tetrapods soon after the origin of digits.\nThe ribs were slender, either single or double-headed, with the head shaped like a letter \"K\".  There is no trace of limbs or even limb girdles in any known fossil, and the tail was short and primitive.\n\n\n== Relationships ==\nEvolutionary relationships with other early tetrapods remain controversial, as even the earliest aistopod, the Vis\u00e9an species Lethiscus stocki, was already highly specialised, although its skull was primitive and extremely fishlike. A\u00efstopods have been variously grouped with other lepospondyls, or placed at or prior to the batrachomorph-reptiliomorph divide. However, a cladistic analysis by Pardo et al. (2017) recovered Aistopoda at the base of Tetrapoda. The group was quite diverse during the Late Carboniferous, with a few forms continuing through to the Permian.\nBelow is a cladogram from Anderson et al. (2003) showing the phylogenetic relationships of aistopods:\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBenton, M. J. (2000), Vertebrate Paleontology, 2nd ed.
