{"page_content": "London is the capital and largest city of both England and the United Kingdom, with a population of 8,866,180 in 2022. The wider metropolitan area is the largest in Western Europe, with a population of 14.9 million. London stands on the River Thames in southeast England, at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea, and has been a major settlement for nearly 2,000 years. Its ancient core and financial centre, the City of London, was founded by the Romans as Londinium and has retained its medieval boundaries. The City of Westminster, to the west of the City of London, has been the centuries-long host of the national government and parliament. London grew rapidly in the 19th century, becoming the world's largest city at the time. Since the 19th century, the name \"London\" has referred to the metropolis around the City of London, historically split between the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which since 1965 has largely comprised the administrative area of Greater London, governed by 33 local authorities and the Greater London Authority. \nAs one of the world's major global cities, London exerts a strong influence on world art, entertainment, fashion, commerce, finance, education, healthcare, media, science, technology, tourism, transport, and communications. Despite a post-Brexit exodus of stock listings from the London Stock Exchange, London remains Europe's most economically powerful city and one of the world's major financial centres. It hosts Europe's largest concentration of higher education institutions, some of which are the highest-ranked academic institutions in the world: Imperial College London in natural and applied sciences, the London School of Economics in social sciences, and the comprehensive University College London. It is the most visited city in Europe and has the world's busiest city airport system. The London Underground is the world's oldest rapid transit system.\nLondon's diverse cultures encompass over 300 languages. The 2023 population of Greater London of just under 10 million made it Europe's third-most populous city, accounting for 13.4% of the United Kingdom's population and over 16% of England's population. The Greater London Built-up Area is the fourth-most populous in Europe, with about 9.8 million inhabitants as of 2011. The London metropolitan area is the third-most populous in Europe, with about 14 million inhabitants as of 2016,  making London a megacity.\nFour World Heritage Sites are located in London: Kew Gardens; the Tower of London; the site featuring the Palace of Westminster, Church of St. Margaret, and Westminster Abbey; and the historic settlement in Greenwich where the Royal Observatory defines the prime meridian (0\u00b0 longitude) and Greenwich Mean Time. Other landmarks include Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, Piccadilly Circus, St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge, and Trafalgar Square. The city has the most museums, art galleries, libraries, and cultural venues in the UK, including the British Museum, National Gallery, Natural History Museum, Tate Modern, British Library, and numerous West End theatres. Important sporting events held in London include the FA Cup Final, the Wimbledon Tennis Championships, and the London Marathon. It became the first city to host three Summer Olympic Games upon hosting the 2012 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\n\nLondon is an ancient name, attested in the first century AD, usually in the Latinised form Londinium. Modern scientific analyses of the name must account for the origins of the different forms found in early sources: Latin (usually Londinium), Old English (usually Lunden), and Welsh (usually Llundein), with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages. It is agreed that the name came into these languages from Common Brythonic; recent work tends to reconstruct the lost Celtic form of the name as *Londonjon or something similar. This was then adapted into Latin \nLondon is a city in southwestern Ontario, Canada, along the Quebec City\u2013Windsor Corridor. The city had a population of 422,324 according to the 2021 Canadian census. London is at the confluence of the Thames River and North Thames River, approximately 200 km (120 mi) from both Toronto and Detroit; and about 230 km (140 mi) from Buffalo, New York. The city of London is politically separate from Middlesex County, though it remains the county seat.\nLondon and the Thames were named after the English city and river in 1793 by John Graves Simcoe, who proposed the site for the capital city of Upper Canada. The first European settlement was between 1801 and 1804 by Peter Hagerman. The village was founded in 1826 and incorporated in 1855. Since then, London has grown to be the largest southwestern Ontario municipality and Canada's 11th largest metropolitan area, having annexed many of the smaller communities that surround it.\nLondon is a regional centre of healthcare and education, being home to the University of Western Ontario (which brands itself \"Western University\"), Fanshawe College, and three major hospitals: Victoria Hospital, University Hospital and St. Joseph's Hospital. The city hosts a number of musical and artistic exhibits and festivals, which contribute to its tourism industry, but its economic activity is centered on education, medical research, manufacturing, financial services, and information technology. London's university and hospitals are among its top ten employers. London lies at the junction of Highways 401 and 402, connecting it to Toronto, Windsor, and Sarnia. These highways also make the Detroit-Windsor, Port Huron-Sarnia, and Niagara Falls border crossings with the United States easily accessible. The city also has railway stations and bus stations and is home to the London International Airport.\n\n\n== History ==\nA series of archaeological sites throughout southwestern Ontario, named for the Parkhill Complex excavated near Parkhill, indicate the presence of Paleo-Indians in the area dating back approximately 11,000 years. Just prior to European settlement, the London area was the site of several Attawandaron, Odawa, and Ojibwe villages. The Lawson Site in northwest London is an archaeological excavation and partial reconstruction of an approximately 500-year-old Neutral Iroquoian village, estimated to have been home to 2,000 people. These groups were driven out by the Iroquois by c.\u20091654 in the Beaver Wars. The Iroquois abandoned the region some 50 years later, driven out by the Ojibwa. An Anishinaabeg community site was described as located near the forks of Thames River (Anishinaabe language: Eshkani-ziibi, \"Antler River\") in c.\u20091690 and was referred to as Pahkatequayang (\"Baketigweyaang\":\"At the River Fork\" (lit: at where the by-stream is)).\nLater, in the early 19th century, the Munsee-Delaware Nation (the Munsee are a subtribe of the Lenape or Delaware people), expelled from their homeland in Modern New Jersey and Eastern Pennsylvania after the creation of the United States.\nThe Oneida Nation of the Thames, Chippewas of the Thames First Nation, and Munsee-Delaware Nation reserves are located south-west of the city.\n\n\n=== Settlement ===\nThe current location of London was selected as the site of the future capital of Upper Canada in 1793 by Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe, who also named the village which was founded in 1826. Originally, Simcoe had proposed to call it Georgiana, in honour of George III, the reigning monarch at that time. It did not become the capital Simcoe envisioned. Rather, it was an administrative seat for the area west of the actual capital, York (now Toronto). The London Township Treaty of 1796 with the Chippewa ceded the original town site on the north bank of the Thames (then known as the Escunnisepe) to Upper Canada.\nLondon was part of the Talbot Settlement, named for Colonel Thomas Talbot, the chief administrator of the area, who oversaw the land surveying and built the fi\nGreater London is an administrative area in England, coterminous with the London region, containing most of the continuous urban area of London. It contains 33 local government districts: the 32 London boroughs, which form a ceremonial county also called Greater London, and the City of London. The Greater London Authority is responsible for strategic local government across the region, and regular local government is the responsibility of the borough councils and the City of London Corporation. Greater London is bordered by the ceremonial counties of Hertfordshire to the north, Essex to the north-east, Kent to the south-east, Surrey to the south, and Berkshire and Buckinghamshire to the west.\nGreater London has a land area of 1,572 km2 (607 sq mi) and an estimated population of 8,866,180 in 2022. The ceremonial county of Greater London is only slightly smaller, with an area of 1,569 km2 (606 sq mi) and a population of 8,855,333 in 2022. The area is almost entirely urbanised and contains the majority of the Greater London Built-up Area, which extends into Hertfordshire, Essex, Kent, Surrey, and Berkshire and in 2011 had a population of 9,787,426. None of the administrative area, region, or ceremonial county hold city status, but the City of London and City of Westminster separately do. The area was historically part of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent and Hertfordshire.\nThe River Thames is the defining geographic feature of the area, entering it near Hampton in the west and flowing east before exiting downstream of Dagenham. Several tributaries of the Thames flow through the area, but are now mostly culverted and form part of London's sewerage system. The land immediately north and south of the river is flat, but rises to low hills further away, notably Hampstead Heath, Shooter's Hill, and Sydenham Hill. The area's highest point is Westerham Heights (245 m (804 ft)), part of the North Downs. In the north-east the area contains part of Epping Forest, an ancient woodland.\nThe City of London has had its own government since the Anglo-Saxon period. The first London-wide directly elected local government was the London County Council, established for the County of London in 1889, which covered the core of the urban area. In 1965 the county was abolished and replaced by Greater London, a two-tier administrative area governed by the Greater London Council, thirty-two London boroughs, and the City of London Corporation. The Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, and its responsibilities largely taken over by the boroughs. The Greater London Authority was formed in 2000.\n\n\n== Administrative history ==\n\nThe term \"Greater London\" was used before it was established by statute in 1965. It referred to the Metropolitan Police District, the area served by the Metropolitan Water Board, the London Passenger Transport Area, and the area defined by the Registrar General as the \"Greater London Conurbation\". The term was also used for the Greater London Arterial Road Programme, devised between 1913 and 1916, and the Greater London Planning Region, devised in 1927, which occupied 1,856 square miles (4,810 km2) and included 9 million people.\n\n\n=== Proposals to expand the County of London ===\n\nAlthough the London County Council (LCC) and County of London were created in 1889, the area did not cover all of London. London's built-up area, postal district, transport network and Metropolitan Police District, extended vastly beyond the boundaries of the new administrative county. Many of the LCC housing projects, including the vast Becontree Estates, were also outside its boundaries. The LCC pressed for an alteration in its boundaries soon after the end of the First World War, noting that within the Metropolitan and City Police Districts there were 122 housing authorities. A Royal Commission on London Government was set up to consider the issue. The LCC proposed a vast new area for Greater London, with a boundary somewhere between the Metropolitan Poli\nThe City of London, also known as the City, is a city, ceremonial county and local government district that contains the ancient centre, and constitutes, along with Canary Wharf, the primary central business district (CBD) of London and one of the leading financial centres of the world. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the modern area referred to as London has since grown far beyond the City of London boundary. The City is now only a small part of the metropolis of Greater London, though it remains a notable part of central London. The City of London is not one of the London boroughs, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including Greater London's only other city, the City of Westminster). It is also a separate ceremonial county, being an enclave surrounded by the ceremonial county of Greater London, and is the smallest ceremonial county in England.\nThe City of London is known colloquially as the Square Mile, as it is 1.12 sq mi (716.80 acres; 2.90 km2) in area. Both the terms the City and the Square Mile are often used as metonyms for the UK's trading and financial services industries, which continue a notable history of being largely based in the City. The name London is now ordinarily used for a far wider area than just the City. London most often denotes the sprawling London metropolis, or the 32 Greater London boroughs, in addition to the City of London itself. \nThe local authority for the City, namely the City of London Corporation, is unique in the UK and has some unusual responsibilities for a local council, such as being the police authority. It is also unusual in having responsibilities and ownerships beyond its boundaries, e.g. Hampstead Heath. The corporation is headed by the Lord Mayor of the City of London (an office separate from, and much older than, the Mayor of London). The Lord Mayor, as of November 2023, is Michael Mainelli. The City is made up of 25 wards, with administration at the historic Guildhall. Other historic sites include St Paul's Cathedral, Royal Exchange, Mansion House, Old Bailey, and Smithfield Market. Although not within the City, the adjacent Tower of London, built to dominate the City, is part of its old defensive perimeter. The City has responsibility for five bridges across the Thames in its capacity as trustee of the Bridge House Estates: Blackfriars Bridge, Millennium Bridge, Southwark Bridge, London Bridge and Tower Bridge.\nThe City is a major business and financial centre, with both the Bank of England and the London Stock Exchange based in the City. Throughout the 19th century, the City was the world's primary business centre, and it continues to be a major meeting point for businesses. London was ranked second (after New York) in the Global Financial Centres Index, published in 2022. The insurance industry is concentrated in the eastern side of the city, around Lloyd's building. Since about the 1980s, a secondary financial district has existed outside the city, at Canary Wharf, 2.5 miles (4 km) to the east. The legal profession has a major presence in the northern and western sides of the City, especially in the Temple and Chancery Lane areas where the Inns of Court are located, two of which (Inner Temple and Middle Temple) fall within the City of London boundary.\nPrimarily a business district, the City has a small resident population of 8,583 based on 2021 census figures, but over 500,000 are employed there (as of 2019) and some estimates put the number of workers in the City to be over 1 million. About three-quarters of the jobs in the City of London are in the financial, professional, and associated business services sectors.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n \n\nThe Roman legions established a settlement known as \"Londinium\" on the current site of the City of London around AD 43. Its bridge over the River Thames turned the city into a road nexus and major port, serving as a major commercial cen\n.london is a top-level domain (TLD) for London, England. It was approved by ICANN as a city-level TLD on 7 June 2013. On 29 April 2014, the domain name went on sale for the first time. London and Partners, which promotes the city, said that .london would carry a premium because of its exclusivity.\n\n\n== References ==\nThe London Underground (also known simply as the Underground or by its nickname the Tube) is a rapid transit system serving Greater London and some parts of the adjacent home counties of Buckinghamshire, Essex and Hertfordshire in England.\n\nThe Underground has its origins in the Metropolitan Railway, opening on 10 January 1863 as the world's first underground passenger railway. The Metropolitan is now part of the Circle, District, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines. The first line to operate underground electric traction trains, the City & South London Railway in 1890, is now part of the Northern line.\nThe network has expanded to 11 lines with 250 miles (400 km) of track.  However, the Underground does not cover most southern parts of Greater London; there are only 33 Underground stations south of the River Thames. The system's 272 stations collectively accommodate up to 5 million passenger journeys a day.  In 2023/24 it was used for 1.181 billion passenger journeys.\nThe system's first tunnels were built just below the ground, using the cut-and-cover method; later, smaller, roughly circular tunnels\u2014which gave rise to its nickname, the Tube\u2014were dug through at a deeper level. Despite its name, only 45% of the system is under the ground: much of the network in the outer environs of London is on the surface.\nThe early tube lines, originally owned by several private companies, were brought together under the Underground brand in the early 20th century, and eventually merged along with the sub-surface lines and bus services in 1933 to form London Transport under the control of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB). The current operator, London Underground Limited (LUL), is a wholly owned subsidiary of Transport for London (TfL), the statutory corporation responsible for the transport network in London. As of 2015, 92% of operational expenditure is covered by passenger fares. The Travelcard ticket was introduced in 1983 and Oyster card, a contactless ticketing system, in 2003. Contactless bank card payments were introduced in 2014, the first such use on a public transport system.\nThe LPTB commissioned many new station buildings, posters and public artworks in a modernist style. The schematic Tube map, designed by Harry Beck in 1931, was voted a national design icon in 2006 and now includes other transport systems besides the Underground, such as the Docklands Light Railway, London Overground, Thameslink, the Elizabeth line, and Tramlink. Other famous London Underground branding includes the roundel and the Johnston typeface, created by Edward Johnston in 1916.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\n\n==== Sub-surface lines ====\nThe idea of an underground railway linking the City of London with the urban centre was proposed in the 1830s, and the Metropolitan Railway was granted permission to build such a line in 1854. To prepare construction, a short test tunnel was built in 1855 in Kibblesworth, a small town with geological properties similar to London. This test tunnel was used for two years in the development of the first underground train, and was later, in 1861, filled up. The world's first underground railway, it opened in January 1863 between Paddington and Farringdon using gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives. It was hailed as a success, carrying 38,000 passengers on the opening day, and borrowing trains from other railways to supplement the service. The Metropolitan District Railway (commonly known as the District Railway) opened in December 1868 from South Kensington to Westminster as part of a plan for an underground \"inner circle\" connecting London's main-line stations.  The Metropolitan and District railways completed the Circle line in 1884, built using the cut and cover method. Both railways expanded, the District building five branches to the west reaching Ealing, Hounslow, Uxbridge, Richmond and Wimbledon and the Metropolitan eventually extended as far as Verney Junction in Buckinghamshire\nLondon derbies are the various local football derbies between the teams in London, England. It specifically refers to individual matches between the teams, but can also be used to describe the general ongoing rivalry between the clubs and fans. The first London Football League derby took place at Clapton Stadium on 11 November 1905, where Chelsea beat Clapton Orient 3\u20130 in a Second Division match. Chelsea also won the first top-flight London derby with a 2\u20131 victory over Woolwich Arsenal (now Arsenal), in a First Division game at Stamford Bridge on 9 November 1907. The first FA Cup Final to be contested between two teams from London was the 1967 Final, where Tottenham Hotspur beat Chelsea 2\u20131. As of the 2021\u201322 season, there are thirteen clubs in the Premier League and Football League that play in the Greater London area. Arsenal against Tottenham Hotspur and Millwall against West Ham United are ranked as two of the most ferocious London derbies.\n\n\n== Clubs in London ==\nAs of 2023\u201324 season\n\nDefunct English Football League clubs based in London include Thames and Wimbledon.\n\n\n== Major London derbies ==\nNorth London derby \u2013 between Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur. A rivalry has existed since Arsenal's move to the Highbury area of North London in 1913, and especially since Arsenal's promotion to the First Division in 1919. It is perhaps the most hotly contested of all London derbies, with the two clubs located just 4 miles (6.4 km) away from each other in neighbouring boroughs. They have played each other about 200 times.\nNorth vs West London derby\nArsenal F.C.\u2013Chelsea F.C. rivalry \u2013 is the oldest top level rivalry between North London Arsenal and West London Chelsea and the most contested London derby. They first met in the First Division in 1907 and have competed more than 200 games together.  They have met in all three major domestic competitions and both the Champions League and Europa League.\nChelsea F.C.\u2013Tottenham Hotspur F.C. rivalry \u2013 is a rivalry dating back to their first meeting in 1909, between West London Chelsea and North London Tottenham Hotspur. They've played each other just over 160 times.\nMillwall F.C.\u2013West Ham United F.C. rivalry \u2013 is a South London vs East London derby between Millwall and West Ham United, also known as the Dockers derby due to the clubs' historical ties to the shipbuilding industry along the Thames. The fixture grew out of a rivalry between competing London dockers and remains fierce (matches have often been marred by violence and hooliganism) despite only being contested infrequently, due to the clubs most years being in separate divisions for much of their histories. The rivals have played each other 99 times, mostly before World War II. It is perhaps the bitterest of the London rivalries and there have been a number of films portraying it, most notably Green Street.\nEast London derby \u2013 any between Leyton Orient, West Ham United and Dagenham & Redbridge, a fixture which, for the same reasons as the Dockers derby, rarely takes place. West Ham and Leyton Orient last met competitively in January 1987, and West Ham and Dagenham & Redbridge have never met since the latter was formed in 1992 from the merger of Redbridge Forest and Dagenham. However, Leyton Orient and Dagenham & Redbridge meet occasionally in the lower leagues.\nSouth London derby \u2013 any between AFC Wimbledon, Charlton Athletic, Crystal Palace, Millwall and Sutton United. Although Millwall's fiercest rivalry is with East Londoners West Ham United, they also have a rivalry with their neighbours Crystal Palace, and Charlton Athletic. The five teams have contested over 300 games between them.\nWest London derby \u2013 any between Brentford, Chelsea, Fulham and Queens Park Rangers. The clubs of Brentford, Fulham and Queens Park Rangers share longstanding rivalries with each other.

The university was established by royal charter in 1836 as a degree-awarding examination board for students holding certificates from University College London, King's College London and \"other such institutions, corporate or unincorporated, as shall be established for the purpose of Education, whether within the Metropolis or elsewhere within our United Kingdom\". It is one of three institutions to have advertised themselves as the third-oldest university in England. It moved to a federal structure with constituent colleges in 1900. It is now incorporated by its fourth (1863) royal charter and governed by the University of London Act 2018 (c. iii).\nThe university consists of 17 member institutions and three central academic bodies. The university has around 48,000 distance learning external students and around 219,410  campus-based internal students, making it the largest university by number of students in the United Kingdom. For most practical purposes, ranging from admissions to funding, the member institutions operate on an independent basis, with many awarding their own degrees whilst remaining in the federal university.\nUnder the 2018 act, member institutions ceased to be termed colleges and gained the right to seek university status without having to leave the federal university: Birkbeck, City, Goldsmiths, King's College London, London School of Economics and Political Science, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Queen Mary, Royal Holloway, Royal Veterinary College, School of Oriental and African Studies, St George's, and University College London have all indicated that they intend to do so.\nAs of 2015, there are around 2 million University of London alumni across the world, including at least 14 monarchs or royalty, more than 60 presidents or prime ministers in the world (including five prime ministers of the United Kingdom), two Cabinet Secretaries of the UK, 98 Nobel laureates, five Fields Medallists, four Turing Award winners, six Grammy winners, two Oscar winners, three Olympic gold medalists and the \"Father of the Nation\" of several countries. The university owns the University of London Press.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nAll universities are different, but some are more different than others. The University of London is the most different of them all.\nUniversity College London (UCL) was founded under the name \"London University\" (but without recognition by the state) in 1826 as a secular alternative to the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, which limited their degrees to members of the established Church of England. As a result of the controversy surrounding UCL's establishment, King's College London was founded as an Anglican college by royal charter in 1829.\nIn 1830, UCL applied for a royal charter as a university which would allow it to confer degrees. This was rejected, but renewed in 1834. In response to this, opposition to \"exclusive\" rights grew among the London medical schools. The idea of a general degree awarding body for the schools was discussed in the medical press and in evidence taken by the Select Committee on Medical Education. However, the blocking of a bill to open up Oxford and Cambridge degrees to dissenters led to renewed pressure on the Government to grant degree awarding powers to an institution that would not apply religious tests, particularly as the degrees of the new University of Durham were also to be closed to non-Anglicans.\nIn 1835, the government announced the response to UCL's petition for a charter. Two charters would be issued, one to UCL incorporating it as a college rather than a university, without degree awarding powers, and a second \"establishing a Metropolitan University, with power to grant academical degrees to those who should study at the London University College, or a\nThe name \"London Bridge\" refers to several historic crossings that have spanned the River Thames between the City of London and Southwark, in central London since Roman times. The current crossing, which opened to traffic in 1973, is a box girder bridge built from concrete and steel. It replaced a 19th-century stone-arched bridge, which in turn superseded a 600-year-old stone-built medieval structure. In addition to the roadway, for much of its history, the broad medieval bridge supported an extensive built up area of homes and businesses, part of the City's Bridge ward, and its southern end in Southwark was guarded by a large stone City gateway. The medieval bridge was preceded by a succession of timber bridges, the first of which was built by the Roman founders of London (Londinium) around AD 50.\nThe current bridge stands at the western end of the Pool of London and is positioned 30 metres (98 ft) upstream from previous alignments. The approaches to the medieval bridge were marked by the church of St Magnus-the-Martyr on the northern bank and by Southwark Cathedral on the southern shore. Until Putney Bridge opened in 1729, London Bridge was the only road crossing of the Thames downstream of Kingston upon Thames. London Bridge has been depicted in its several forms, in art, literature, and songs, including the nursery rhyme \"London Bridge Is Falling Down\", and the epic poem The Waste Land by T. S. Eliot.\nThe modern bridge is owned and maintained by Bridge House Estates, an independent charity of medieval origin overseen by the City of London Corporation. It carries the A3 road, which is maintained by the Greater London Authority. The crossing also delineates an area along the southern bank of the River Thames, between London Bridge and Tower Bridge, that has been designated as a business improvement district.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nThe abutments of modern London Bridge rest several metres above natural embankments of gravel, sand and clay. From the late Neolithic era the southern embankment formed a natural causeway above the surrounding swamp and marsh of the river's estuary; the northern ascended to higher ground at the present site of Cornhill. Between the embankments, the River Thames could have been crossed by ford when the tide was low, or ferry when it was high. Both embankments, particularly the northern, would have offered stable beachheads for boat traffic up and downstream \u2013 the Thames and its estuary were a major inland and Continental trade route from at least the 9th century BC.\nThere is archaeological evidence for scattered Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age settlement nearby, but until a bridge was built there, London did not exist. A few miles upstream, beyond the river's upper tidal reach, two ancient fords were in use. These were apparently aligned with the course of Watling Street, which led into the heartlands of the Catuvellauni, Britain's most powerful tribe at the time of Caesar's invasion of 54 BC. Some time before Claudius's conquest of AD 43, power shifted to the Trinovantes, who held the region northeast of the Thames Estuary from a capital at Camulodunum, nowadays Colchester in Essex. Claudius imposed a major colonia at Camulodunum, and made it the capital city of the new Roman province of Britannia. The first London Bridge was built by the Romans as part of their road-building programme, to help consolidate their conquest.\n\n\n=== Roman bridges ===\nIt is possible that Roman military engineers built a pontoon type bridge at the site during the conquest period (AD 43). A bridge of any kind would have given a rapid overland shortcut to Camulodunum from the southern and Kentish ports, along the Roman roads of Stane Street and Watling Street (now the A2). The Roman roads leading to and from London were probably built around AD 50, and the river-crossing was possibly served by a permanent timber bridge. On the relatively high, dry ground at the northern end of the bridge, a small, opportunist\nNamastey London (transl.\u2009'Greetings London') is a 2007 Indian romance film, directed and produced by Vipul Amrutlal Shah. It stars Rishi Kapoor, Akshay Kumar, Katrina Kaif, Nina Wadia, Javed Sheikh, Upen Patel and Clive Standen. The film is originally based on the real life story of Kumar's friend. Riteish Deshmukh appears in a cameo role in the film.\n\"Namastey London\" was released on March 23, 2007, and it received positive reviews for its direction, screenplay, and soundtrack, particularly Akshay Kumar's performance, which was highly acclaimed, and its music album, composed by Himesh Reshammiya. It was highly acclaimed and performed well on its music charts, with its songs becoming chartbuster hits. It was also a box office success, earning \u20b971.40 crore worldwide, thus becoming the ninth-highest grossing Hindi film of 2007. The success of the film ended a long dry spell of box office failures since the release of Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute to Love which was released in January 2007.\nAt the 53rd Filmfare Awards, Namastey London received 1 nomination \u2013 Best Actor (Kumar).\nSeveral critics noted similarities between the film and Manoj Kumar's Purab Aur Paschim (1970), though the director denied it being a remake.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIndian-born Manmohan Malhotra relocated to London to establish himself and return to India, and he married Bebo; after four years, he obtained a visa for her so that she could live with him. Shortly thereafter, she gave birth to Jasmeet. Manmohan was always embarrassed by Bebo, as she could not speak English and hence couldn't mingle with British people. As a result, he always left her out on important occasions while he socialised. Bebo did not want Jasmeet to end up like her, so she got her educated in an English school and encouraged her to mingle with British friends. Jasmeet was transformed into Jazz, a young, beautiful girl modern in looks, talk, habits, and heart. But she is ashamed of her Indian heritage and looks down on it.\nHer father had set her to meet a young person, Bobby Bedi, although the date turns out to be a disaster, and Bobby leaves and rejects her. Manmohan thinks that it is impossible to get him an Indian son-in-law, and his best friend, Parvez Khan, is in a similar situation with his son Imran, who has a girlfriend, Susan. Manmohan takes his family on a tour of India and forces Jasmeet to marry Arjun Singh, who does not know how to speak English.\nOn their return to London, Jasmeet announces that she will marry an Englishman named Charlie Brown, who is well educated and has good friends and connections, even with Prince Charles. She refuses to recognise her marriage to Arjun as there is no legal proof of the wedding. When Jasmeet is introduced to the friends of the Brown family, she is subjected to racial comments from them and feels offended. Arjun notices Jazz is unhappy and goes with her to tell Charlie's family about India, and Jazz translates this for Charlie's family, as they don't understand Hindi. Jazz gets engaged to Charlie Brown, leaving Arjun depressed as he leaves, while Manmohan finds him in the bar. Arjun tells Manmohan that Jazz is going to marry Charlie, and he is in fact heartbroken that she left him for Charlie and realizes that he isn't the right man for her. Arjun also accepts Charlie's challenge of a rugby match despite not knowing how to play. Charlie and his rugby team mates make fun of the Indians and Pakistanis not knowing the game. As Manmohan is tired of playing rugby, he calls Arjun over to defeat the England team, and he wins the rugby match, impressing Jazz. Soon Arjun tells Jazz that when they get old they will meet at the same place they met when they were young. During this period, Jazz becomes close with Arjun and Charlie starts to get irritated with Arjun but Arjun still supports Jazz. Imran is then asked by Susan's parents to leave Islam and to become a Christian and to change his name to Emmanuel or Ian, as well as provide written proof that his fam\n1920 London is a 2016 Indian supernatural horror film directed by Tinu Suresh Desai. It is the third installment in the 1920 film series, after 1920 and 1920: The Evil Returns. The film stars Sharman Joshi, Meera Chopra, and Vishal Karwal in lead roles. The film managed to recover its budget and became a moderate success but it couldn't repeat the success of its previous installments. It was followed by another installment titled 1921.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film opens with Shivangi, the princess of a royal house in Sikar, Rajasthan, now living in London with her husband Kunwar Veer Singh. They are a happy couple until one day when Veer develops a minor illness that soon develops into a disease, shrivelling his body and shrinking his head. Veer is hospitalised, and his symptoms worsen \u2013 his body begins to contort unnaturally, and he begins growling in strange languages. The doctors seem to diagnose it as tetanus, which is incurable. Shivangi is frightened; Veer is just not the same, and Shivangi's handmaiden, Kesar Ma, deems it black magic.\nKesar Ma thinks it is because Veer's father, the King, had two wives, and the second wife wanted Veer, the heir, out of the way. The film moves to Rajasthan, where Shivangi and her family visit an exorcist to remedy Veer's condition. The exorcist attempts to confront the spirit by entering the other realm through a mirror but is soon expelled, being too weak to confront the entity. The exorcist refers the King to the most powerful spiritual master in the land, Mewar Baba, whose real name is Jai Singh Gujjar.\nShivangi shudders on hearing about Jai. Some years ago, she was deeply in love with Jai. Her uncle saw them together and attempted to blackmail her into sleeping with him. Jai stepped in and fought off the uncle, who promptly reported the scuffle to the king. Jai was charged with attempted murder. Shivangi inexplicably stood as a witness against Jai, who was then sentenced to prison for five years. Shivangi contacts Jai to help her save her husband. Jai flatly refuses, but Shivangi pleads with him for help, and he finally agrees to go to London.\nJai investigates the matter and discovers that Veer's troubles began upon receiving a strange amulet as a gift from an unknown admirer in Rajasthan. The amulet transmitted the demon into Veer. Jai prepares Shivangi into reciting a spiritual chant to bind the spirit to their mansion so that Jai can throw the locket into the Thames River, thereby freeing Veer. Shivangi maintains the chant over the demon's attempt to thwart it, and Jai finishes the task. However, it is revealed that the amulet and the entity were dispatched by Jai himself, and as he prepares to leave London, Shivangi confronts him, asking him how he knows the source of the amulet. Jai admits his vengeance, saying that he wanted Veer dead. Shivangi reveals why she betrayed him years ago: When their affair was revealed, the King had ordered Jai to be killed. Shivangi had begged for his life, and it was granted for the price of her betrayal. Now guilty and dismayed, Jai resolves to stay in London and free Veer from the demon.\nJai prepares his final assault on the spirit and invokes his own spiritual master through a letter. The master chastises Jai for acting in haste and then regretfully says that the demon will not leave without taking a soul. The master directs Jai to an abandoned church where he receives a set of charmed Celtic daggers. Jai prepares a charm to attack the entity. He enters the spirit's realm through a mirror and recovers the amulet. It attacks ferociously and is about to stop Shivangi when Jai smashes the mirror, closing the portal and trapping himself in the realm, so Shivangi can burn the amulet and free her husband. Shivangi sees Jai smile peacefully from a shard of the mirror before it breaks as Veer comes to life. After two weeks, Veer and Shivangi find the letter of correspondence between Jai and his master. Jai had offered his soul so Veer could be freed. Veer is \nHeathrow Airport (), called London Airport until 1966 (IATA: LHR, ICAO: EGLL), and now known as London Heathrow, is the main international airport serving London, the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom. It is the largest of the six international airports in the London airport system (the others being Gatwick, Stansted, Luton, City and Southend). The airport is owned and operated by Heathrow Airport Holdings. In 2023, Heathrow was the busiest airport in Europe, the fourth-busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic and the second-busiest airport in the world by international passenger traffic. As of 2023, Heathrow is the airport with the most international connections in the world.\nHeathrow was founded as a small airfield in 1930 but was developed into a much larger airport after World War II. It lies 14 miles (23 kilometres) west of Central London on a site that covers 4.74 square miles (12.3 square kilometres). It was gradually expanded over 75 years and now has two parallel east\u2013west runways, four operational passengers terminals and one cargo terminal. The airport is the primary hub for British Airways and Virgin Atlantic.\n\n\n== Location ==\nHeathrow is 14 miles (23 km) west of Central London. It is located 3 miles (5 km) west of Hounslow, 3 miles (5 km) south of Hayes, and 3 miles (5 km) north-east of Staines-upon-Thames.\nHeathrow falls entirely within the boundaries of the London Borough of Hillingdon, and under the Twickenham postcode area, with the postcode TW6. It is surrounded by the villages of Sipson, Harlington, Harmondsworth, and Longford to the north and the neighbourhoods of Cranford and Hatton to the east. To the south lie Feltham, Bedfont and Stanwell while to the west Heathrow is separated from Slough, Horton and Windsor in Berkshire by the M25 motorway. The airport is located within the Hayes and Harlington parliamentary constituency.\nAs the airport is located west of London and as its runways run east\u2013west, an aircraft's landing approach is usually directly over the Greater London Urban Area when the wind has a westerly component \u2014 as it often has.\nThe airport forms part of a travel to work area consisting of (most of) Greater London, and neighbouring parts of the surrounding Home Counties.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHeathrow Airport began in 1929 as a small airfield (Great West Aerodrome) on land southeast of the hamlet of Heathrow from which the airport takes its name. At that time the land consisted of farms, market gardens and orchards; there was a \"Heathrow Farm\" approximately where the modern Terminal 2 is situated, a \"Heathrow Hall\" and a \"Heathrow House.\" This hamlet was largely along a country lane (Heathrow Road), which ran roughly along the east and south edges of the present central terminals area.\nDevelopment of the whole Heathrow area as a much larger airport began in 1944 during World War II. It was intended for long-distance military aircraft bound for the Far East. By the time some of the airfield's runways were usable, World War II had ended, and the UK Government continued to develop the site as a civil airport. The airport was opened on 25 March 1946 as London Airport. The airport was renamed Heathrow Airport in the last week of September 1966, to avoid confusion with the other two airports which serve London, Gatwick and Stansted. The design for the airport was by Sir Frederick Gibberd. He set out the original terminals and central-area buildings, including the original control tower and the multi-faith Chapel of St George's.\n\n\n== Operations ==\n\n\n=== Facilities ===\nHeathrow Airport is used by over 89 airlines flying to 214 destinations in 84 countries. The airport is the primary hub of British Airways and is a base for Virgin Atlantic. It has four passenger terminals (numbered 2 to 5) and a cargo terminal. In 2021 Heathrow served 19.4 million passengers, of which 17 million were international and 2.4 million domestic. The busiest year ever recorded was 2019 when \nLondon Grammar are an English indie pop band formed in Nottingham in 2009. The band consists of Hannah Reid, Dan Rothman, and Dominic \"Dot\" Major. Their debut extended play, Metal & Dust, was released in 2013 by Metal & Dust Recordings;  their debut album, If You Wait (2013), reached No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart and was certified Double Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The band's next two studio albums, Truth Is a Beautiful Thing (2017) and  \nCalifornian Soil (2021), both reached number 1 on the UK Albums Chart. \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2009\u20132012: Early career ===\nVocalist Hannah Reid and guitarist Dan Rothman are originally from London and met in the Ancaster Hall student residence at the University of Nottingham during their first year in 2009. Rothman saw that Reid played the guitar and contacted her to see if she wanted to collaborate. They were joined by Northampton native Dominic \"Dot\" Major (keyboard, djembe, drums) a year later, after he began playing music together with Rothman.  They chose the name as \"not only was it where we're from, but London is also so international and multicultural that it actually felt like quite a universal name in a way.\"\nAfter completing their studies in 2010, the trio moved to London to pursue a career in music. By the end of the year, they were managed by Conor Wheeler, who began promoting them. The band began playing low-key gigs at local bars, honing their material. They soon found themselves noticed by a number of A&R people, and they were signed with the Ministry of Sound while Big Life took over the management duties in the second half of 2013. In the same year, the trio did some early recordings with Rollo Armstrong of Faithless and Liam Howe of Sneaker Pimps. Later in the year, the band continued to work with Tim Bran of Dreadzone and Roy Kerr, and by the end of the year, most of the recording had been completed. On 12 November 2012, the trio posted their song \"Hey Now\" remixed for Sasha by The Cut on YouTube; it immediately received a huge amount of attention.\n\n\n=== 2013\u20132016: If You Wait ===\nTheir EP Metal & Dust followed in February 2013, and it made the top five of the iTunes chart in Australia. It created a lot of interest, and the band received significant airplay on national radio. They released their single \"Wasting My Young Years\" in June 2013, peaking at No. 31 on the UK Singles Chart. The band was also featured on Disclosure's album Settle with the track \"Help Me Lose My Mind\", released in June 2013. The band has recorded two live sessions for Radio 1, and they played at 10 summer 2013 European music festivals. In September 2013, Reid was the subject of a Radio 1 Breakfast Show Twitter post, which was criticised for being sexist. The backlash forced the corporation to apologise, while the trio \"decided to stay out of it\".\nOn 1 September 2013, they released \"Strong\", which peaked at No. 16 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was later used in the 2014 American TV series Reckless for its second episode, \"Parting Shots\". On 9 September 2013, they released their debut studio album, If You Wait, which peaked at No. 2 on both the UK Albums Chart and Australian Albums Chart, as well as at No. 11 on the French Albums Chart, No. 13 on the Irish Albums Chart and No. 22 on the New Zealand Albums Chart. The band is signed to Columbia Records in the United States. On 8 December 2013, a single for the album, \"Nightcall\" was released. Their cover was used again in Reckless in its last episode, \"Civil Wars Part 2\".\nOn 13 January 2014, the band performed \"Strong\" and \"Wasting My Young Years\" on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, marking their debut performance on American television. On 26 January 2014 the bands rising success in Australia was recognised in Triple J's Hottest 100 countdown for 2013, with \"Strong\", \"Hey Now\" and \"Wasting My Young Years\" placing 10th, 35th and 61st respectively.

TfL-sponsored operators run more than 500 services.\nExamples of non TfL-sponsored operators include, but are not limited to: Arriva Herts & Essex, Arriva Southern Counties, Carousel Buses, Diamond South East, Go-Coach, First Beeline, Metrobus, Stagecoach South, Thames Valley Buses and Reading Buses.\n\n\n== Classification of route numbers ==\nIn Victorian times, people who took the bus would recognise the owner and the route of an omnibus (Latin: \"for everyone\") only by its livery and its line name, with painted signs on the sides showing the two termini to indicate the route. Then, in 1906, George Samuel Dicks of the London Motor Omnibus Company decided that, as the line name 'Vanguard' had proved to be very popular, he would name all lines 'Vanguard' and number the company's five routes 1 through 5. Other operators soon saw the advantage, in that a unique route number was easier for the travelling public to remember, and so the practice of using route numbers soon spread.\n\n\n=== Historic classification ===\n\nBus routes run by London Transport were grouped as follows.\nThe London Traffic Act 1924 imposed numbering known as the Bassom Scheme, named after Superintendent (later Chief Constable) Arthur Ernest Bassom of the Metropolitan Police who devised it. For many decades, variant and short workings used letter suffixes (e.g. \"77B\"). The numbers reflected the company that operated the route.\nThe numbering was revised in 1934 after London Transport was formed:\n\n\n=== Current classification ===\n\n\n== List of routes ==\nAll routes operate in both directions unless detailed.\n\n\n=== 1\u201399 ===\n\n\n=== 100\u2013199 ===\n\n\n=== 200\u2013299 ===\n\n\n=== 300\u2013399 ===\n\n\n=== 400\u2013499 ===\n\n\n=== 500\u2013599 ===\n\n\n=== 600\u2013699 ===\n\nRoute numbers from 600 to 699 are used for school services, with the majority of them running one return journey on each weekday during peak times and during school term time.\n\n\n=== 900\u2013999 ===\n\nRoute numbers from 900 to 999 represent mobility buses; these mostly provide a once-a-week return journey to a local shopping centre from relatively low-density neighbourhoods where there is no alternative route in the main bus network. The number of mobility buses routes has declined over the past few years because low-floor and wheelchair-accessible buses run on all London Buses routes.\n\n\n=== Letter prefixes ===\n\n\n=== East London Transit routes (EL-prefixed) ===\n\n\n=== Superloop routes (SL-prefixed) ===\n\n\n=== Night only routes (N-prefixed) ===\n\nNight Bus routes are often related to the day numerical equivalent, normally running the same route but with an extension at either end of the service. This is normally to provide a night service to destinations served by tube or train during the day.\nHowever, there are a few N-prefixed route numbers that have no relation to their daytime equivalents: the N5, N20, and N97 all operate in a different part of London to their respective day routes. Also, the N550 and N551 (which provide night service on parts of the DLR network), and the N271 (whose daytime service was withdrawn on 4 February 2023) have no corresponding daytime routes.\nThere are also 24-hour routes, which run day and night but usually with a lower frequency during the night hours. The vast majority run the same route at all times. With the introduction of the Night Tube, some day routes have been extended to run during Friday and Saturday nights to serve the stations.\n\n\n== Non-TfL bus routes in Greater London ==\nThese bus routes are not contracted to TfL and are therefore no\nUniversity College London (branded as UCL) is a public research university in London, England. It is a member institution of the federal University of London, and is the second-largest university in the United Kingdom by total enrolment and the largest by postgraduate enrolment.\nEstablished in 1826 as London University (though without university degree-awarding powers) by founders inspired by the radical ideas of Jeremy Bentham, UCL was the first university institution to be established in London, and the first in England to be entirely secular and to admit students regardless of their religion. It was also among the first university colleges to admit women alongside men in 1878, two years after University College, Bristol. Intended by its founders to be England's third university, politics forced it to accept the status of a college in 1836, when it received a royal charter and became one of the two founding colleges of the University of London, although it achieved de facto recognition as a university in the 1990s and formal university status in 2023. It has grown through mergers, including with the Institute of Ophthalmology (in 1995), the Institute of Neurology (in 1997), the Royal Free Hospital Medical School (in 1998), the Eastman Dental Institute (in 1999), the School of Slavonic and East European Studies (in 1999), the School of Pharmacy (in 2012) and the Institute of Education (in 2014).\nUCL has its main campus in the Bloomsbury area of central London, with a number of institutes and teaching hospitals elsewhere in central London and has a second campus, UCL East, at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford, East London. UCL is organised into 11 constituent faculties, within which there are over 100 departments, institutes and research centres. UCL operates several museums and collections in a wide range of fields, including the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology and the Grant Museum of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy, and administers the annual Orwell Prize in political writing. In 2022/23, UCL had a total income of \u00a31.93 billion, of which \u00a3527 million was from research grants and contracts. The university generates around \u00a310 billion annually for the UK economy, primarily through the spread of its research and knowledge (\u00a34 billion) and the impact of its own spending (\u00a33 billion).\nUCL is a member of numerous academic organisations, including the Russell Group and the League of European Research Universities, and is part of UCL Partners, the world's largest academic health science centre. It is considered part of the \"golden triangle\" of research-intensive universities in southeast England. UCL has publishing and commercial activities including UCL Press, UCL Business and UCL Consultants.\nUCL has many notable alumni, including the founder of Mauritius, the first Prime Minister of Japan, one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, and the members of Coldplay. UCL academics discovered five of the naturally occurring noble gases, discovered hormones, invented the vacuum tube, and made several foundational advances in modern statistics. As of 2024, 32 Nobel Prize winners and three Fields medallists have been affiliated with UCL as alumni or academic staff.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1826 to 1836 \u2013 London University ===\n\nUCL was founded on 11 February 1826 as an alternative to the Anglican universities of Oxford and Cambridge. It took the form of a joint stock company, with shares sold for \u00a3100 (equivalent to \u00a310,600 in 2023) to proprietors, under the name of London University, although without legal recognition as a university or the associated right to award degrees. London University's first warden was Leonard Horner, who was the first scientist to head a British university.\n\nDespite the commonly held belief that the philosopher Jeremy Bentham was the founder of UCL, his direct involvement was limited to the purchase of share No. 633, at a cost of \u00a3100 paid in nine instalments between December 1826 and January 18\nLondon Nicole Breed (born August 11, 1974) is an American politician who is the 45th and current mayor of San Francisco, serving since 2018. She was supervisor for District 5 and was president of the Board of Supervisors from 2015 to 2018.\nRaised in the Western Addition neighborhood of San Francisco, Breed worked in government after college. She was elected to the Board of Supervisors in 2012 (taking office in January 2013), and elected its president in 2015. As president of the Board, Breed, according to the city charter, became the acting mayor of San Francisco following the death of Mayor Ed Lee. She served in this role from December 12, 2017, to January 23, 2018.\nBreed won the San Francisco mayoral special election held on June 5, 2018. Breed is the first black woman, second black person after Willie Brown, and second woman after Dianne Feinstein to be elected mayor of San Francisco. She was sworn in as mayor on July 11, 2018. During her tenure as mayor, she has been a proponent of increasing housing supply in San Francisco amid a housing shortage, frequently butting heads with anti-housing members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn in San Francisco, Breed was raised by her grandmother in Plaza East public housing in the Western Addition neighborhood of the city. As a youth, Breed lived with three siblings (two brothers and a sister), along with an aunt who was facing mental health challenges. Breed later wrote of her childhood in San Francisco, \"five of us living on $900 per month. 'Recycling' meant drinking out of old mayonnaise jars. Violence was never far away. And once a week, we took Grandma's pushcart to the community room to collect government-issued groceries.\" Her younger sister died of a drug overdose in 2006. Her brother, Napoleon Brown, is in prison serving a 44-year sentence for a 2000 conviction on charges of manslaughter and armed robbery, for which Breed has repeatedly asked for clemency from the governor's office. Breed has stated that her brother's early release from prison would be \"what's best for both Napoleon and society overall\".\nAt age 14, Breed worked as a paid intern at The Family School as part of the Mayor's Youth Employment and Training Program. She graduated with honors from Galileo High School where she played in the band and participated in school government. Although she entered college as a chemistry major, she earned a bachelor's degree in political science\u2013public service from the University of California, Davis in 1997 and a master's degree in public administration from the University of San Francisco in 2012. While in college, Breed babysat and cleaned houses to help pay for expenses. After college graduation, she said that \"I just didn't want to be poor,\" especially witnessing her grandmother's financial struggles.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nBreed worked as an intern in the Office of Housing and Neighborhood Services for Mayor Willie Brown. In 2002, she became the executive director of the African American Art & Culture Complex, where she raised over $2.5 million to renovate the complex's 34,000 square foot space, including an art gallery, theater space, and a recording studio. Breed was named to the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency Commission in 2004. In 2010, Mayor Gavin Newsom appointed her to the San Francisco Fire Commission.\n\n\n== San Francisco Board of Supervisors ==\n\nIn November 2012, Breed was elected to the District 5 supervisor seat, defeating incumbent Christina Olague, who had been appointed to the seat that year by Mayor Ed Lee after Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi was elected sheriff. Following five rounds of ranked-choice voting allocations, Breed won by over 12 points, marking the first time in San Francisco history that a challenger unseated a district supervisor. (The feat has occurred four times since, with Aaron Peskin unseating Supervisor Julie Christensen in 2015 to reclaim his District 3 seat, Rafael Mandelman beating Supervis\nJohn Griffith Chaney (January 12, 1876 \u2013 November 22, 1916), better known as Jack London, was an American novelist, journalist and activist. A pioneer of commercial fiction and American magazines, he was one of the first American authors to become an international celebrity and earn a large fortune from writing. He was also an innovator in the genre that would later become known as science fiction.\nLondon was part of the radical literary group \"The Crowd\" in San Francisco and a passionate advocate of animal welfare, workers' rights and socialism. London wrote several works dealing with these topics, such as his dystopian novel The Iron Heel, his non-fiction expos\u00e9 The People of the Abyss, War of the Classes, and Before Adam.\nHis most famous works include The Call of the Wild and White Fang, both set in Alaska and the Yukon during the Klondike Gold Rush, as well as the short stories \"To Build a Fire\", \"An Odyssey of the North\", and \"Love of Life\". He also wrote about the South Pacific in stories such as \"The Pearls of Parlay\" and \"The Heathen\".\n\n\n== Family ==\n\nJack London was born January 12, 1876. His mother, Flora Wellman, was the fifth and youngest child of Pennsylvania Canal builder Marshall Wellman and his first wife, Eleanor Garrett Jones.  Marshall Wellman was descended from Thomas Wellman, an early Puritan settler in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Flora left Ohio and moved to the Pacific coast when her father remarried after her mother died. In San Francisco, Flora worked as a music teacher and spiritualist.\nBiographer Clarice Stasz and others believe London's father was astrologer William Chaney. Flora Wellman was living with Chaney in San Francisco when she became pregnant. Whether Wellman and Chaney were legally married is unknown. Stasz notes that in his memoirs, Chaney refers to London's mother Flora Wellman as having been \"his wife\"; he also cites an advertisement in which Flora called herself \"Florence Wellman Chaney\".\nAccording to Flora Wellman's account, as recorded in the San Francisco Chronicle of June 4, 1875, Chaney demanded that she have an abortion. When she refused, he disclaimed responsibility for the child. In desperation, she shot herself. She was not seriously wounded, but she was temporarily deranged. After giving birth, Flora sent the baby for wet-nursing to Virginia (Jennie) Prentiss, a neighbor and former slave. Prentiss was an important maternal figure throughout London's life, and he would later refer to her as his primary source of love and affection as a child.\nLate in 1876, Flora Wellman married John London, a partially disabled Civil War veteran, and brought her baby John, later known as Jack, to live with the newly married couple. The family moved around the San Francisco Bay Area before settling in Oakland, where London completed public grade school. The Prentiss family moved with the Londons, and remained a stable source of care for the young Jack.\nIn 1897, when he was 21 and a student at the University of California, Berkeley, London searched for and read the newspaper accounts of his mother's suicide attempt and the name of his biological father. He wrote to William Chaney, then living in Chicago. Chaney responded that he could not be London's father because he was impotent; he casually asserted that London's mother had relations with other men and averred that she had slandered him when she said he insisted on an abortion. London was devastated by his father's letter; in the months following, he quit school at Berkeley and went to the Klondike during the gold rush boom.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nLondon was born near Third and Brannan Streets in San Francisco. The house burned down in the fire after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake; the California Historical Society placed a plaque at the site in 1953. Although the family was working class, it was not as impoverished as London's later accounts claimed. London was largely self-educated.\nIn 1885, London found and read Ouida's long Victorian no\nChinatown is an ethnic enclave in the City of Westminster, London, bordering Soho to its north and west, Theatreland to the south and east. The enclave currently occupies the area in and around Gerrard Street. It contains a number of Chinese restaurants, bakeries, supermarkets, souvenir shops, and other Chinese-run businesses. The first Chinatown was located in Limehouse in the East End.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first area in London known as Chinatown was located in the Limehouse area of the East End of London. At the start of the 20th century, the Chinese population of London was concentrated in that area, setting up businesses which catered to the Chinese sailors who frequented in Docklands. The area was known through exaggerated reports and tales of slum housing and (the then-legal) opium dens, rather than the Chinese restaurants and supermarkets of the current Chinatown. However, much of the area was damaged by aerial bombing during the Blitz in the Second World War, although a number of elderly Chinese still choose to live in this area. After the Second World War, however, the growing popularity of Chinese cuisine and an influx of immigrants from Hong Kong led to an increasing number of Chinese restaurants being opened elsewhere.\nThe present Chinatown, which is off Shaftesbury Avenue did not start to be established until the 1970s. Previously, it was a regular Soho area, run-down, with Gerrard Street the main thoroughfare. It was dominated by the Post Office, facing Macclesfield Street, and other major establishments were The Tailor & Cutter House, at 43/44, now a Chinese supermarket and restaurant, the Boulogne Restaurant, near the Wardour Street end, and by Peter Mario's Restaurant at the other end. Other businesses included a master baker's, the Sari Centre, Lesgrain French Coffee House, Harrison Marks' Glamour Studio, an Indian restaurant and various brothels. Probably the first Chinese restaurants opened in Lisle Street, parallel to Gerrard Street, and more opened gradually; one of the first restaurants was Kowloon Restaurant. The Tailor & Cutter did not close down until around 1974. The area now has more than 80 restaurants.\nIn 2005, the property developer Rosewheel proposed a plan to redevelop the eastern part of Chinatown. The plan was opposed by many of the existing retailers in Chinatown, as they believe that the redevelopment would drive out the traditional Chinese retail stores from the area and change the ethnic characteristic of Chinatown. In October 2013 and July 2018, the London Chinatown Community Centre (LCCC) organised a one-day shutdown in protest of violent tactics by immigration officers from the Home Office.\nThe London Chinatown Community Centre (LCCC) has been housed in the Chinatown area since it was founded in 1980 by Dr Abraham Lue. The Centre claims to have received 40,000 people for help and assistance since its foundation. Located since 1998 on the second floor of 28-29 Gerrard Street, the Centre relocated to 2 Leicester Court in 2012, above the Hippodrome Casino.\nOn 25 July 2016, a new Chinatown gate on Wardour Street was opened by Prince Andrew, the Duke of York. It was made by Chinese artisans and assembled in London. The gate is in the style of the Qing dynasty.\nThere was a Chinese-style pavilion at Newport Place from the 1980s which was a popular meeting point, but it was demolished in 2016 after more than thirty years, despite protests. The development authorities had plans to renovate and enlarge the square. The construction of a new pavilion at a different location was announced.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nChinatown has no officially defined size, but it has commonly been considered to approximately encompass Gerrard Street, the bottom half of Wardour Street, Rupert Street and Rupert Court, a section of Shaftesbury Avenue and Lisle Street, Macclesfield Street and Newport Place, Newport Court and Little Newport Street.\n\nCharing Cross Road \u2013 built 1887, and named as it led to the cross at Charing, fr\nJason Paul London (born November 7, 1972) is an American actor, known for his roles as Randall \"Pink\" Floyd in director Richard Linklater's film Dazed and Confused (1993), Jesse in The Rage: Carrie 2 (1999), and Rick Rambis in Out Cold (2001).\n\n\n== Early life ==\nLondon was born in San Diego, California, the son of Debbie (n\u00e9e Osborn), a waitress, and Frank London, a sheet metal worker.

It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, which is separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill. It was founded toward the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest. The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was initially a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new Norman ruling class. The castle was also used as a prison from 1100 (Ranulf Flambard) until 1952 (Kray twins), although that was not its primary purpose. A grand palace early in its history, it served as a royal residence. As a whole, the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat. There were several phases of expansion, mainly under kings Richard I, Henry III, and Edward I in the 12th and 13th centuries. The general layout established by the late 13th century remains despite later activity on the site.\nThe Tower of London has played a prominent role in English history. It was besieged several times, and controlling it has been important to controlling the country. The Tower has served variously as an armoury, a treasury, a menagerie, the home of the Royal Mint, a public record office, and the home of the Crown Jewels of England. From the early 14th century until the reign of Charles II in the 17th century, the monarch would traditionally prepare for several nights at the Tower, and lead a procession from there to Westminster Abbey for their coronation. In the absence of the monarch, the Constable of the Tower was in charge of the castle. This was a powerful and trusted position in the medieval period. In the late 15th century, the Princes in the Tower were housed at the castle when they mysteriously disappeared, presumed murdered. Under the Tudors, the Tower became used less as a royal residence, and despite attempts to refortify and repair the castle, its defences lagged behind developments to deal with artillery.\nThe zenith of the castle's use as a prison was the 16th and 17th centuries, when many figures who had fallen into disgrace, such as Elizabeth I before she became queen, Sir Walter Raleigh, and Elizabeth Throckmorton, were held within its walls. This use has led to the phrase \"sent to the Tower\". Despite its enduring reputation as a place of torture and death, popularised by 16th-century religious propagandists and 19th-century writers, only seven people were executed within the Tower before the world wars of the 20th century. Executions were more commonly held on the notorious Tower Hill to the north of the castle, with 112 occurring there over a 400-year period. In the latter half of the 19th century, institutions such as the Royal Mint moved out of the castle to other locations, leaving many buildings empty. Anthony Salvin and John Taylor took the opportunity to restore the Tower to what was felt to be its medieval appearance, clearing out many of the vacant post-medieval structures.\nIn the First and Second World Wars, the Tower was again used as a prison and witnessed the executions of 12 men for espionage. After the Second World War, damage caused during the Blitz was repaired, and the castle reopened to the public. Today, the Tower of London is one of the country's most popular tourist attractions. Under the ceremonial charge of the Constable of the Tower, operated by the Resident Governor of the Tower of London and Keeper of the Jewel House, and guarded by the Yeomen Warders, the property is cared for by the charity Historic Royal Palaces and is protected as a World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Layout ===\n\nThe Tower was oriented with its strongest and most impressive defences overlooking Saxon London, which archaeologist Alan Vince suggests\nThe London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) is a public research university in London, England, and a member institution of the University of London. The school specialises in the social sciences. Founded in 1895 by Fabian Society members Sidney Webb, Beatrice Webb, Graham Wallas and George Bernard Shaw, LSE joined the University of London in 1900 and established its first degree courses under the auspices of the university in 1901. LSE began awarding its degrees in its own name in 2008, prior to which it awarded degrees of the University of London. It became a university in its own right within the University of London in 2022.\nLSE is located in the London Borough of Camden and Westminster, Central London, near the boundary between Covent Garden and Holborn. The area is historically known as Clare Market. LSE has more than 11,000 students, just under seventy percent of whom come from outside the UK, and 3,300 staff. The university has the sixth-largest endowment of any university in the UK and in 2022/23, it had an income of \u00a3466.1 million of which \u00a339.6 million was from research grants. Despite its name, the school is organised into 25 academic departments and institutes which conduct teaching and research across a range of pure and applied social sciences.\nLSE is a member of the Russell Group, Association of Commonwealth Universities and the European University Association, and is typically considered part of the \"golden triangle\" of research universities in the south east of England. The LSE also forms part of CIVICA \u2013 The European University of Social Sciences, a network of eight European universities focused on research in the social sciences. The 2025 Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide ranked the London School of Economics as the number one university in the United Kingdom and named it their University of the Year. In the 2021 Research Excellence Framework, the school had the third highest grade point average in the United Kingdom (joint with the University of Cambridge).\nLSE alumni and faculty include 55 past or present heads of state or government and 20 Nobel laureates. As of 2024, 15 out of 56 Nobel Memorial Prizes in Economics had been awarded to LSE alumni, current staff, or former staff. LSE alumni and faculty have also won 3 Nobel Peace Prizes and 2 Nobel Prizes in Literature. The university has educated the most billionaires (11) of any European university according to a 2014 global census of US dollar billionaires.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe London School of Economics and Political Science was founded in 1895 by Beatrice and Sidney Webb, initially funded by a bequest of \u00a320,000 from the estate of Henry Hunt Hutchinson. Hutchinson, a lawyer and member of the Fabian Society, left the money in trust, to be put \"towards advancing its [The Fabian Society's] objects in any way they [the trustees] deem advisable\". The five trustees were Sidney Webb, Edward Pease, Constance Hutchinson, W. S. de Mattos and William Clark.\nLSE records that the proposal to establish the school was conceived during a breakfast meeting on 4 August 1894, between the Webbs, Louis Flood, and George Bernard Shaw. The proposal was accepted by the trustees in February 1895 and LSE held its first classes in October of that year, in rooms at 9 John Street, Adelphi, in the City of Westminster.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nThe school joined the federal University of London in 1900 and was recognised as a Faculty of Economics of the university. The University of London degrees of BSc (Econ) and DSc (Econ) were established in 1901, the first university degrees dedicated to the social sciences. Expanding rapidly over the following years, the school moved initially to the nearby 10 Adelphi Terrace, then to Clare Market and Houghton Street. The foundation stone of the Old Building, on Houghton Street, was laid by King George V in 1920; the building was opened in 1922.\nThe school's arms, including its motto and beaver mascot, \nThe London boroughs are the 32 local authority districts that together with the City of London make up the administrative area of Greater London, England; each is governed by a London borough council. The present London boroughs were all created at the same time as Greater London on 1 April 1965 by the London Government Act 1963 (c. 33) and are a type of local government district. Twelve were designated as Inner London boroughs and twenty as Outer London boroughs. The City of London, the historic centre, is a separate ceremonial county and sui generis local government district that functions quite differently from a London borough. However, the two counties together comprise the administrative area of Greater London as well as the London Region, all of which is also governed by the Greater London Authority, under the Mayor of London.\nThe London boroughs have populations of between 150,000 and 400,000. Inner London boroughs tend to be smaller, in both population and area, and more densely populated than Outer London boroughs. The London boroughs were created by combining groups of former local government units. A review undertaken between 1987 and 1992 led to a number of relatively small alterations in borough boundaries. London borough councils provide the majority of local government services (schools, waste management, social services, libraries), in contrast to the strategic Greater London Authority, which has limited authority over all of Greater London.\nThe councils were first elected in 1964, and acted as shadow authorities until 1 April 1965. Each borough is divided into electoral wards, subject to periodic review, for the purpose of electing councillors. Council elections take place every four years, with the most recent elections in 2022, and the next elections due in 2026. The political make-up of London borough councils is dominated by the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat parties. Twenty-eight councils follow the leader and cabinet model of executive governance, while five have directly elected mayors (Croydon, Hackney, Lewisham, Newham, and Tower Hamlets). The City of London is instead governed by the City of London Corporation (and the Inner and Middle Temples, which are not governed by the City of London Corporation).\n\n\n== List ==\n\nThere are four boroughs that do not have \"London Borough\" in their official names: the City of Westminster, and the Royal Boroughs of Kingston upon Thames, Kensington and Chelsea, and Greenwich.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Creation ===\nFrom the mid-1930s, the Greater London area comprised four types of local government authorities. There were county boroughs, municipal boroughs, urban districts and metropolitan boroughs. The large county boroughs provided all local government services and held the powers usually invested in county councils. The municipal borough and urban district authorities had fewer powers. The situation was made more complex because county councils could delegate functions such as elementary education and library provision to the municipal borough and district councils, and this was implemented piecemeal. Reform of London local government sought to regularise this arrangement.\nThe Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London was established in 1957 and the report was published on 19 October 1960. It proposed 52 \"Greater London Boroughs\" with a population range of 100,000 to 250,000. This was made up of a mixture of whole existing units, mergers of two or three areas, and two boroughs formed as the result of a split. In December 1961 the government proposed that there would be 34 boroughs rather than 52, and detailed their boundaries. The proposed number was further reduced to 32 in 1962.\nOn 1 April 1965, the 32 London boroughs and Greater London were created by the London Government Act 1963. Twelve boroughs in the former County of London area were designated Inner London boroughs and the 20 others were designated Outer London boroughs.
