{"page_content": "The UEFA Champions League (abbreviated as UCL) is an annual club association football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) that is contested by top-division European clubs. The competition begins with a round robin league phase to qualify for the double-legged knockout rounds, and a single-leg final. It is the most-watched club competition in the world and the third most-watched football competition overall, behind only the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations.\nIntroduced in 1955 as the Coupe des Clubs Champions Europ\u00e9ens (French for European Champion Clubs' Cup), and commonly known as the European Cup, it was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the champions of Europe's domestic leagues, with its winner reckoned as the European club champion. The competition took on its current name in 1992, adding a round-robin group stage in 1991 and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries since the 1997\u201398 season. While only the winners of many of Europe's national leagues can enter the competition, the top 5 leagues by coefficient provide four teams each by default, with a possibility for additional spots based on performance during the previous season. Clubs that finish below the qualifying spots are eligible for the second-tier UEFA Europa League competition, and since 2021, for the third-tier UEFA Conference League.\nIn its present format, the Champions League begins in early July with three qualifying rounds and a play-off round, all played over two legs. The seven surviving teams enter the league phase, joining 29 teams qualified in advance. The 36 teams each play eight opponents, four home and four away. The 24 highest-ranked teams proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with the final match in late May or early June. The winner of the Champions League automatically qualifies for the following year's Champions League, the UEFA Super Cup, and the FIFA Club World Cup.\nSpanish clubs have the most victories (20 wins), followed by England (15 wins) and Italy (12 wins). England has the most winning teams, with six clubs having won the title. The competition has been won by 23 clubs and 13 of them have won it more than once. Real Madrid is the most successful club in the tournament's history, having won it 15 times. Madrid is the only club to have won it five times in a row (the first five editions). Only one club has won all of their matches in a single tournament en route to the tournament victory: Bayern Munich in the 2019\u201320 season. Real Madrid is the current European champion, having beaten Borussia Dortmund 2\u20130 in the 2024 final for their fifteenth title.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first time the champions of two European leagues met was in what was nicknamed the 1895 World Championship, when English champions Sunderland beat Scottish champions Heart of Midlothian 5\u20133. The first pan-European tournament was the Challenge Cup, a competition between clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Three years later, in 1900, the champions of Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland, which were the only existing leagues in continental Europe at the time, participated in the Coupe Van der Straeten Ponthoz, thus being dubbed as the \"club championship of the continent\" by the local newspapers.\nThe Mitropa Cup, a competition modelled after the Challenge Cup, was created in 1927, an idea of Austrian Hugo Meisl, and played between Central European clubs. In 1930, the Coupe des Nations (French: Nations Cup), the first attempt to create a cup for national champion clubs of Europe, was played and organised by Swiss club Servette. Held in Geneva, it brought together ten champions from across the continent. The tournament was won by \u00dajpes\nThe 2024\u201325 UEFA Champions League is the 70th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 33rd season since it was rebranded from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. This will be the first season under a new format, with 36 participating teams that play eight games each against different opponents in a league phase, all the teams being ranked in a joint group. This will increase the total number of matches played in the competition from 125 to 189 (excluding qualifying rounds).\nThe final will be played on 31 May 2025 at Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany. The winners of the 2024\u201325 UEFA Champions League will automatically qualify for the 2025\u201326 UEFA Champions League league phase, the 2025 FIFA Intercontinental Cup, the 2029 FIFA Club World Cup, and earn the right to play against the winners of the 2024\u201325 UEFA Europa League in the 2025 UEFA Super Cup.\nReal Madrid are the defending champions, having won their record-extending 15th title last season.\n\n\n== Association team allocation ==\nA total of 81 teams from 53 of the 55 UEFA member associations are set to participate in the 2024\u201325 UEFA Champions League (the exceptions being Liechtenstein which does not organise a domestic league and Russia which is currently suspended). The association ranking based on the UEFA association coefficients is used to determine the number of participating teams for each association:\n\nAssociations 1\u20135 each have four teams.\nAssociation 6 has three teams.\nAssociations 7\u201315 each have two teams.\nAssociations 16\u201355 (except Liechtenstein and Russia) each have one team.\nThe winners of the 2023\u201324 UEFA Champions League and 2023\u201324 UEFA Europa League were each given an additional entry if they did not qualify for the 2024\u201325 UEFA Champions League through their domestic league.\nThe two associations who obtained the most coefficient points in the 2023\u201324 season will each have one European Performance Spot into the league phase. The winners of the UEFA Champions League and Europa League could not fill the European Performance Spots.\n\n\n=== Association ranking ===\nFor the 2024\u201325 UEFA Champions League, the associations were allocated places according to their 2023 UEFA association coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2018\u201319 to 2022\u201323. The table reflects Russia's ongoing suspension from UEFA.\nApart from the allocation based on the association coefficients, associations could have additional teams participating in the Champions League, as noted below:\n\n(EPS) \u2013 European Performance Spot, the additional berths for associations who finished in the top 2 of the 2023\u201324 association coefficients\n(TH) \u2013 Additional berth for UEFA Champions League title holders\n(EL) \u2013 Additional berth for UEFA Europa League title holders\n\n\n=== Distribution ===\n\nThe information here reflects the suspension of Russia in European football, and so the following changes to the default access list were made:\n\nThe champions of associations 23 (Sweden) and 24 (Poland) entered the second qualifying round instead of the first qualifying round (Champions Path).\nAs the Champions League title holders (Real Madrid) qualified via their domestic league's standard berth allocation, the following changes to the default access list were made:\n\nShakhtar Donetsk as the club with the highest club coefficient that would otherwise have entered the Champions Path of the qualifying phase or play-off round, entered the league phase instead of the Champions Path play-off round.\nDinamo Zagreb, as the club with the highest club coefficient that would otherwise have entered the Champions Path second qualifying round, entered the Champions Path play-off round.\nFerencv\u00e1ros and Qaraba\u011f, as the two clubs with the highest club coefficient that would otherwise have entered the Champions Path first qualifying round, entered the Champions Path second qualifying round.\nAs the Europa League title holders (Atalanta) qua\nThe 2024 UEFA Champions League final was the final match of the 2023\u201324 UEFA Champions League, the 69th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 32nd season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. It was held at Wembley Stadium in London, England, on 1 June 2024, between German club Borussia Dortmund and Spanish club Real Madrid. Due to the postponement and relocation of the 2020 final, the final hosts were shifted back a year, with London instead hosting the 2024 final.\nReal Madrid won the match 2\u20130 for a record-extending 15th title, and their sixth in eleven seasons. As winners, they earned a spot to play in the 2024 UEFA Super Cup, against the winners of the 2023\u201324 UEFA Europa League, Atalanta. They also earned a chance to compete in the inaugural edition of the FIFA Intercontinental Cup. As they had already qualified for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup by winning the same tournament two years ago, the spot intended for the winners was redistributed via the UEFA club ranking, with Dortmund claiming one of those spots.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFor Borussia Dortmund, this was their third UEFA Champions League final appearance, the first since the 1\u20132 Der Klassiker loss against Bayern Munich in 2013, which was also held at Wembley Stadium, and the first European final for manager Edin Terzi\u0107. Additionally, Dortmund played one European Cup Winners' Cup final (winning in 1966) and two UEFA Cup finals (losing in 1993 and 2002).\nReal Madrid played in a record-extending 18th European Cup/UEFA Champions League final, and their second in three years. They previously won 14 finals (in 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1966, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2022) and lost three (1962, 1964 and 1981). Their manager Carlo Ancelotti reached a record-extending sixth UEFA Champions League final as manager, winning in 2003 and 2007 and losing in 2005 while in charge of Milan, and winning the 2014 and 2022 finals with Real Madrid. Real Madrid also played in two European Cup Winners' Cup finals (losing in 1971 and 1983) and two UEFA Cup finals (winning in 1985 and 1986).\nThis was the first Champions League final between the two clubs, and their first meeting in European competitions since the 2017\u201318 Champions League group stage encounters, when Madrid won 3\u20131 away and 3\u20132 at home. Of their previous fourteen encounters, Dortmund won three matches, Real won six matches and five finished as a draw.\nUntil the semi-finals, Borussia Dortmund had the best defence in the 2023\u201324 Champions League with six clean sheets and eight goals conceded. In contrast, Real Madrid goalkeepers had the most goal-scoring opportunities to prevent in the same season.\n\n\n=== Previous finals ===\nIn the following table, finals until 1992 were in the European Cup era, since 1993 were in the UEFA Champions League era.\n\n\n== Venue ==\nThis was the third UEFA Champions League final to take place at the rebuilt Wembley Stadium, having previously been held in 2011 and 2013. Overall, it was the eighth final to be held in London, with the other five matches taking place at the original Wembley Stadium in 1963, 1968, 1971, 1978, and 1992. The match was the ninth European Cup final held in England, with the 2003 final having been held at Old Trafford in Manchester, equalling the record of nine European Cup finals held in each of Italy, Germany and Spain. It was also the thirteenth held in the United Kingdom, with the 1960, 1976 and 2002 finals held in Scotland and the 2017 final held in Wales. Wembley Stadium was also a host venue at UEFA Euro 2020, with eight matches played at the stadium including the semi-finals and final.\n\n\n=== Host selection ===\nAn open bidding process was launched on 22 February 2019 by UEFA to select the 2022 and 2023 UEFA Champions League final venues. Associations had until 22 March 2019 to express interest, and bid dossiers had to be submitted by 1 July 2019.\nThe Football \nThe UEFA Champions League is a seasonal football competition established in 1955. Prior to the 1992\u201393 season, the tournament was named the European Cup. The UEFA Champions League is open to the league champions of all UEFA (Union of European Football Associations) member associations (except Liechtenstein, which has no league competition), as well as to the clubs finishing from second to fourth position in the strongest leagues. Originally, only the champions of their respective national league and the defending champions of the competition were allowed to participate. However, this was changed in 1997 to allow the runners-up of the stronger leagues to compete as well, and again in 1999 when third and fourth-placed teams of the said leagues also became eligible. In the Champions League era, the defending champions of the competition did not automatically qualify until the rules were changed in 2005 to allow title holders Liverpool to enter the competition.\nTeams that have won the UEFA Champions League three consecutive times, or five times overall, receive a multiple-winner badge. Six teams have earned this privilege: Real Madrid, Ajax, Bayern Munich, AC Milan, Liverpool, and Barcelona. Until 2009, clubs that had earned that badge were allowed to keep the European Champion Clubs' Cup and a new one was commissioned; since 2009, the winning team each year has received a full-size replica of the trophy, while the original is retained by UEFA.\nA total of 23 clubs have won the Champions League/European Cup. Real Madrid holds the record for the most victories, having won the competition 15 times, including the inaugural edition. They have also won the competition the most consecutive times, with five straight titles from 1956 to 1960. Juventus have been runners-up the most times, losing seven finals. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid is the only team to reach three finals without having won the trophy while Reims and Valencia have finished as runners-up twice without winning. Spain has provided the most champions, with twenty wins from two clubs. England have produced fifteen winners from a record six clubs and Italy have produced twelve winners from three clubs. English teams were banned from the competition for five years following the Heysel disaster in 1985. The current champions are Real Madrid, who beat Borussia Dortmund 2\u20130 in the 2024 final.\nWhile the venue for the final is chosen well in advance, on four occasions clubs have reached a final scheduled to be played in their own stadium; Real Madrid won their second European Cup in the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium in 1957, while in 1965 Inter Milan also won their second title in the final at the San Siro. In 1984, the Stadio Olimpico in Rome was the venue and saw Roma defeated on penalties by Liverpool, while 2012 saw the Allianz Arena host the final between Bayern Munich and Chelsea, which the English club also won on penalties.\n\n\n== List of finals ==\n\nThe \"Season\" column refers to the season the competition was held, and wikilinks to the article about that season.\nThe wikilinks in the \"Score\" column point to the article about that season's final game.\n\n\n== Performances ==\n\n\n=== By club ===\n\n\n=== By nation ===\nTeams from thirteen nations have appeared in a Champions League final, and teams from ten of those have won the competition. Since the 1995\u201396 season, other than Porto's win in 2003\u201304, the winners have come from one of only four nations \u2013 Spain (13), England (7), Germany (4) and Italy (4) \u2013 and other than Monaco in 2003\u201304 and Paris Saint-Germain in 2019\u201320, the runners-up have all come from the same four nations.\nEngland has produced the most winning teams, with six clubs having won the trophy. Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands have produced three winners, while Spain and Portugal have produced two winning clubs. Scotland, Romania, Yugoslavia, and France have produced one winner each. \n\n\n== See also ==\nList of European Cup and UEFA Champions League winning managers\nList of UEFA Cup and\nThe UEFA Women's Champions League, previously called the UEFA Women's Cup (2001\u20132009), is a European women's association football competition. It involves the top club teams from countries affiliated with the European governing body UEFA.\n\nThe competition was first played in 2001\u201302 under the name UEFA Women's Cup, and renamed the Champions League for the 2009\u201310 edition. The most significant changes in 2009 were the inclusion of runners-up from the top eight ranked nations, a one-off final as opposed to the two-legged finals in previous years, and \u2013 until 2018 \u2013 playing the final in the same city as the men's UEFA Champions League final. In the 2021\u201322 season, the competition proper included a group stage for the first time in the Women's Champions League era.\nLyon is the most successful club in the competition's history, winning the title eight times, including five consecutive titles from 2016 to 2020. Barcelona are the current champions, having beaten Lyon in the 2024 final.\nThe idea of creating two new women's European Cups is regularly raised to offer more matches.\n\n\n== Format ==\n\n\n=== UEFA Women's Cup (2001\u20132009) ===\nFor the tournament's first 3 editions, a preliminary round was first played to reduce teams to 32. Starting in the second season, this stage grouped teams into mini-tournaments of four teams, whose winners advanced to the second qualifying round, sometimes called the group stage. The group stage was eight groups of four, each group held as a round-robin in a single country, whose winners advanced to the quarter-finals.\nFrom the 2004\u201305 season, the first qualifying stage was expanded to 9 groups of 4, again playing a round-robin in a single location.  Seven teams got a bye to the group stage. (in 2007\u201308, it was 10 groups of 4, advancing winners plus one runner-up, with 5 teams getting a bye). The group stage was then played among only 16 teams in four groups of four, each group in a single host country, with the top two teams in each group advancing to the quarter-finals.\nThe knock-out rounds were played as two-legged home-and-home matches, including the final (except for the first final).\n\n\n=== Champions League (2009\u20132021) ===\nOn 11 December 2008, UEFA announced that the competition would be reformatted and renamed to the UEFA Women's Champions League beginning with the 2009-10 competition. As in the men's game, the new tournament aimed to include runners-up of the top women's football leagues in Europe. \nThe competition was opened to the champions of all 55 UEFA associations that had a qualifying women's league. Due to the varying participation, the number of teams playing the qualifying round changed from year to year. Numbers were based on three principles:\n\nQualifying rounds are contested by groups of 4 teams.\nGroup winners, plus the smallest possible number of runners-up, qualify for the Round of 32.\nTeams from the top associations would enter directly into the Round of 32.\nCompetition from the Round of 32 onwards would be in the form of home-and-home pairings using the away goals rule, except for the single-legged final.\n\n\n==== Minor adjustments ====\nWhen the new format was initially announced, the eight top countries according to the UEFA league coefficient were awarded two places in the league, with runners-up participating in the qualifying rounds.\nFor the 2011\u201312 tournament, the runners-up from the top eight nations instead qualified directly to the R32. For the five years under this format, seven nations remained in the top eight: Germany, Sweden, England, France, Denmark, Russia, and Italy. A different nation provided the eighth runner-up in each of the five years: Iceland, Norway, Austria, Czech Republic, and Spain in that order.\nThe tournament was expanded for the 2016\u201317 season, with the runners-up from nations 9\u201312 in UEFA league coefficient also qualifying. For the first three years under this format, the four nations in these slots were Czech Republic, Austria, Scotland, and Norway. For t\nThe 2023\u201324 UEFA Champions League was the 69th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 32nd season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League.\nReal Madrid defeated Borussia Dortmund 2\u20130 in the final, which was played at the Wembley Stadium in London, England, for a record-extending 15th European Cup title, and their sixth in eleven years. As winners, Real Madrid earned the right to play against Atalanta, the winners of the 2023\u201324 UEFA Europa League, in the 2024 UEFA Super Cup. They also qualified for the final of the brand-new 2024 FIFA Intercontinental Cup and the expanded 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the United States.\nThis was the final season with the format of 32 teams participating in the group stage, following UEFA's announcement of a new expanded format introduced in the following edition.\nManchester City were the defending champions, but were eliminated by eventual winners Real Madrid in the quarter-finals.\n\n\n== Association team allocation ==\nA total of 78 teams from 53 of the 55 UEFA member associations participated in the 2023\u201324 UEFA Champions League (the exceptions being Liechtenstein, which did not organise a domestic league, and Russia). The association ranking based on the UEFA association coefficients was used to determine the number of participating teams for each association:\n\nAssociations 1\u20134 each had four teams qualify.\nAssociations 5\u20136 each had three teams qualify.\nAssociations 7\u201315 (except Russia) each had two teams qualify.\nAssociations 16\u201355 (except Liechtenstein) each had one team qualify.\nThe winners of the 2022\u201323 UEFA Champions League and 2022\u201323 UEFA Europa League were each given an additional entry if they did not qualify for the 2023\u201324 UEFA Champions League through their domestic league.\n\n\n=== Association ranking ===\nFor the 2023\u201324 UEFA Champions League, the associations were allocated places according to their 2022 UEFA association coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2017\u201318 to 2021\u201322. The team allocation reflected Russia's ongoing suspension from UEFA competitions.\nApart from the allocation based on the association coefficients, associations could have additional teams (a maximum of 5 per association) participating in the Champions League, as noted below:\n\n(UEL) \u2013 Additional berth for UEFA Europa League title holders\n\n\n=== Distribution ===\nThe following is the default access list for the 2023\u201324 season.\n\nDue to the suspension of Russia for the 2023\u201324 European season, the following changes to the access list were made:\n\nThe champions of association 11 (Serbia) entered the group stage instead of the play-off round (Champions Path).\nThe champions of association 13 (Belgium) entered the play-off round instead of the third qualifying round (Champions Path).\nThe champions of association 15 (Greece) entered the third qualifying round instead of the second qualifying round (Champions Path).\nThe champions of associations 18 (Denmark) and 19 (Croatia) entered the second qualifying round instead of the first qualifying round (Champions Path).\nThe runner-up of association 11 (Serbia) entered the third qualifying round instead of the second qualifying round (League Path).\nSince the Champions League title holders (Manchester City) qualified via their domestic league, the following changes to the access list were made:\n\nThe champions of association 12 (Ukraine) entered the group stage instead of the play-off round (Champions Path).\nThe champions of association 14 (Switzerland) entered the play-off round instead of the third qualifying round (Champions Path).\nThe champions of association 16 (Czech Republic) entered the third qualifying round instead of the second qualifying round (Champions Path).\nThe champions of associations 20 (Turkey) and 21 (Cyprus) entered the second qualifying round instead of the first qualifying round (Champions Path).\n\n\n=== Teams ===\nThe labels in\nThis page details all statistics of all seasons of the European Cup and Champions League.

Season in bold represents teams qualified for the knockout phase that season. Between 1999\u20132000 and 2002\u201303, qualification is considered from the second group stage. Starting from the 2024\u201325 season with the introduction of a league phase, the top eight are considered to be qualified as well as the eight play-off winners.\n\nEuropean Cup group stage participants\n(only one season was played in this format)\n1991\u201392:\n\n Anderlecht\n Barcelona\n Benfica\n Dynamo Kyiv\n Panathinaikos\n Red Star Belgrade\n Sampdoria\nSampdoria is the only side to have played in 1991\u201392 European Cup group stage, but to have not played in the Champions League group stage.\n Sparta Prague\n\n\n=== Goals ===\nMost goals scored in a matchday: 63 (matchday 1 of the first group stage, 2000\u201301 season).\nMost goals scored in a season: 449 (2000\u201301 season).\n\n\n=== Host of the finals ===\nThe city that has hosted the final the most times is London, doing so on eight occasions. Of these, five have been played at the original Wembley Stadium and thrice at the new Wembley Stadium. Paris come joint second, having hosted six finals.\nThe nations that have hosted the most finals are Italy and England, with nine each: Milan and Rome four times each and Bari once for Italy; London eight times and Manchester once for England. Spain (Madrid five times, Barcelona twice and Sevilla once) and Germany (Munich four times, Stuttgart twice, Berlin and Gelsenkirchen once each) come second with eight each.\nThe original Wembley Stadium has a record for the stadium that has hosted the most final matches, with five times (1963, 1968, 1971, 1978 and 1992). Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, Heysel Stadium, San Siro and Stadio Olimpico come second with four times each.\nThe nation that has hosted the finals with most different stadiums is Germany, with five stadiums (Neckarstadion, Munich Olympiastadion, Arena AufSchalke, Allianz Arena and Berlin Olympiastadion).

It was originally scheduled to be played at the Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany. However, due to the postponement and relocation of the 2020 final, the hosts were shifted back a year, with Saint Petersburg scheduled to host the 2022 final. Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine which commenced in February 2022, the final was eventually moved to Saint-Denis. As the winners, Real Madrid automatically qualified for the 2022\u201323 UEFA Champions League group stage, as well as earning the right to play against the winners of the 2021\u201322 UEFA Europa League, Eintracht Frankfurt, in the 2022 UEFA Super Cup and participate in the 2022 FIFA Club World Cup, both of which they went on to win.\nChelsea were the defending champions, but they were eliminated in the quarter-finals by eventual winners Real Madrid.\nThis season was the first since 1999\u20132000 (the first season after the dissolution of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup) where three major European club competitions (UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and the newly created UEFA Europa Conference League) are organised by UEFA. No changes were made to the format of the Champions League, but teams that were eliminated from the preliminary round and first qualifying round of the Champions League were now transferred to the Europa Conference League instead of the Europa League.\nOn 24 June 2021, UEFA approved the proposal to abolish the away goals rule in all UEFA club competitions, which had been used since 1965. Accordingly, if in a two-legged tie two teams scored the same number of aggregate goals, the winner of the tie would not be decided by the number of away goals scored by each team but always by 30 minutes of extra time, and if the two teams scored the same number of goals in extra time, the winner would be decided by a penalty shoot-out.\n\n\n== Association team allocation ==\nA total of 80 teams from 54 of the 55 UEFA member associations participated in the 2021\u201322 UEFA Champions League (the exception being Liechtenstein, which did not organise a domestic league).

Therefore, the changes to the access list that should be made based on the Champions League and Europa League title holders could not be certain until matches of the earlier qualifying rounds had been played and/or their draws had been made. UEFA used \"adaptive re-balancing\"\nThe UEFA Champions League, known until 1992 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup or colloquially as the European Cup, is an annual association football cup competition organised by UEFA since 1955. Originally a straight knockout competition open only to champion clubs, the tournament was expanded during the 1990s to incorporate a round-robin group phase and more teams. The expansion resulted in more games being played, increasing players' goalscoring chances; thus the rankings are weighted in favour of modern players: only seven out of the 52 players on the list never competed in the reformed Champions League.\nWith 140 goals, Cristiano Ronaldo is currently the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, while his career rival Lionel Messi is the only other player to have reached triple figures. Ronaldo has also finished as the top scorer for the most individual seasons in the competition's history, doing so seven times.\nThe title of highest goalscorer had previously been held by Ra\u00fal, who scored his 50th goal in 2005 while at Real Madrid to overtake Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano. He held the record until November 2014, when his eventual tally of 71 was first equalled and then surpassed by Messi. Ronaldo has remained the competition's outright top scorer since September 2015; after a back-and-forth exchange of the record between him and Messi, a hat-trick by the former against Shakhtar Donetsk put Ronaldo ahead with 80 goals, and he would not relinquish the top spot again after this.\n\n\n== All-time top scorers ==\nAs of 6 November 2024\nA \u2021 indicates the player was from the European Cup era.\nPlayers taking part in the 2024\u201325 UEFA Champions League are highlighted in bold.\nThe table below does not include goals scored in the qualification stage of the competition.\n\n\n== Top scorers by season ==\nThe table below does not include goals scored in the qualification stage of the competition.\n\n\n=== By player ===\n\n\n=== By club ===\n\nNotes\n\n\n=== By country ===\n\nNotes\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of footballers with 100 or more UEFA Champions League appearances\nList of UEFA Champions League hat-tricks\nList of UEFA Cup and Europa League top scorers\nList of UEFA Cup Winners' Cup top scorers\n\n\n== References ==\nThe 2023 UEFA Champions League final was the final match of the 2022\u201323 UEFA Champions League, the 68th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA.

As winners, Manchester City earned the right to play against Sevilla, the winners of the 2022\u201323 UEFA Europa League, in the 2023 UEFA Super Cup, as well as qualifying for the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup; they went on to win both competitions. They also qualified for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup through UEFA's champions pathway (winners of the 2021\u20132024 Champions Leagues).\nThe final was originally scheduled to be played at Wembley Stadium in London, England. However, due to the postponement and relocation of the 2020 final because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the scheduled hosts for subsequent finals were shifted back a year, and the Allianz Arena in Munich was assigned the 2023 final. When the 2021 final, which had been scheduled to be played in Istanbul, also had to be relocated due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2023 final was given to Istanbul instead, and Munich received the 2025 final.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nFor Manchester City, this was their third European final and second UEFA Champions League final appearance; they won the 1970 European Cup Winners' Cup final but lost the 2021 UEFA Champions League final 1\u20130 to Chelsea, who were the most recent new European champions, having won in 2012. Manager Pep Guardiola was looking to win his third UEFA Champions League title and the first since 2011 with former employers Barcelona, when they beat Manchester United 3\u20131 at Wembley Stadium. He was also aiming to become the first manager to win two European trebles, having done so with Barcelona in 2008\u201309. Additionally, Manchester City were attempting to secure the continental treble, having earlier won the Premier League and FA Cup. After West Ham United's triumph in the 2023 UEFA Europa Conference League final three days earlier, they became the English team with the longest European major trophy drought\u201453 years since their latest triumph. \nOn the other hand, this was Inter Milan's eighth European final and sixth UEFA Champions League final appearance, having won 3\u20131 in 1964 against Real Madrid, 1\u20130 against Benfica at their home ground the San Siro in 1965, and 2\u20130 against Bayern Munich in 2010\u2014resulting in Inter completing the continental treble; they also lost 2\u20131 to Celtic in 1967 and 2\u20130 to Ajax in 1972. Inter was also the most recent Italian club to win the Champions League; since 2010 only one other Italian club\u2014Juventus\u2014had reached the Champions League final, losing in 2015 and 2017. Having won the 2023 Coppa Italia final against Fiorentina, Inter were attempting to win a cup double. Manager Simone Inzaghi was aiming for his first European title as manager and the second in his football career, having won against Manchester United in the 1999 UEFA Super Cup as a Lazio player. Their midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan was aiming to become the 11th player to have won all three major European trophies and the first to have achieved that with three different clubs, having won the 2016\u201317 UEFA Europa League with Manchester United and the 2021\u201322 UEFA Europa Conference League with Roma.\nThis was the first meeting in UEFA competitions between Manchester City and Inter Milan.

In addition, the Germans secured their second continental treble, becoming only the second European club to do so, and became the first team to claim any European competition with a 100% winning record. As winners, they earned the right to play against Sevilla, the winners of the 2019\u201320 UEFA Europa League, in the 2020 UEFA Super Cup, and also qualified for the 2020 FIFA Club World Cup in Qatar. They would go on to win both competitions.

If two or more teams are equal on points upon completion of the league phase, the following tiebreaking criteria are applied, in the order given, to determine their rankings:\n\nGoal difference;\nGoals scored;\nAway goals scored;\nWins;\nAway wins;\nHigher number of points obtained collectively by league phase opponents;\nSuperior collective goal difference of league phase opponents;\nHigher number of goals scored collectively by league phase opponents;\nLower disciplinary points total (direct red card = 3 points, yellow card = 1 point, expulsion for two yellow cards in one match = 3 points);\nUEFA club coefficient.\nDuring the league phase, criteria 1 to 5 will be used to rank teams who have an equal number of points. Should any teams be equal on points and tied on the first five criteria, they will be considered equal in position and sorted alphabetically. Criteria 6 to 10 will only be used to break ties upon completion of all matches.\n\n\n== Teams and seeding ==\nThe 36 teams were divided into four pots of nine teams each, with the Champions League title holders automatically placed as the top seed of pot 1. All remaining teams were allocated to pots based on their 2024 UEFA club coefficients. The participants include:\n\n29 teams which entered at this stage\n7 winners of the play-off round (5 from the Champions Path, 2 from the League Path)\n\nNotes\n\n\n== Draw ==\nThe draw for the league phase pairings was held at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco on 29 August 2024, 18:00 CEST. All 36 teams were manually drawn using physical balls. For every team manually drawn, automated software digitally drew their opponents at random, determining which of their matches were at home and which ones away. Each team will face two opponents from each of the four pots, one of which they will face at home and one away. Teams could not face opponents from their own association, and could only be drawn against a maximum of two sides from the same association. The draw started with Pot 1, assigning opponents to all teams, one after the other, and continued with the other pots in ascending order until all teams were assigned their opponents.\nThe switch to a primarily computer-based draw was made due to issues with the complexity and duration required by a manual draw. The draw software, developed by AE Live, guaranteed total randomness within the framework of the dra\nThe 2018\u201319 UEFA Champions League was the 64th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 27th season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. For the first time, the video assistant referee (VAR) system was used in the competition from the round of 16 onward.\nThe final was played at the Metropolitano Stadium in Madrid, Spain, between Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool, in the second all-English final after Manchester United beat Chelsea in 2008. Liverpool won the match 2\u20130 to claim their sixth European Cup \u2013 becoming the third ever team to do so, behind Real Madrid in 1966, and Milan in 2003. The win gave Liverpool automatic qualification for the 2019\u201320 UEFA Champions League group stage and the right to play in the 2019 UEFA Super Cup and the 2019 FIFA Club World Cup, the latter two of which they won. As Chelsea and Arsenal also reached the 2019 UEFA Europa League final, this was the first season to have multiple finals of major European club competitions featuring teams from a single nation.\nDefending champions Real Madrid, who had won four of the last five titles, including each of the last three, were eliminated by Ajax in the round of 16. Although Ajax was eliminated in the semi-finals, they had played more matches than any other team in the tournament due to entering in the second qualifying round.\n\n\n== Format changes ==\nOn 9 December 2016, UEFA confirmed the reforming plan for the UEFA Champions League for the 2018\u20132021 cycle, which was announced on 26 August 2016. As per the new regulations, the previous season's UEFA Europa League winners will qualify automatically for the UEFA Champions League group stage (previously they would qualify for the play-off round, but would be promoted to the group stage only if the Champions League title holder berth was vacated, although this promotion to the group stage had been made in all three seasons since it was established from 2015\u20132016). Meanwhile, the top four teams from the leagues of the four top-ranked national associations in the UEFA country coefficients list will qualify automatically for the group stage as well. Only six teams will qualify for the group stage via the qualification rounds, down from ten in the previous season.\nThis was also the first year to feature a preliminary round, in which the representatives of the four bottom-ranked national associations in the UEFA country coefficients contested single-legged semi-finals and a final to determine the final team to enter the first qualifying round.\n\n\n== Association team allocation ==\n79 teams from 54 of the 55 UEFA member associations participated in the 2018\u201319 UEFA Champions League (the exception being Liechtenstein, which did not organise a domestic  league). The association ranking based on the UEFA country coefficients was used to determine the number of participating teams for each association:\n\nAssociations 1\u20134 each had four teams qualify.\nAssociations 5\u20136 each had three teams qualify.\nAssociations 7\u201315 each had two teams qualify.\nAssociations 16\u201355 (except Liechtenstein) each had one team qualify.\nThe winners of the 2017\u201318 UEFA Champions League and 2017\u201318 UEFA Europa League were each given an additional entry if they did not qualify for the 2018\u201319 UEFA Champions League through their domestic league.\nThe winners of the 2017\u201318 UEFA Champions League, Real Madrid, qualified through their domestic league, meaning the additional entry for the Champions League title holders was not necessary.\nThe winners of the 2017\u201318 UEFA Europa League, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, qualified through their domestic league, meaning the additional entry for the Europa League title holders was not necessary.\n\n\n=== Association ranking ===\nFor the 2018\u201319 UEFA Champions League, the associations were allocated places according to their 2017 UEFA country coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2012\u201313 to 2016\u201317.\nApar\nThe 2019 UEFA Champions League final was the final match of the 2018\u201319 UEFA Champions League, the 64th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA and the 27th season since it was rebranded the UEFA Champions League. It was played at the Metropolitano Stadium in Madrid, Spain on 1 June 2019, between English sides Tottenham Hotspur (in their first European Cup final, last having won the UEFA Cup in 1984) and Liverpool (in their ninth overall and their second in a row, having been defeated by Real Madrid in 2018). It was the seventh Champions League final \u2013 and the fourth of the decade \u2013 to feature two teams from the same association, and the second all-English final (the first was in 2008). It was also the first final since 2013 to not feature at least one Spanish team, with Real Madrid and Barcelona having shared the previous five titles between them.\nLiverpool won the final 2\u20130, with a penalty which was scored after 106 seconds by Mohamed Salah, and a goal by substitute Divock Origi after 87 minutes. As winners, for the sixth time in their history, Liverpool earned the right to play in the 2019 FIFA Club World Cup, as well as against Chelsea, the winners of the 2018\u201319 UEFA Europa League, in the 2019 UEFA Super Cup, winning in both competitions. They also secured qualification for the group stage of the 2019\u201320 UEFA Champions League. As Liverpool had already qualified through their league position, the reserved berth was given to Red Bull Salzburg, the champions of the 2018\u201319 Austrian Bundesliga, the 11th-ranked association according to next season's access list.\nIn March 2018, UEFA announced that a fourth substitution would be allowed in extra time and that the number of substitutes would be increased from 7 to 12. The kick-off time was also changed from 20:45 CEST to 21:00 CEST. The match was also the first Champions League final to use the video assistant referee (VAR) system.\n\n\n== Venue ==\n\nThis was the fifth European Cup/UEFA Champions League final held in Madrid, after the 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010 finals, all held at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium.\nThe 67,000-seat Metropolitano Stadium is the home of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, who have occupied it since major renovations were completed in September 2017. Due to UEFA regulations regarding naming rights of non-tournament sponsors, the stadium was referred to as the \"Estadio Metropolitano\" in all UEFA materials.\n\n\n=== Host selection ===\n\nFor the first time, UEFA launched an open bidding process to select the venues of the club competition finals (UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, UEFA Women's Champions League and UEFA Super Cup). The bidding process was opened on 9 December 2016 and associations were given until 27 January 2017 to express interest and 6 June 2017 to submit bid dossiers to UEFA.\n\nUEFA announced on 3 February 2017 that the associations of Azerbaijan and Spain had expressed interest in hosting the Champions League final. On 7 June 2017, UEFA confirmed that they submitted bids for the 2019 UEFA Champions League final, with Azerbaijan proposing the 68,700-seat Baku Olympic Stadium and Spain proposing the then-unfinished Wanda Metropolitano, which would hold 67,000 spectators. The bid evaluation report was published by UEFA on 14 September 2017. The Wanda Metropolitano was selected as the venue by the UEFA Executive Committee on 20 September 2017, while the Baku Olympic Stadium was successful in its bid to host the 2019 UEFA Europa League Final.\n\n\n== Background ==\nTottenham Hotspur reached their first ever Champions League final, becoming the eighth unique finalist from England and the fortieth overall. They were the first final debutants since fellow English and London club Chelsea in 2008. It was the fifth time they had appeared in the final of a UEFA competition, having played in one Cup Winners' Cup final (winning in 1963 to become the first British team to win a European trophy) and three UEFA Cup finals (winning in 1972 and 1984 \nThe 2017\u201318 UEFA Champions League was the 63rd season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 26th season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League.\nThe final was played between Real Madrid and Liverpool at the NSC Olimpiyskiy Stadium in Kyiv, Ukraine. Real Madrid beat Liverpool 3-1 to win a record-extending 13th title, their third title in a row and fourth in five seasons.\nAs winners, Real Madrid qualified as the UEFA representative for the 2018 FIFA Club World Cup in the United Arab Emirates, and also earned the right to play against the winners of the 2017\u201318 UEFA Europa League, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup, winning the former. Additionally, they would have been automatically qualified for the 2018\u201319 UEFA Champions League group stage, but since they had already qualified through their league performance, the berth reserved was given to the champions of the 2017\u201318 Czech First League, the 11th-ranked association according to the 2018\u201319 access list.\nThis edition of the Champions League was particularly influenced by controversial refereeing decisions, such as two clear penalties not given to AS Roma in the semifinal. These controversies were among the reasons that pushed UEFA to introduce VAR in the competition starting from the 2018-19 UEFA Champions League.\n\n\n== Association team allocation ==\n79 teams from 54 of the 55 UEFA member associations participated (the exception being Liechtenstein, which did not organise a domestic league). The association ranking based on the UEFA country coefficients was used to determine the number of participating teams for each association:\n\nAssociations 1\u20133 each had four teams qualify.\nAssociations 4\u20136 each had three teams qualify.\nAssociations 7\u201315 each had two teams qualify.\nAssociations 16\u201355 (except Liechtenstein) each had one team qualify.\nThe winners of the 2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League and 2016\u201317 UEFA Europa League were each given an additional entry if they did not qualify for the 2017\u201318 UEFA Champions League through their domestic league. Because a maximum of five teams from one association could enter the Champions League, if both the Champions League title holders and the Europa League title holders were from the same top three ranked association and finished outside the top four of their domestic league, the fourth-placed team of their association was moved to the Europa League. For this season:\nThe winners of the 2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League, Real Madrid, qualified through their domestic league, meaning the additional entry for the Champions League title holders was not necessary.\nThe winners of the 2016\u201317 UEFA Europa League, Manchester United, did not qualify through their domestic league, meaning the additional entry for the Europa League title holders was necessary.\nKosovo, who became a UEFA member on 3 May 2016, made their debut in the UEFA Champions League.\n\n\n=== Association ranking ===\nFor the 2017\u201318 UEFA Champions League, the associations were allocated places according to their 2016 UEFA country coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2011\u201312 to 2015\u201316.\nApart from the allocation based on the country coefficients, associations could have additional teams participating in the Champions League, as noted below:\n\n(UEL) \u2013 Additional berth for UEFA Europa League title holders\n\n\n=== Distribution ===\nIn the default access list, the Champions League title holders entered the group stage. However, since Real Madrid already qualified for the group stage (as the champions of the 2016\u201317 La Liga), the Champions League title holders berth in the group stage was given to the Europa League title holders, Manchester United. and the following changes to the default allocation system are made:\n\nThe third-placed teams of associations 4 (Italy) and 5 (Portugal) are promoted from the third qualifying round to the play-off round.\n\n\n=== Teams ===\nLeag\nThe 2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League was the 62nd season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 25th season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League.\nThe final was played between Juventus and Real Madrid at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales. It was the second time that the two teams faced each other in the competition's decisive match, having previously met in the 1998 final. Real Madrid, the defending champions, beat Juventus 4\u20131 to win a record-extending 12th title. With this victory, Real Madrid became the first team to successfully defend their title in the Champions League era, and the first to successfully defend a European Cup since Milan in 1990.\nAs winners, Real Madrid qualified as the UEFA representative for the 2017 FIFA Club World Cup in the United Arab Emirates, and also earned the right to play against the winners of the 2016\u201317 UEFA Europa League, Manchester United, in the 2017 UEFA Super Cup, ultimately triumphing in both competitions.\n\n\n== Association team allocation ==\nA total of 78 teams from 53 of the 55 UEFA member associations were expected to participate in the 2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League (the exceptions being Liechtenstein, which did not organise a domestic league, and Kosovo, whose participation was not accepted in their first attempt as UEFA members).

Because a maximum of five teams from one association can enter the Champions League, if both the Champions League title holders and the Europa League title holders were from the same top three ranked association and finish outside the top four of their domestic league, the fourth-placed team of their association would be moved to the Europa League. For this season:\nThe winners of the 2015\u201316 UEFA Champions League, Real Madrid, qualified through their domestic league, meaning the additional entry for the Champions League title holders was not necessary.\nThe winners of the 2015\u201316 UEFA Europa League, Sevilla, did not qualify through their domestic league, meaning the additional entry for the Europa League title holders was necessary.\n\n\n=== Association ranking ===\nFor the 2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League, the associations were allocated places according to their 2015 UEFA country coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2010\u201311 to 2014\u201315.\nApart from the allocation based on the country coefficients, associations could have additional teams participating in the Champions League, as noted below:\n\n(EL) \u2013 Additional berth for Europa League title holders\n\nNotes\n\n\n=== Distribution ===\nIn the default access list, the Champions League title holders enter the group stage.

It came just two years after Wembley hosted the final in 2011, making it the seventh occasion Wembley Stadium (current and old) had hosted the Champions League final. Bayern Munich, who had been runners-up in the previous season, beat Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund 2\u20131 to win their fifth title in the competition. It was the first all-German final and the fourth final to feature two teams from the same association, after the finals of 2000, 2003 and 2008.\nThe defending champions, Chelsea, were eliminated in the group stage, becoming the first title holders to leave the competition at this stage. They went on to win the 2013 UEFA Europa League final, and became the first team to win the Europa League as the holders of the Champions League.\n\n\n== Association team allocation ==\nA total of 76 teams from 52 of the 53 UEFA member associations participate in the 2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League (the exception being Liechtenstein, which do not organise a domestic league).

The competition was won by Real Madrid, who clinched a historic eighth title win by beating fellow La Liga side, Valencia in the final. The final was hosted in the Stade de France in Paris, the city where the original roots of the competition had begun nearly 50 years earlier.\nJust after two years of allowing runners-up of strongest continental leagues to enter the tournament, UEFA went even further and expanded the tournament to up to four strongest teams from Europe's top national leagues. As a result, the tournament was a stark contrast from 1996\u201397 (which took place only three years prior) where only top national champions and title holders participated.\nThe competition was dominated by the Spanish teams, with three of the four semi-finalists coming from Spain, namely Real Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona. The final between Real Madrid and Valencia marked the first time that both finalists in the competition had come from the same country.\nManchester United were the defending champions, but were eliminated by eventual winners Real Madrid in the quarter-finals.\n\n\n== Changes to the competition format ==\nThe 1999\u20132000 edition of the Champions League featured a whole different format to the competition. An additional qualifying round was introduced to generate two group stages, firstly with 32 teams \u2013 eight groups of four \u2013 who played six matches each to reduce the competition to 16 teams for the second group stage, with the eight third-placed teams moving to the UEFA Cup third round. At the end of the second group stage, eight teams remained to contest the knock-out stage.\n\n\n== Association team allocation ==\nA total of 71 teams participated in the 1999\u20132000 Champions League, from 47 of 51 UEFA associations. Liechtenstein (who don't have their own league) as well as Andorra and San Marino did not participate.

The coefficients were calculated on the basis of a combination of 20% of the value of the respective national association's coefficient for the period from 2005\u201306 to 2009\u201310 inclusive and the clubs' individual performances in the UEFA club competitions during the same period. Clubs were ordered by their coefficients and then divided into pots as required.\nIn the draws for the qualifying rounds and the play-off round, the teams were divided evenly into one seeded and one unseeded pot, based on their club coefficients. A seeded team was drawn against an unseeded team, with the order of legs in each tie also being decided randomly. Due to the limited time between matches, the draws for the second and third qualifying rounds took place before the results of the previous round were known. The seeding in each draw was carried out under the assumption that all of the highest-ranked clubs of the previous round were victorious. If a lower-ranked club was victorious, it simply took the place of its defeated opponent in the next round. Moreover, in the third qualifying round and play-off round, champion clubs and non-champion clubs were kept separated. Prior to these draws, UEFA could form \"groups\" in accordance with the principles set by the Club Competitions Committee, but they were purely for convenience of the draw and did not resemble any real groupings in the sense of the competition, while ensuring that teams from the same association were not drawn against each other.\nIn the draw for the group stage, the 32 teams were split into four pots of eight teams, based on their club coefficients, with the title holder automatically placed into Pot 1. Each group contained one team from each pot, but teams from the same association could not be drawn into the same group.
