{"page_content": "The Chevrolet Monte Carlo is a two-door coupe that was manufactured and marketed by the Chevrolet division of General Motors. Deriving its name from the city in Monaco, the Monte Carlo was marketed as the first personal luxury car of the Chevrolet brand. Introduced for the 1970 model year, the model line was produced across six generations through the 2007 model year, with a hiatus from 1989 until 1994. The Monte Carlo was a variant of the Pontiac Grand Prix throughout its production.\nFrom 1970 until 1972, the Monte Carlo rode on the unique \"A-Special\" platform with the Grand Prix, shifting to the standard A-body intermediate chassis from the 1973 through 1977 model years. For 1978, the Monte Carlo line underwent downsizing, but was still considered a midsized coupe. The rear-wheel drive A-body platform of this generation of Monte Carlo was redesignated as the G-body when GM's front-wheel drive A-body cars were introduced for the 1982 model year. After an abbreviated 1988 model year, the Monte Carlo was replaced by the two-door Chevrolet Lumina.\nFor the 1995 model year, the Monte Carlo was revived, replacing the two-door Lumina. It shared the front-wheel drive W-platform with the two-door Grand Prix, and was the largest coupe in the Chevrolet lineup. After the 2002 model year, the Grand Prix coupe was discontinued, the Monte Carlo became the largest two-door model produced by an American auto manufacturer.\nIn response to declining sales of the model line, Chevrolet discontinued the Monte Carlo after the 2008 model year. During much of its production, the Monte Carlo represented the Chevrolet brand in stock car racing. During the 1980s, the Monte Carlo SS was introduced, featuring aerodynamically-enhanced styling; as part of its revival, the Monte Carlo again represented Chevrolet in stock car racing from 1995 through its discontinuation.\n\n\n== Development ==\nFor the 1968 model year, GM instituted a split-wheelbase policy for its A-platform intermediate-sized cars. Two-door models would have a 112 in (2,845 mm) wheelbase, 116 in (2,946 mm) for sedans, and 121 in (3,073 mm) for station wagons. In 1969, GM introduced the Pontiac Grand Prix, a two-door that used the A-platform layout that was stretched ahead of the firewall to make it 210.2-inch (5,339 mm) long. This gave the design an unusually long hood design, helping the new Grand Prix to outsell its larger B-body predecessor despite higher prices. The new layout was first known as the A-body Special, but would evolve into its own class known as the G-platform.\nThe Monte Carlo began as Chevrolet's version of the Pontiac Grand Prix, as conceived by Elliot M. (Pete) Estes, general manager of Chevrolet, and Chevrolet's chief stylist, David Holls, giving Chevrolet and Pontiac an alternative to the E-body Buick Riviera and Oldsmobile Toronado. They modeled the styling on the contemporary Cadillac Eldorado. However, much of the body and structure were shared with the Chevrolet Chevelle (firewall, windshield, decklid, and rear window were the same). New exterior \"coke bottle styling\" featured concealed windshield wipers. A fiber-optic exterior light monitoring system was optional.\nA mid-1990s article in the magazine Chevrolet High Performance stated that the first generation Monte Carlo was known to Chevrolet management under the working name Concours. The usual practice at the time was that all Chevrolet model development names started with a \"C\". At one point, the proposal called for a formal coupe, sedan, and convertible. It has been noted that the sedan resembled a full-size Oldsmobile 98 before the use of the GM G platform, with at least one photograph showing the pull-up door handles that would be introduced on the 1970 Camaro and then on 1971 Vegas and full-sized Chevys. Monte Carlos received this design on the 1973 second-generation model. The 1970 Monte Carlo was available only as a two-door hardtop.\nThe Monte Carlo was developed at Chevrolet under the leadership of Pete Este\nThe Chevrolet Lumina is a mid-size car that was produced and marketed by the Chevrolet division of General Motors from 1989 until 2001.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe first generation of the Lumina replaced the Chevrolet Celebrity and Chevrolet Monte Carlo under a single nameplate; the mechanically unrelated Chevrolet Lumina APV minivan served as the successor for the Celebrity station wagon. The model line was based on the front-wheel-drive GM10 platform (later designated the GM W platform), shared with Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac. For 1995, the second-generation Lumina was introduced, serving as a substantial exterior revision of the previous generation (the two-door coupe was renamed the Monte Carlo). For the 2000 model year, the Lumina was replaced by the Chevrolet Impala; the model line would retain the W platform through the 2016 model year.\nThroughout its production, both generations of the Lumina were produced by General Motors Canada at Oshawa Car Assembly (Oshawa, Ontario). For markets outside of North America, the Chevrolet Lumina was derived from other large GM sedans. From 1998 to 2013, the Lumina was marketed in the Middle East and South Africa as a Chevrolet-badged version of the Holden Commodore produced in Australia. From 2005 to 2006, GM Philippines sold the Lumina as a Chevrolet-badged version of the Buick Regal (sharing much of its body with its American counterpart).\n\n\n== First generation (1990) ==\n\nThe North American Chevrolet Lumina was based on the mid-size GM10 platform, which was shared with the Pontiac Grand Prix, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, and Buick Regal. Although the Lumina became a popular seller, GM was widely criticized in the motoring press for being late to the game in introducing a direct aero-designed competitor to the Ford Taurus. The \"Lumina\" name was considered by Ford in the pre-production stage of the Taurus. Both body styles were available in base and sporty Euro trim, which was a successor to the Celebrity Eurosport.\n\nAirbags were not yet available at the time of introduction so seat belts were installed in the front doors as \"passive restraints\". These belts were connected to the upper and lower portions of the front doors, and could remain latched while allowing front passengers the ability to enter and exit the vehicle without removing them. This technically satisfied US Government regulations concerning passive occupant safety requirements. GM was heavily criticized for the lack of airbags in Lumina, by 1993 the Ford Taurus, Honda Accord and Toyota Camry all came equipped with at least one front airbag.\nThe coupe and sedan were installed with MacPherson front struts, while the rear suspension used Chapman struts and a transverse-mounted fiberglass leaf spring, borrowing an approach used from the Chevrolet Corvette (C4) rear suspension.\nThe Chevrolet Lumina's first generation ended production in August 1994, making this the shortest-produced generation of the first-generation GM10 cars.\n\n\n=== NASCAR ===\nIn 1989, the Lumina became the nameplate under which Chevrolets were raced in NASCAR, more than a year before the model was available to the public. As a result, NASCAR received many letters complaining about the unfair advantage of Chevrolet racing an \"aluminum\" car.\n\n\n=== Lumina Z34 ===\n\nStarting in 1990, Chevrolet offered a high-performance version of the Lumina, the Lumina Z34. It came standard with the FE3 sport suspension package, the 210 hp (157 kW; 213 PS) LQ1 V6 engine shared with the Lumina Euro 3.4 (sedan), the 5-speed Getrag 284 manual transmission, dual exhaust, and 4-wheel anti-lock brakes. \nThe Z34 also featured cosmetic changes to go along with the performance enhancements such as unique front and rear fascias, side skirts, a rear spoiler, a louvered hood, a unique steering wheel, and sport bucket seats, and an optional Bose stereo system. \nPerformance figures included a 0-60 mph (0\u201397 km/h) time of 7.1 seconds, a 1/4 mile (~400 m) time of 15.5 seconds, a (limited) top \nMonte Carlo ( MON-tee KAR-loh, Italian: [\u02c8monte \u02c8karlo]; French: Monte-Carlo, French: [m\u0254\u0303te ka\u0281lo]; or colloquially Monte-Carl, French: [m\u0254\u0303te ka\u0281l]; Mon\u00e9gasque: Munte Carlu, Ligurian: [\u02c8mu\u014bte \u02c8ka\u027elu]; lit.\u2009'Mount Charles') is an official administrative area of Monaco, specifically the ward of Monte Carlo/Sp\u00e9lugues, where the Monte Carlo Casino is located. Informally, the name also refers to a larger district, the Monte Carlo Quarter (corresponding to the former municipality of Monte Carlo), which besides Monte Carlo/Sp\u00e9lugues also includes the wards of La Rousse/Saint Roman, Larvotto/Bas Moulins and Saint Michel. The permanent population of the ward of Monte Carlo is about 3,500, while that of the quarter is about 15,000. Monaco has four traditional quarters. From west to east they are: Fontvieille (the newest), Monaco-Ville (the oldest), La Condamine, and Monte Carlo.\nMonte Carlo is situated on a prominent escarpment at the base of the Maritime Alps along the French Riviera. Near the quarter's western end is the \"world-famous Place du Casino, the gambling center ... that has made Monte Carlo an international byword for the extravagant display and reckless dispersal of wealth\". It is also the location of the H\u00f4tel de Paris, Caf\u00e9 de Paris and Salle Garnier (the casino theatre which is the home of the Op\u00e9ra de Monte-Carlo). The quarter's eastern part includes the community of Larvotto with Monaco's only public beach, as well as its new convention center (the Grimaldi Forum), and the Monte-Carlo Bay Hotel & Resort. At the quarter's eastern border, one crosses into the French town of Beausoleil (sometimes referred to as Monte-Carlo-Sup\u00e9rieur), and 8 kilometres (5 mi) to its east is the western border of Italy.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1856, Charles III of Monaco granted a concession to Napoleon Langlois and Albert Aubert, to establish a sea-bathing facility for the treatment of various diseases, and to build a German-style casino.\n\nThe initial casino opened in La Condamine in 1862, but was unsuccessful.  It relocated several times, before reaching its present location in the \"Les Sp\u00e9lugues\" (The Caves) area of Monte Carlo.  Success came slowly, largely because Monaco was inaccessible from much of Europe. The railway, installed in 1868, brought with it an influx of people, and Monte Carlo grew in wealth.\nSaint-Charles Church on Monte Carlo's Avenue Sainte-Charles was completed in 1883. It was restored in its centenary year.\nThe municipality of Monte Carlo was created in 1911, when the constitution divided the principality of Monaco into three municipalities. Monte Carlo encompassed the existing neighborhoods of La Rousse/Saint Roman, Larvotto/Bas Moulins, and Saint Michel. The municipalities merged in 1917, after accusations that the government used them to \"divide and conquer\".  Since then, they became wards. Today, Monaco is divided into 9 wards, which are grouped into 4 quartiers.\nThe quarter of Monte Carlo was served by tramways from 1898 to 1931. It linked all parts of Monaco (see transportation in Monaco). In 2003 a new cruise ship pier was completed in the harbour at Monte Carlo.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMonte Carlo has an area of 28.14 hectares (or 0.28 square kilometers) and faces the Mediterranean Sea, bordered to the west by Ravin de Sainte-D\u00e9vote and La Condamine, and to the east by La Rousse and Larvotto.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMonte Carlo has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa), which is influenced by oceanic climate and humid subtropical climate. As a result, it has warm, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. \n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nMonte Carlo is home to an ATP Masters 1000 tennis tournament during the clay court season usually played during the end of March through mid to late April. Monte Carlo is a popular tax haven for many tennis professionals and home to many active and retired athletes. \nMonte Carlo is host to most of the Circuit de Monaco, on which the Formula One Monaco Grand Prix takes place. I\nThe W-platform (also known as the W-body) was a General Motors automotive platform  underpinning both mid size and full-size front-wheel drive cars \u2014 across the platform's three generations from 1987-2016. \nCode named GM10, the program began development in 1982 under Chairman Roger B. Smith and debuted in 1987 with the Pontiac Grand Prix, Buick Regal, and Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme coup\u00e9s \u2014 with the four-door sedan body style introduced for 1990.\nThe 1997\u20132005 2nd Generation, or W2 Platform, used both a 110.5 in full-size wheelbase as well as a 109 in mid-size wheelbase.\nFrom 2005-2016, the W3 Platform used a 110.5 in, full-size wheelbase in sedan and coupe configurations, including for the Pontiac Grand Prix (2004-2008), Buick LaCrosse/Allure (2005-2009), Chevrolet Impala/Impala Limited (2005-2016) and Chevrolet Monte Carlo (2000-2007) \u2014 each with high performance V8 variants.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe platform cost $7 billion to develop, with engineering executed by the Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canada (CPC) group; also known as the small car division. The original program was intended to replace all midsize cars produced by Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Buick on the G and A platforms.  This ultimately did not happen; while the A-platform Chevrolet Celebrity and Pontiac 6000 were quickly discontinued, the A-body Buick Century and Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera remained in production until 1996. \nThe plan was for seven GM plants that would each assemble 250,000 of the cars, or 21% of the total U.S. car market. It was badly executed from the start, but GM's 1984 reorganization, combined with changing market dynamics, wrought havoc with the program and it never recovered. In 2008, prominent shareholder activist Robert A. G. Monks noted that GM had lost $2000 on every car it produced in 1989, the year before the last of the original GM10's were launched.\n\nThe next iteration of the platform was known as the MS2000 or simply the W2 platform. Early versions used a transversely installed, fiberglass mono-leaf spring combined with struts in the rear. The \"generation 1.5\" W-body models had updated rear suspensions that used coil springs instead of the transverse leaf spring design inspired by the Chevrolet Corvette. For the 1997 model year the second generation W-body was released with a MacPherson strut coil spring design.\nA revised and updated W3 platform was introduced in 2004, rather than a stretched Epsilon platform, as had been planned. Parma Metal Fabricating Division of Parma, Ohio was responsible for metal fabrication and final assembly took place at GM's Oshawa Car Assembly. The transverse use of GM's LS small-block engine in the W-bodies was a major addition for 2005.\nThe GM W Platform was phased out with the production of the new long-wheelbase Epsilon II platform. The last car produced on the W platform was the ninth generation of the Chevrolet Impala, which was replaced by the Epsilon-based tenth-generation Impala, beginning in model year 2014. GM continued to produce the W-body Impala to fleet customers only under the name Impala Limited until production ended in May 2016.\n\n\n== Applications ==\nVehicles using the W-body platform include:\n\n1st Gen 107.5 in wheelbase (mid-size)\n1988\u20131996 Buick Regal (2-door coupe, 4-door sedan)\n1988\u20131997 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme (2-door coupe, 2-door convertible, 4-door sedan)\n1988\u20131996 Pontiac Grand Prix (2-door coupe, 4-door sedan)\n1990\u20131994 Chevrolet Lumina (2-door coupe, 4-door sedan)\n1.5 Gen 107.5 in wheelbase (mid-size)\n1995\u20132001 Chevrolet Lumina (4-door sedan)\n1995\u20131999 Chevrolet Monte Carlo (2-door coupe)\n2nd Gen 109 in wheelbase (mid-size)\n1997\u20132005 Buick Century (4-door sedan)\n1997\u20132004 Buick Regal (4-door sedan)\n1998\u20132002 Oldsmobile Intrigue (4-door sedan)\n2nd Gen 110.5 in wheelbase (full-size)\n1997\u20132003 Pontiac Grand Prix (2-door coupe, 4-door sedan)\n2000\u20132005 Chevrolet Impala (4-door sedan)\n2000\u20132005 Chevrolet Monte Carlo (2-door coupe)\n3rd gen 110.5 in wheelbase (full-size)\n2004\u20132008 Pon\nThe Generation 4 car was the NASCAR vehicle generation used from 1992 to 2007 full-time in the NASCAR Cup Series, in the Busch/Nationwide Series until 2010, and in the ARCA Racing Series until 2017.  The generation has been described as the generation that removed all \"stock\" aspects from stock car racing and was as aerodynamically sensitive as a Le Mans Prototype.\nGeneration 4 cars feature highly modified bodies with teams spending hours in the wind tunnel to gain aerodynamics.  The bumpers, nose and tail are composed of molded fiberglass based on production counterparts. In the 2000s teams began using different RPM levels on their engines making each team and manufacturer sound different.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1992, the Gen 4 car arrived at the sport when steel bodies became primarily custom made instead of using stock pieces, and wind tunnels became a staple as teams worked to gain aerodynamics. At racing speeds approaching 200 miles per hour, a modern NASCAR race car can generate enough lift to get airborne if it spins sideways. To keep cars firmly planted, roof flaps were required in 1994.\n1994 was also the final year that V6 engines were used in the Busch Series, as many short track series had abandoned six-cylinder engines.\nIn 1995, Chevrolet switched back to the Monte Carlo, which started the trend of rounder body shapes in Cup as a body facelift and the then-Busch Series. In 1998, Ford introduced the Taurus, which was the first four-door stock car model approved for NASCAR competition in the modern era.\nIn 2001, Dodge made its return to NASCAR with the Intrepid. That same year, Dale Earnhardt died from a crash at the Daytona 500, leading NASCAR to make serious safety changes. In 2003, in response to the asymmetrical body of the Taurus in the previous seasons, NASCAR set up new body rules, better known as the \"common body templates\" rule; as a result, the hood, roof, and decklid were no longer required to be identical to their stock counterparts. In 2004, the sport switched from Unocal 76 fuel to Sunoco.\nThe Gen 4 car was used full time until 2007, and it was retired in the Cup Series after the 2007 season (in which Toyota, who had already competed in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series, made their debut in the Cup and the then-Busch Series with the Camry), while the other sixteen races were run by the fifth-generation Car of Tomorrow. The Car of Tomorrow went full-time in 2008, with the second-tier series adopting their own Car of Tomorrow first part-time in 2010 and full-time the following year. Body panels in the style of the Gen 4 car continue to be manufactured by Five Star Race Car Bodies, and were legal in the ARCA Racing Series until 2020, when composite-bodied cars in the style of the Generation 6 were mandated (despite this, modern ARCA cars still use Gen 4 chassis). As of 2022, the Gen 4 car is still legal in the ARCA Menards Series West and East (though Dodge body panels are illegal); Hailie Deegan scored her first NASCAR win at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway dirt track in a Gen 4 Toyota Camry in 2019.\nIn the generation's final years, aerodynamic development led to some of the cars (otherwise known as \"offset\" bodies) being called \"twisted sisters\" in reference to the asymmetrical shapes of the car's body. The Car of Tomorrow, by contrast, featured a symmetrical body in order to curb aerodynamic development wars in an attempt to cut costs.\n\n\n== Models ==\n\n\n=== Chrysler ===\nDodge Intrepid (2001\u20132004, no model branding in 2004)\nDodge Charger (2005\u20132007, use continued until 2010 in Nationwide Series)\n\n\n=== Ford ===\nFord Thunderbird (1992\u20131999, limited superspeedway use after 1997)\nFord Taurus (1998\u20132005)\nFord Fusion (2006\u20132007, use continued until 2010 in Nationwide Series)\n\n\n=== General Motors ===\nChevrolet Lumina (1992\u20131994)\nChevrolet Monte Carlo (1995\u20132005)\nChevrolet Monte Carlo SS (2006\u20132007, use continued until 2008 in Nationwide Series)\nChevrolet Impala (2009\u20132010, Nationwide Series only)\nPontiac Grand Prix (19\nThe General Motors G platform (also called G-body) was an automobile platform designation used for mid-sized rear-wheel drive cars. It made its first appearance from the 1969 to 1972 model years, adapted from GM's A-body, and reappeared from 1982 to 1988. The second series of G-bodies began production designated as A-body cars in 1978, but were redesignated as G-body when the new front-wheel drive A-body platform was introduced in 1982.\n\n\n== Use ==\nThe G-body designation was originally used for the 1969\u20131972 Pontiac Grand Prix and 1970\u20131972 Chevrolet Monte Carlo personal luxury cars, which rode on longer wheelbases than A-body coupes.\nFor 1973, the Grand Prix and Monte Carlo were related to the A-body line, with all formal-roof A-body coupes designated as A-Special (and, after 1982, G-Special). These special coupes included the Monte Carlo, Grand Prix, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, and Buick Regal.\nFor the 1982 model year, GM introduced a new front-wheel drive A platform for its mid-size car lines. The rear-wheel drive platform that had been in use since 1978 was re-designated as the G platform, and select models remained in production. The Chevrolet Malibu and Pontiac LeMans coupes were dropped; on sedans and wagons the LeMans nameplate continued only in Canada while the formerly full-size Bonneville replaced it in the U.S. 1983 was the last year for the Malibu sedan and all station wagons, leaving the G-Special coupes; Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac formal-roof sedans; and the Chevrolet El Camino/GMC Caballero. For 1988, most remaining G-body models were moved to the new front-wheel drive W platform. The Pontiac Bonneville had been moved to the H platform for 1987, the El Camino was dropped without a replacement, and there would be a one-year gap before the W-body Chevrolet Lumina coupe replaced the Monte Carlo. GM later used the G-body designation for unrelated full-sized front-wheel drive cars.\nThe G-bodies were some of the last cars to follow the front-engine, large V8 and rear-wheel drive muscle car formula, remaining popular while most mid-sized cars moved to front-wheel drive. They were also among the last production-based vehicles raced in NASCAR (and competitively, with the Buick Regal in particular dominating many races in its time). NASCAR regulations continued to stipulate production body parts until 2003 (namely, the hood, roof, and deck lid), but since most of the vehicles that bodies were derived from during this period had a transverse front-wheel drive layout (many even lacking a V8 as an option), the drivetrain and all running gear were either custom-built or sourced from other (usually, older) models.\n\n\n== Vehicles ==\n\nThis family consisted of:\n\nBuick Regal (1982\u20131987)\nChevrolet El Camino (1982\u20131987)\nChevrolet Malibu (1982\u20131983)\nChevrolet Monte Carlo (1982\u20131988)\nGMC Caballero (1982\u20131987)\nOldsmobile Cutlass Supreme (1982\u20131987)\nOldsmobile Cutlass Supreme Classic (1988)\nOldsmobile Cutlass Cruiser (1982\u20131983)\nPontiac Grand LeMans (1982\u20131983) (Canada only)\nPontiac Bonneville (1982\u20131986)\nPontiac Grand Prix (1982\u20131987)\n\n\n== Performance variants ==\nPerformance applications included:\n\n1982 Buick Regal Sport Coupe 3.8 L (231 in3) V6 Turbo\n1982, 1984\u20131987 Buick Grand National 3.8 L (231 in3) V6 Turbo\n1983\u20131986 Buick Regal T-Type 3.8 L (231 in3) V6 Turbo\n1982\u20131987 Chevrolet El Camino SS 5.0 L (305 in3)\n1985\u20131987 Oldsmobile 442 5.0 L (307 in3) HO V8\n1983\u20131984 Oldsmobile Hurst/Olds 5.0 L (307 in3) HO V8\n1983\u20131988 Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS 5.0 L (305 in3) HO V8\n1986\u20131987 Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS Aerocoupe 5.0 L (305 in3) HO V8\n1986.5 Pontiac Grand Prix 2+2 5.0 L (305 in3) V8\nThe 1986.5 Grand Prix 2+2 had cosmetic changes which included a NASCAR-qualifying nose cone (also available through GM for installation on any 1981\u20131987 Grand Prix).

Designed for transverse engine configurations, the series includes 4 forward gears. The 4Txx family is an evolution of the original Turbo-Hydramatic 125 transverse automatic introduced in the late 1970s and the Turbo-Hydramatic 440 transmission developed in the mid-1980s.\nThe \"-E\" transmission is electronically controlled and features an automatic overdrive transaxle with an electronically controlled torque converter clutch.\nThe 4T65 is built at Warren Transmission in Warren, Michigan.\n\n\n== 4T60-E ==\n\nFor 1991 GM introduced the 4T60-E which was a 4T60 with electronic controls, first seen on the new Buick Park Avenue. One benefit was that the cruise control was integrated into the gearbox' electronic control module, improving the ability to maintain a set speed while avoiding needless shifting, thus lowering fuel consumption and noise levels. By the mid-1990s, the 4T60-E was the transmission of choice in nearly every front-wheel drive GM vehicle with the exception of compacts. A heavy-duty 4T60-E HD was produced in 1996 for the supercharged GM 3800 engine and reused in mid 2005 to 2009 with an LS4 5.3 liter V8 in four different models the Buick Lacrosse Super, Chevrolet Impala SS, Chevrolet Monte Carlo  SS, and Pontiac Grand Prix GXP. The 4T60-E was phased out in favor of the 4T65 beginning in 1997.\nThe 4T60-E featured a 245 mm (9.6 in) torque converter with varying stall speed and gear ratios. For example, a 1995 Beretta features a 1650 rpm stall converter as opposed to a 1999 Century converter with a stall of 2095 rpm. In the 4T60 family of transmissions, the combination of drive-chain sprocket ratios and the differential gear ratio together offer up to 12 different possible final drive ratios to allow the transmission family to cover various engine and vehicle applications.\nReplacing a complete transaxle should only be done if a unit is verified to be the same as the unit it replaces, as in addition to the up to 12 variants of the final drive ratio, different applications and years can and will have incompatible electrical connectors. The use of an incorrect transaxle will result in undesired operation, up to and including total non-functioning of the transaxle.\nGear ratios:\n\nApplications: \n\n4T60-E\n1994-1999 Buick Century\n1992-1997 Buick LeSabre 3800 V6, L27\n1991-1996 Buick Park Avenue V6 3.8 L\n1991      Buick Reatta 3800 V6\n1993-1997 Buick Regal\n1991-1993 Buick Riviera 3800 V6\n1995-1996 Buick Riviera L67 & L36\n1994-1998 Buick Skylark\n1991-1993 Cadillac DeVille 4.9L V8\n1991-1992 Cadillac Fleetwood\n1991-1993 Cadillac Seville\n1991-1993 Cadillac Sixty Special\n1994\u20131996 Chevrolet Beretta/Corsica V6 3.1 L\n1992\u20131996 Chevrolet Lumina APV V6 3.4 L/3.8 L\n1993\u20132000 Chevrolet Lumina\n1995-1999 Chevrolet Monte Carlo\n1997-1998 Chevrolet Venture\n1994-1998 Oldsmobile Achieva\n1994-1996 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera/Oldsmobile Ciera V6 3100 L\n1993-1997 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme\n1992-1997 Oldsmobile 88\n1991-1996 Oldsmobile 98\n1992\u20131998 Oldsmobile Silhouette V6 3.4 L/3.8 L\n1991-1992 Oldsmobile Toronado/Trofeo 3800 V6\n1992-1997 Pontiac Bonneville\n1994-1998 Pontiac Grand Am V6 3.1 L\n1992-1996 Pontiac Grand Prix \"GT\" & GTP 3.4L V6 (LQ1 Motor)\n1992\u20131998 Pontiac Trans Sport V6 3.4 L/3.8 L\n4T60-E HD\n1991-1996 Buick Park Avenue\n1992-1996 Oldsmobile 88\n1992-1996 Oldsmobile 98\n1992-1996 Pontiac Bonneville\n1997 Pontiac Grand Prix \"GT\" 3800 V6 (L36 Motor)\n1995-1996 Buick Riviera\n\n\n== 4T65-E ==\nThe 4T65-E was introduced to replace the 4T60-E in 1997.

The engine was originally 198 cu in (3.2 L) and was marketed as the Fireball engine. GM continued to develop and refine the 231 cu in (3.8 L) V6, eventually and commonly referred to simply as the 3800, through numerous iterations.\nThe 3800 made the Ward's 10 Best Engines of the 20th Century list and made Ward's yearly 10 Best list numerous times. It is one of the most-manufactured engines in automotive history, with over 25 million produced.\nThe engine originally derived from Buick's 215 cu in (3.5 L) aluminium V8 family, which also went on to become the Rover V8, manufactured from 1960\u20132006.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe 3800's block is cast iron and all variants use iron, two-valve-per-cylinder OHV heads. The engine, originally designed and manufactured in the United States, was also produced in later versions in Australia. It was the first six-cylinder engine designed exclusively for Buick products since the Buick straight-six was discontinued in 1930.\nIn 1967, GM sold the design to Kaiser-Jeep since they no longer felt the need to produce a V6, considered an unusual engine configuration in North America at the time. The 1973 oil crisis prompted the company to re-acquire the design from American Motors (AMC), who had purchased Kaiser-Jeep in 1970, in early 1974. The descendants of the early 231 continue as the most-common GM V6, as it developed into a very durable and reliable design.\nThough the pre-3800 rear-wheel drive (RWD) V6 uses the Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac (BOP) bellhousing pattern, an oddity of both the front-wheel drive (FWD) and RWD 3800 V6 is that although it is a 90\u00b0 V6, it uses the GM 60\u00b0 V6 bell housing (Metric Pattern). For use in the FWD applications, the bellhousings on the FWD transmissions are altered slightly.\nThis engine has the cylinders numbered 1-3-5 on the left-hand bank (front bank for FWD applications) and 2-4-6 on the right-hand bank, the number 1 cylinder being the furthest from the flywheel end. The firing order is 1-6-5-4-3-2.\nThe engine was produced at the Flint North plant in Flint, Michigan, with engine blocks and cylinder heads cast at the Grey Iron plant (now the GM Saginaw Metal Casting Operations plant) at 1629 N. Washington Avenue in Saginaw, Michigan.\n\n\n== Versions ==\n\n\n=== Fireball V6 ===\nThe first engine in this family, RPO code 6I, was introduced in 1961 for the 1962 model year Buick Special with Buick's 198 cu in (3.2 L) engine, the first V6 in an American car (the GMC V6 was used earlier in trucks). Because it was derived from Buick's 215 cu in (3.5 L) aluminum V8, it has a 90\u00b0 bank between cylinders and an uneven firing pattern due to the crankshaft having only three crank pins set at 120\u00b0 apart, with opposing cylinders (1-2, 3-4, and 5-6) sharing a crank pin in, as do many V8 engines. The uneven firing pattern was often perceived as roughness, leading a former American Motors executive to describe it as \"rougher than a cob.\"\nThe off-center design continued up until the 1988 LN3 version of the engine, when the left-hand bank of cylinders was moved forward relative to the right-hand bank. Although the actual bore spacing between cylinders on the same bank remained unchanged at 4.24 in (108 mm), the LN3 and later engines became known to have \"on-center bore spacing\".\n\n\n==== 198 ====\nThe Buick Division, concerned about high manufacturing costs of their innovative aluminum 215 V8, sought to develop a cheaper, cast-iron engine based on the same tooling. It was given the RPO code JL. They settled on an unusual 90\u00b0 V6 layout that was essentially the architecture of the '215' less two cylinders. In initial form, it had a bore and stroke of 3.625 in \u00d7 3.1875 in (92.08 mm \u00d7 80.96 mm), for an overall displacement of 198 cu in (3.2 L). It weighed about 35 lb (16 kg) more than the aluminum engine, but was far cheaper to produce. Dubbed the Fireball V6, it became the standard engine in th\nSuper Sport, or SS, is the signature performance option package offered by the Chevrolet division of General Motors on a limited number of its vehicles. All SS models come with distinctive \"SS\" markings on their exterior. The SS package was first made available for the 1961 Impala. Some of the other models bearing the SS badge include the Camaro, Chevelle, El Camino, Impala, Monte Carlo, Nova and Chevrolet Pickup Trucks. Current SS models are produced by the GM Performance Division.\nGeneral Motors's also offered SS models through its Australian subsidiary Holden in its range of Holden Commodore sedans and sportwagons, and also in the Holden Ute range of two-door coup\u00e9 utilities.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn December 1956, Chevrolet unveiled a show car based on the first generation (C1) Corvette called the Corvette Super Sport. In early 1957, the Chevrolet Corvette SS debuted \u2014 a custom built racing sports car that was the first Chevrolet to wear the SS badge.\nIn 1961, the SS \"kit\" (known as a sport and appearance package) was offered on any Impala for just $53.80. The package included Super Sport trim for both the interior and exterior, chassis reinforcements, stronger springs and shocks, power brakes, spinner wheel covers, and narrow-band whitewall tires. The car's dashboard received a Corvette style passenger hand bar and a steering column mounted 7000-rpm tachometer.  Chevrolet built 491,000 Impalas that year and 453 had the SS package, of which 311 received the 348 cid and 142 received the 409 cid. Since 1994, the SS package has been used on a variety of GM vehicles, including pickup trucks, four-door sedans, and front wheel drive cars.\nBoth historically and today, the Super Sport package has typically included high-performance tires, heavy-duty suspension, and increased power, along with a variety of other performance and appearance upgrades.\n\n\n== SS models ==\n\n\n=== Current SS models ===\nChevrolet Blazer EV: A 557 hp (415 kW) EV using the Ultium battery pack.\n\n\n=== Previous SS models ===\n\n\n==== Cars ====\n\nChevrolet (Commodore) SS: 6.2 L (380 cu in) LS3 V8 producing 415 hp (309 kW) 2014-2017\nChevrolet Cobalt: 2.0 L (120 cu in) turbocharged Ecotec LNF I4 producing 260 hp (194 kW) 2008\u20132010 (4 door, 2009)\nChevrolet Cobalt: 2.0 L (120 cu in) supercharged Ecotec LSJ I4 producing 205 hp (153 kW) 2005\u20132007\nChevrolet Cobalt: 2.4 L (150 cu in) Ecotec LE5 I4 producing 171 hp (128 kW) 2006\u20132008\nChevrolet HHR: 2.0 L (120 cu in) turbocharged Ecotec LNF I4 producing 260 hp (194 kW) 2008\u20132010\nChevrolet Impala 1961\u20131969, 1994\u20131996, 2004\u20132009\nChevrolet Malibu/Malibu Maxx 2006\u20132007\nChevrolet Chevelle 1964\u20131973\nChevrolet Camaro 1967\u20131972, 1996\u20132002, 2010\u20132024\nChevrolet El Camino 1968\u20131987\nChevrolet Chevy II Nova 1963\u20131968\nChevrolet Nova 1969\u20131976\nChevrolet Monte Carlo 1970\u20131971, 1983\u20131988, 2000\u20132007\n\n\n==== Trucks ====\n\nChevrolet 454 SS 1990\u20131993\nChevrolet S10 SS 1994\u20131998\nChevrolet SSR: 6.0 L (370 cu in) LS2 V8\nChevrolet Silverado SS\nChevrolet Silverado Intimidator SS\nChevrolet TrailBlazer SS: 6.0 L (370 cu in) LS2 V8 2006\u20132009\n\n\n=== Middle Eastern market ===\nChevrolet Caprice: rebadge of Impala SS (performance version of 4th generation Chevrolet Caprice sedan), 5.7 L (350 cu in) LT1 V8 producing 260 hp (264 PS; 194 kW) 1995\u20131996\nChevrolet Caprice: rebadge of Holden Caprice, 5.7 L (350 cu in) LS1 V8 producing 350 hp (355 PS; 261 kW) 1999\u20132006, 6.0 L (370 cu in) L98 V8 producing 360 hp (365 PS; 268 kW) 2006\u20132009, 6.0 L (370 cu in) L77 V8 producing 350 hp (355 PS; 261 kW) 2009\u20132015, 6.2 L (380 cu in) LS3 V8 producing 410 hp (416 PS; 306 kW) 2015\u20132017\nChevrolet Lumina coup\u00e9: rebadge of third generation Holden Monaro CV8, 5.7 L (350 cu in) LS1 V8 producing 350 hp (355 PS; 261 kW) 2002\u20132006\nChevrolet Lumina sedan: rebadge of Holden Commodore SS sedan 2000\u20132011\n\n\n=== South African market ===\nFor a short period of time in the early 1970s, a Holden Monaro\u2013based \"Chevrolet SS\" model, similar in design, size and drivetrain to a Nova SS, was available in South\nPersonal luxury car is a North American car classification describing somewhat sporty, sophisticated mass-market coup\u00e9s that emphasized comfort over performance. The North American manufacturers most often combined engineering, design, and marketing to develop upscale, distinctive \"platform sharing\" models that became highly profitable.\nAlthough luxury coupes had been produced in North America for several decades, the beginning of the \"personal luxury car\" market segment is generally considered to have started in 1958. It was the success of the Ford Thunderbird (second generation) when it was redesigned from a two-seat car to a four-seat vehicle. These changes shifted the Thunderbird's emphasis from sporting to comfort and luxury, and sales increased by 50 percent. The Thunderbird was sold for eleven generations up until the 2005 model year.\nThe longest-running nameplate of the personal luxury car was the 50-year production of the Cadillac Eldorado, which started in the 1953 model year, originally designating ultra-premium, low-volume versions of lower-priced Cadillac models, including the hand-built four-door 1957 Eldorado Brougham. According to Hemmings Motor News, Cadillac first entered the \"personal luxury car\" market in 1967, with a smaller high-volume model.\nBefore the late 1970s, personal luxury cars were usually large, rear-wheel drive vehicles powered by large V8 engines. As a result of the downsizing trend in the American automotive industry during the late 1970s, many personal luxury cars have been produced as mid-size cars with six-cylinder engines and front-wheel drive. By the 21st century, the personal luxury market had diminished as consumers migrated to other market segments.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nPersonal luxury cars are mass-market vehicles that have a combination of sports car and luxury car characteristics, typically two-door coup\u00e9s or convertibles, typically with a small rear seat not intended for regular use by adults. Personal luxury car designs emphasize comfort and convenience, often highly equipped with interior features that were either optional or not available on other models.\nIn contrast to the European grand tourer sporty luxury car, where high-speed performance was key, the American personal luxury car typically blunted performance by mating large engines to heavy vehicles. The cars were usually mass-produced and often shared major mechanical components with other models from the manufacturer to reduce production costs. \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1950s ===\n\n\n==== Niche market ====\nThe initial luxury cars of this category during the 1950s in the United States were expensive, niche market, low-volume vehicles. Described as \"quasi-custom\" models, marketers at the time promoted them as \"sports cars.\" This connoted \"anything with a convertible top, lots of performance, a few unique styling touches, and top-of-the-line price tag.\nThese included the Cadillac Eldorado, Buick Roadmaster Skylark, Oldsmobile 98 Fiesta, Imperial Newport, Chrysler New Yorker, Chrysler 300 and Chrysler Windsor, Packard Hawk, and Packard Caribbean. All models had two-door convertible or hardtop body styles, built on a platform shared with far less expensive models. The Eldorado represented 0.5% of Cadillac's total sales in 1953, with 1,690 Buick Skylarks, 458 Oldsmobile 98 Fiestas, and 750 Packard Caribbeans sold. The styling of 1950s luxury cars has been described as a \"baroque excess\".\nAn example is the Continental Mark II introduced for the 1956 model year. With a price of approximately US$10,000 (equivalent to $112,069 in 2023), the cost was equivalent to a Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud, and 3,012 Mark IIs were sold from 1955 until 1957. It was produced in the two-door hardtop body style with extensive standard equipment for the time that included power steering, power brakes, power windows, power seats, power vent windows, leather interior, and a tachometer. The only option was air conditioning for $595.\n\n\n==== Mass market ====\n\nThe Grand Prix is a line of automobiles produced by the Pontiac Division of General Motors from 1962 until 2002 as coupes and from 1989 through 2008 model years as four-door sedans.\nFirst introduced as a full-size performance coupe for the 1962 model year, the model repeatedly varied in size, luxury, and performance over successive generations. The Grand Prix was the most expensive coupe Pontiac offered until the 1970s, when the Bonneville Brougham and the Firebird Trans Am became more exclusive; the Grand Prix moved into the intermediate personal luxury car and later the mid-size market segments.\nAll Grand Prixs from 1962 through 1972 were pillarless hardtops (except for the 1967 convertible).\n\n\n== First generation (1962\u20131964) ==\n\nThe Grand Prix was an all-new model for Pontiac in the 1962 model year as a performance-oriented personal luxury car. Based on the Pontiac Catalina two-door hardtop, Pontiac included unique interior trim with bucket seats and a center console in the front to make the new model a lower-priced entry in the growing personal-luxury segment. The Grand Prix was available with luxury features from the longer, top-line Bonneville coupe. The bucket seats were upholstered in \"Morrokide\" vinyl, while nylon loop-blend carpeting covered the floor and lower door panels. It was also installed with a center console with a transmission shifter, tachometer, four-barrel carburetor, dual exhausts, and \"acceleration\" rear axle ratio (3.42:1). It used the Catalina coupe platform with minimal outside chrome trim, and included the 303 hp (226 kW) \"Trophy\" version of 389 cu in (6.4 L) V8 engine with a three-speed manual transmission or optional console-mounted four-speed manual or Hydra-Matic automatic.\nThe Grand Prix featured distinctive grille and taillights. It effectively replaced the Pontiac Ventura model while the Catalina was available with an optional \"Ventura\" trim package for 1962. The rear bench seat included a center fold-down armrest and a speaker grille that could be made functional with the extra-cost Bi-Phonic rear speaker. Included were a padded instrument panel, deluxe steering wheel, courtesy lights, and other features. The listed retail price before optional equipment was $3,490 ($35,153 in 2023 dollars ) and was the most expensive model when it was introduced.\n\nThe standard engine was the Bonneville's 303 hp (226 kW) 389 cu in (6.4 L) V8, which came with four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts. Tri-Power carburation (with three two-barrels) raised output to 318 hp (237 kW). Two other high-performance 389s were offered, including a four-barrel version rated at 333 hp (248 kW) and a 348 hp (260 kW) Tri-Power. Late in the model year a \"street\" version of the race-orientated 421 Pontiac offered in 1961 and 1962 became available, but only in a four-barrel form rated at 320 hp (240 kW). Pontiac also offered the 421 cu in (7 L) Super Duty with two four-barrel carburetors, rated at 405 hp (302 kW), as a US$2,250 option ($22,663 in 2023 dollars ).\nJohn DeLorean, head of Advanced Engineering at Pontiac, contributed to the development of the Grand Prix as well as the GTO.\n\n\n=== 1963 ===\n\nFor the 1963 model year, the Grand Prix received revised sheet metal shared with other full-size Pontiacs, but with a squared-off roofline featuring a concave rear window that contrasted with the convertible-like roof styling of the previous year. New was a split grille with vertically stacked headlights and round parking lights as well as \"hidden\" taillights. Aside from grille work, taillight covering, and bumpers, chrome trim was limited to lower rocker panels, wheel arches, and roofline.\nThe Grand Prix continued with luxurious interiors featuring real walnut trim on the instrument panel and bucket seats upholstered in \"Morrokide\" vinyl. The center console was now built into the instrument panel and featured an intake manifold pressure vacuum gauge along with a dash-mounted tachometer for cars with manual transmission. Pedals r\nThe Chevrolet Chevelle  is a mid-sized automobile that was produced by Chevrolet in three generations for the 1964 through 1977 model years. Part of the General Motors (GM) A-body platform, the Chevelle was one of Chevrolet's most successful nameplates. Body styles included coupes, sedans, convertibles, and station wagons. The \"Super Sport\" versions were produced through the 1973 model year and Lagunas from 1973 through to 1976.\nAfter a four-year absence, the El Camino was reintroduced as part of the new Chevelle lineup in 1964.\nThe G-body Monte Carlo, introduced in 1970, also used a platform based heavily on the Chevelle platform, although it was lengthened ahead of the firewall.\nFrom 1964 through 1969, GM of Canada sold a modified version of the Chevelle that included a Pontiac-style grille, and a LeMans instrument panel, marketed as the Beaumont.\nThe Malibu was the top-of-the-line model through 1972, and completely replaced the Chevelle nameplate starting with the redesigned, and downsized 1978 model year.\n\n\n== First generation (1964\u20131967) ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\nThe automobile marketplace was changing significantly during the early 1960s and featured increased competition in the smaller-sized car segments. The domestic Big Three automakers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) were responding to the success of American Motors' compact Rambler American, and Classic models that made AMC the leading maker of small cars for several years and increasing Rambler on the 1961 domestic sales charts to third-place behind Chevrolet and Ford. The innovative Chevrolet Corvair, and the Chevy II, which was designed to compete with Ford's Falcon, were losing ground. Ford released the mid-sized Fairlane in 1962, to which Chevrolet responded with the 1964 Chevelle based on a new A platform design. Built on a 115-inch (2,900 mm) wheelbase, the new Chevelle was similar in size, simplicity, and concept to what was classified as the \"standard-sized\" 1955\u20131957 Chevrolet models. The Chevelle was the U.S. auto industry's only all-new car for 1964, and was positioned to fill the gap between the small Chevy II and the full-sized Chevrolet models. Introduced in August 1963 by \"Bunkie\" Knudsen, the Chevelle filled the gap in market coverage for Chevrolet, and achieved sales of 338,286 for the year.\n\nOriginally conceived as an upsizing of the Chevy II with a unibody platform (similar to the Fairlane, and the full-size Chrysler B-platform of the same era), which originated with the XP-726 program, GM's \"senior compact\" A-platform used a body-on-frame construction using a suspension setup similar to its full-sized automobiles with a four-link rear suspension (the axle has four control arms which are attached to the frame with rear coil springs sandwiched between the axle, and spring pocket\u2014this design was used with the B platform vehicles). The name \"chevelle\" has been speculated as influenced by gazelle and Chevrolet combined, as a smaller sedan to the Impala.\nTwo-door hardtop coupes, and convertibles, four-door sedans, and four-door station wagons were offered throughout the entire run. This also included a coupe utility (El Camino) derivative of the two-door wagon. In line with other Chevrolet series, the two-door hardtops were called Sport coupes. Four-door hardtops, dubbed Sport Sedans, were available (1966 through 1972). A two-door sedan and station wagon was available in 1964 and 1965 in the base 300 series. These economy-focused models included a simulated floor carpet made of vinyl-coated rubber color-matched to four available interior colors. The station wagons were marketed with exclusive nameplates: Greenbrier (previously used with the Corvair based vans), Concours, and Concours Estate. Two six-cylinder engines, and several V8s were offered in every model.\nChevelles were also assembled, and sold in Canada. While similar to their stateside counterparts, the convertible was available in the base Chevelle series, a model never offered in the United\nThe Chevrolet Beretta is a coup\u00e9 that was produced by Chevrolet from 1987 until 1996. Alongside the four-door Chevrolet Corsica, the Beretta served as the successor to the Chevrolet Citation. Slotted between the Cavalier and Lumina/Monte Carlo coupes, the Beretta was distinguished by its vertical door handles mounted on the B-pillar, a design feature later used by the Chevrolet Lumina coupe and its GM W-body counterparts.\nThe Beretta shared the front-wheel drive GM L platform with the Corsica; replacing the X-body platform, the L-body was designed by Chevrolet, with the rest of General Motors using the Oldsmobile-designed N-body. The body was designed in the same design studio as the contemporary Camaro and Corvette. For 1990, a Beretta convertible conversion was selected as the Indianapolis 500 pace car; though a replica was initially considered as a convertible, the production replica was offered as a coupe.\nDuring its production, the Beretta was assembled alongside the Corsica and Pontiac Tempest sedans (the latter sold only in Canada) in GM facilities in Wilmington, Delaware, and Linden, New Jersey.\n\n\n== Models and changes ==\nBase model Berettas were equipped with the same powertrain as the Chevrolet Cavalier, the 2.2 L OHV 4-cylinder engine and the 3-speed automatic transmission by default, or the 60-degree V6. A 5-speed manual was available only by special order if paired with the 2.2 L OHV, however very few special orders ever took place, and the 3-speed automatic was the default option.\n\nThe GT included a 125 hp 2.8-liter V6, which grew to a 3.1 L in 1990, and the Z51 suspension package with 15-inch styled steel wheels and Goodyear Eagle GT tires. Also included was a sport cloth interior and sport steering wheel. The GTU was available from 1988 until the 1990 model year. Beretta GTUs (with the FE7 suspension package) were shipped to Cars and Concepts where they were equipped with 16x7-inch aluminum alloy wheels, custom body kits, a rear spoiler, mirrors, custom trim, and decals. With the FE7 Chevrolet claimed the Beretta GTU would deliver 0.92 g on the skid pad, a claim that most magazines of the day failed to duplicate. GTUs were only available in black, red and white.\nThe GTZ, which replaced the GTU, took over as the high-performance version of the Beretta. It was produced from 1990 until 1993. It came standard with Oldsmobile's 2.3-liter, high output Quad 4 inline-four, which produced 180 hp (134 kW) and 160 lb\u22c5ft (217 N\u22c5m) of torque, giving it a 0\u201360 mph time of 7.6 seconds. Also standard was a Getrag 5-speed manual transmission and GM's FE7 performance suspension.\nMotor Trend's only complaint was the Quad 4's noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) and noted it was one of the most raucous engines of its time. Beginning in 1991, the 3.1 L V6 could be had as an option on the GTZ, but it was only available with a 3-speed automatic transmission that increased the 0-to-60 mph time to around 9.0 seconds. The 3.1 L V6 was standard on 1990\u20131992 GT models and optional for all base models and GTs in 1992. Starting in the 1994 model year, the 3.1 L V6 could only be ordered with an automatic transmission.\nThe 1991 model year saw major interior updates, including a new dashboard and center console and the addition of a driver's side airbag.\nIn 1994, the GT and GTZ were replaced by the Beretta Z26, which put it squarely between the Cavalier Z24 and Lumina Z34 in Chevrolet's lineup. The Z26 had a 0\u201360 mph time of 8.3 seconds. The 3.1 L V6 was redesigned and became the 3100 V6 and gained 20 hp at 160. The new 3100 V6 was only available with a new 4-speed automatic transmission. The Quad 4 HO lost a total of 10 hp (7 kW) in 1994, its last year of production, down to 170 hp (127 kW). The 2.3 L Quad 4 was only available with a 5-speed manual transmission. In 1995, the 3100 V6 lost 5 hp, down to 155 hp (116 kW), which also carried on to the 1996 model.\nBeretta sales steadily declined every year of production as the market turned away fr\nThe Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme is a mid-size car produced by Oldsmobile between 1966 and 1997. It was positioned as a premium offering at the top of the Cutlass range. It began as a trim package, developed its own roofline, and rose during the mid-1970s to become not only the most popular Oldsmobile but the highest selling model in its class.\nIt was produced as a rear-wheel drive two-door hardtop, sedan, and station wagon into the 1980s, and a convertible through 1972.  In 1988 Oldsmobile sought to capitalize on the brand equity of the Cutlass Supreme marque by replacing it with a downsized front-wheel drive model based on the GM10 platform W-platform.\nWhen production ended there was no direct replacement for the Cutlass Supreme, although the Intrigue introduced for 1998 was designed in size and price to replace all the Cutlass models.\n\n\n== First generation (1966\u20131967) ==\n\nThe Cutlass Supreme name first appeared for the 1966 model year, the first year of GM's new intermediate four-door hardtop sedan\u2014also known as the Holiday Sedan. In addition to the new body style (also available on the midline F-85 Deluxe series), the Supreme featured a plusher interior that included a bench seat with armrest, full wheel covers and deluxe door panels among other items including \"CS\" emblems on the rear C-pillars and trunk lid. Although smaller than the traditional domestic cars, \"its deluxe interior makes it comparable with LTD, VIP, DPL, and Caprice.\"\nFor the 1967 model year, the Cutlass Supreme line was expanded into a full series that also included a two-door hardtop coupe (Holiday Coupe), two-door pillared coupe (Sport Coupe), four-door pillared sedan (Town Sedan) and a convertible. Generally, interior appointments in Supreme models were more luxurious than lesser F-85 and Cutlass series cars and included a cloth or \"Morocceen\" vinyl bench seat with armrest in sedan models and all-vinyl Strato bucket seats in coupes and convertibles.\nFor both years, the standard Supreme engine was Oldsmobile's 330 cu in (5.4 L) \"Ultra High Compression\" Jetfire Rocket V8 rated at 320 hp (239 kW) with a four-barrel carburetor. Transmission offerings included a standard three-speed manual with column shift, floor-mounted four-speed manual with Hurst shifter or a two-speed Jetaway automatic.\nIn 1967, the high-performance 442 package with the 400 cu in (6.6 L) 350 horsepower (260 kW) V8 was available on three Cutlass Supreme models including the sport coupe, Holiday coupe and convertible. Also available on each of those three Supreme two-door models was \"Turnpike Cruiser\" option that included a 400 cubic-inch V8 with two-barrel carburetor and 300 hp (220 kW) rating along with a numerically lower rear axle and Turbo Hydramatic transmission.\n\n\n== Second generation (1968\u20131972) ==\n\nThe Cutlass and other GM intermediates were completely restyled for 1968 with wheelbases shortened to 112 inches (2,845 mm) for 2-door coupe models and lengthened one inch to 116 in (2,946 mm) for four-door sedans and station wagons (with the exception of the glass-roof Vista Cruiser station wagon, which rode on an even longer 121-inch (3,100 mm) wheelbase). The Cutlass Supreme, now the top-line Olds intermediate series, was pared down to two- and four-door hardtop models with the pillared sedans and coupes dropped and the convertible moved to the lower-priced Cutlass \"S\" line, upon which the 4-4-2 muscle car was now based. Also the standard Rocket V8 was enlarged from 330 to 350 cubic inches with 310 hp (231 kW).\n\nThe 1969 models received only a minor facelift such as a new split grille and vertical taillights with the same model and engine offerings. A new three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic 350 was added to the option list to replace the two-speed Jetaway automatic. Headrests were made standard equipment due to federal safety mandate and the ignition switch moved from the instrument panel to the steering column, which also was designed to lock the steering wheel. This ignition/steering wh\nThe Cook Out 400 is an annual NASCAR Cup Series stock car race held at the Richmond Raceway in Richmond, Virginia, being the second of two races at the track with the first one being the Toyota Owners 400 in the spring.\nThis race was previously the final race before the Cup Series playoffs (previously \"the Chase\") began since NASCAR implemented them for the 2004 season until 2018 when it was moved into the playoffs (replacing the race at Chicagoland which was moved to June). The Brickyard 400 became the last race before the playoffs in 2018, replacing Richmond, and was again in 2019 and then the Coke Zero Sugar 400 at Daytona became the last race of the playoffs in 2020 and still is today, excluding 2024. In 2022, the race was taken out of the playoffs and moved to August. In 2023, the race was moved again to the last weekend in July.\nAustin Dillon is the defending winner of this event, having won it in 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nStarting in 1991, the race was moved from Sunday afternoon to Saturday night. It became the second night race on the NASCAR schedule, following Bristol which took place a few weeks earlier.\nFrom 2000 to 2009, the race was sponsored in some form by Chevrolet. For 2001 and 2002, the race sponsorship was in conjunction with Warner Bros., with Looney Tunes characters featured in several cars' paint jobs. For the 2003\u20132009 races, the race was known as the Chevy Rock and Roll 400, and various cars promoted various rock music acts. The 2010 race saw the sponsorship move from Chevrolet to the Air National Guard, a branch of the United States Air Force. The race was sponsored by Roll Global through its Wonderful Pistachios brand, a division of Roll Global subsidiary Paramount Nuts in 2011. On May 2, 2012, Federated Auto Parts and Richmond International Raceway announced that Federated Auto Parts would become the race's sponsor starting in 2012.\nThe most notable year of this race is arguably the 2013 race, which was marred by a team orders scheme (referred to as Spingate) designed to manipulate the outcome of the race and Chase positions in the final ten laps after Clint Bowyer intentionally spun out to allow Brian Vickers to pit after a restart from the caution so that Martin Truex Jr. could secure a spot in the Chase, and a separate manipulation where David Gilliland was asked to slow down to allow Joey Logano to pass so that Logano could secure a spot in the Chase. NASCAR penalized the teams involved in the scheme (Michael Waltrip Racing, Penske Racing, and Front Row Motorsports) which therefore eliminated Truex from that year's Chase, while Jeff Gordon was given a thirteenth slot (in a usually twelve-driver battle) in the Chase as a compensation. (Gordon would have been 10th in points and made it in on points instead of Logano if Logano had not passed Gilliland. Had this manipulation have not occurred, Logano would have been 11th in points but still gotten into the Chase by being in one of two wild card positions outside the top 10 in points, which is why he wasn't kicked out of the Chase like Truex. Gordon would have not qualified for a wild card spot due to being winless.) Carl Edwards would win that year's race.\nWhen the race was run in close proximity to (and it occasionally being run on) Patriot Day (9/11), the Pledge of Allegiance was included as part of the opening ceremony. The 2021 race, which took place on the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, was called the Federated Auto Parts 400 Salute to First Responders.\nCook Out Restaurants would become the title sponsor of the race in 2023, replacing Federated Auto Parts.\n\n\n== Past winners ==\n\n1969: Race shortened from 500 laps due to rain.\n1988: Track reconfigured to 0.75 miles.\n1991: Race moved to a Saturday night event.\n2008: Race postponed from Saturday night to Sunday afternoon due to rain.\n2012: Race started late due to rain; race finished on Sunday approximately 1:30am.\n2016, 2017 and 2024: Race extended due to an overtime finish.\n\n\n=== Trac\nThe Chevrolet Impala () is a full-size car that was built by Chevrolet for model years 1958 to 1985, 1994 to 1996, and 2000 to 2020. The Impala was Chevrolet's popular flagship passenger car and was among the better-selling American-made automobiles in the United States.\nFor its debut in 1958, the Impala was distinguished from other models by its symmetrical triple taillights. The Chevrolet Caprice was introduced as a top-line Impala Sport Sedan for model year 1965, later becoming a separate series positioned above the Impala in 1966, which, in turn, remained above the Chevrolet Bel Air and the Chevrolet Biscayne. The Impala continued as Chevrolet's most popular full-sized model through the mid-1980s. Between 1994 and 1996, the Impala was revised as a 5.7-liter V8\u2013powered version of the Chevrolet Caprice Classic sedan.\nIn 2000, the Impala was reintroduced again as a mainstream front-wheel drive car. In February 2014, the 2014 Impala ranked No. 1 among Affordable Large Cars in U.S. News & World Report's rankings. When the 10th generation of the Impala was introduced for the 2014 model year, the 9th generation was rebadged as the Impala Limited and sold only to fleet customers through 2016. During that time, both versions were sold in the United States and Canada. The 10th-generation Impala was also sold in the Middle East and South Korea.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nThe Impala name was first used for the full-sized 1956 General Motors Motorama show car that bore Corvette-like design cues, especially the grille. It was named Impala after the graceful African antelope, which was used as the car's logo. Painted emerald green metallic, with a white interior, the Impala concept car featured hardtop styling. Clare MacKichan's design team, along with designers from Pontiac, started to establish basic packaging and dimensions for their shared 1958 General Motors \"A\" body in June. The first styling sketch that directly influenced the finished Chevrolet automobile was seen by General Motors Styling Vice President Harley Earl in October. Seven months later, the basic design was developed.\n\n\n== First generation (1958) ==\n\nFor 1958, GM was promoting its 50th year of production, and introduced anniversary models for each brand; Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Chevrolet. The 1958 models shared a common appearance on the top models for each brand; Cadillac Eldorado Seville, Buick Limited Riviera, Oldsmobile Starfire 98, Pontiac Bonneville Catalina, and the Chevrolet Bel-Air Impala.\nThe Impala was introduced for the 1958 model year as a top-of-the-line Bel Air in 2-door hardtops and convertibles. From the windshield (A) pillar rearward, the 1958 Bel Air Impala differed structurally from the lower-priced Chevrolet models. Hardtops had a slightly shorter greenhouse and longer rear deck. The wheelbase of the Impala was longer than the lower-priced models, although the overall length was identical. Interiors held a two-spoke steering wheel and color-keyed door panels with brushed aluminum trim. No other series included a convertible.\nThe 1958 Chevrolet models were longer, lower, and wider than their predecessors. The 1958 model year was the first with dual headlamps. The tailfins of the 1957 were replaced by deeply sculptured rear fenders. Impalas had three taillights each side, while lesser models had two and wagons just one. The Impalas included crossed-flag insignias above the side moldings, as well as bright rocker moldings and dummy rear-fender scoops.\nThe standard perimeter-type frame was abandoned, replaced by a unit with rails laid out in the form of an elongated \"X\". Chevrolet claimed that the new frame offered increased torsional rigidity and allowed for a lower placement of the passenger compartment. This was a transitional step between traditional construction and the later fully unitized body/chassis; the body structure was also strengthened in the rocker panels and firewall. However, this frame was not as effective in protecting the inte\nThe Chevrolet 90\u00b0 V6 family of V6 engines began in 1978 with the Chevrolet 200 cu in (3.3 L) as the base engine for the all new 1978 Chevrolet Malibu. The original engine family was phased out in early 2014, with its final use as the 4.3 L (262 cu in) V6 engine used in Chevrolet and GMC trucks and vans. Its phaseout marks the end of an era of Chevrolet small-block engine designs dating back to the 1955 model year. A new Generation V 4.3 L (262 cu in) V6 variant entered production in late 2013, based on the LT1 small block V8 and first used in the 2014 Silverado/Sierra 1500 trucks.\n\n\n== Generation I ==\nThese engines have a 90\u00b0 V-block with 12 valves activated by a pushrod valvetrain. All engines have cast iron blocks and cylinder heads. The engines are based on the Chevrolet Small-Block engine, and the V6 is formed by the removal of the #3 and #6 cylinders. The V6s share the same 4.4-inch (110 mm) bore spacing and 9.025-inch (229.2 mm) deck height as the V8 engines. Many parts are interchangeable between the 90\u00b0 V6 and the small block V8 including valvetrain components, some bearings, piston assemblies, lubrication and cooling system components, and external accessories. The 90\u00b0 V6 engine uses the same transmission bellhousing pattern as the Chevrolet small-block V8 engine. The oil pan dipstick is located on the passenger side above the oil pan rail; this design was phased in on both the 90\u00b0 V6 and Small Block Chevrolet assembly lines (for engines manufactured after 1979) sharing the same casting dies. All the engines use a 1-6-5-4-3-2 firing order. The engines in this family are longitudinal engines, and have been used in rear-wheel drive cars and trucks, industrial, and marine applications. Until 2014, the Chevrolet 90\u00b0 V6 was produced at the GM Powertrain Division plant in Romulus, Michigan.\n\n\n=== 3.3L (200 CID) ===\nIntroduced in 1978, the 200 cu in (3.3 L) replaced the larger 250 cu in (4.1 L) as the base engine for Chevrolet's new downsized intermediate line. The 200 cu in (3.3 L) used a unique 3.5-by-3.48-inch (88.9 mm \u00d7 88.4 mm) bore and stroke (the Chevrolet 305 and 350 cu in (5.0 and 5.7 L) V8 engines shared the same stroke dimension). These bore and stroke dimensions were later used by the 267 cu in (4.4 L) V8 Chevrolet engine. Also like the small block V8 engines, the 200 cu in (3.3 L) V6 used 2.45-inch (62.2 mm) main bearings and 2.1-inch (53.3 mm) rod bearing diameters.\nBeing a 90\u00b0 V6, Chevrolet took steps to eliminate the rough running tendencies of the 200. The crankshaft has each of its connecting rod throws offset by 18 degrees for each pair of rods. This required the connecting rods to have 0.05-inch (1.3 mm) narrower ends as well as a thrust bearing to be installed between each pair of rods. However, the connecting rods were still the same 5.7-inch (140 mm) length as most other small-block Chevrolet V8 engines. This produced an engine with a semi-even fire sequence of 132 degrees/108 degrees.\nThe 200 cu in (3.3 L) V6 was only produced for 1978 and 1979. It was available only with a 2-barrel carburetor. In 1978, the 200 cu in (3.3 L) used the Rochester 2GC carburetor and in 1979 it used a Rochester Dualjet carburetor. The smaller Dualjet carburetor caused a slight decrease in power.\n\n\n=== 3.8L (229 CID) ===\nThe 229 cu in (3.8 L) engine was first introduced for the 1980 model year. This engine replaced the 250 cu in (4.1 L) straight-six in full-size Chevrolets and Camaros as the base six-cylinder engine. Additionally, the intermediate Chevrolet Malibu and Monte Carlo also used the 229 cu in (3.8 L) as a replacement for both the 200 cu in (3.3 L) V6 and the 231 cu in (3.8 L) Buick V6. Checker Motors Corporation also used this engine starting with its 1980 A11 Taxi and A12 Marathon sedans. Both the Buick V6 and the 229 cu in (3.8 L) Chevrolet V6 are 90\u00b0 V6 engines, and are often referred to as the 3.8L V6. These engines should not be confused as being the same, and are unique engine designs.\nThe 229 cu in (3.8 L)\nThe High Value engine family from General Motors is a group of cam-in-block or overhead valve V6 engines. These engines feature cast iron blocks and aluminum heads, and use the same 60\u00b0 vee bank as the 60\u00b0 V6 family they are based on, but the new 99 mm (3.90 in) bore required offsetting the bores by 1.5 mm (0.059 in) away from the engine center line. These engines (aside from the LX9) are the first cam-in-block engines to implement variable valve timing, and won the 2006 Breakthrough Award from Popular Mechanics for this innovation. For the 2007 model year, the 3900 engine featured optional displacement on demand or \"Active Fuel Management\" which deactivates a bank of cylinders under light load to increase highway fuel economy. It was rumored that GM would produce a 3-valve design, but that never came to be. These engines were produced primarily at the GM factory in Tonawanda, New York, and at the Ramos Arizpe engine plant in Mexico. The assembly line for this engine was manufactured by Hirata Corporation at its powertrain facility in Kumamoto, Japan.\nAs of the 2012 model year, GM no longer sells these engines in any U.S. market vehicles.\n\n\n== 3.5 ==\nThese engines should not be confused with the 3.5L DOHC LX5 (Shortstar) V6 engine.\n\n\n=== LX9 ===\nThe LX9 3500 is an OHV engine based on the 3400 V6. Bore and stroke are 94 mm \u00d7 84 mm (3.70 in \u00d7 3.31 in), for a displacement of 3.5 L; 213.5 cu in (3,498 cc). According to a GM press release from October 2002, the 3500 V6 offered improved performance and fuel efficiency, as well as reduced emissions and NVH compared to the 3400 V6. The 3500 V6 featured an updated powertrain control module, electronic throttle control, fuel injection system, exhaust manifold, catalytic converter, accessory drive system, and improved cooling and sealing systems. Power output ranges from 196 hp (146 kW) to 201 hp (150 kW), and torque ranges from 213 lb\u22c5ft (289 N\u22c5m) to 221 lb\u22c5ft (300 N\u22c5m).\nApplications:\n\n2005\u20132006 Buick Terraza/Chevrolet Uplander/Pontiac Montana SV6/Saturn Relay\n2004\u20132006 Chevrolet Malibu/Chevrolet Malibu Maxx\n2005\u20132006 Pontiac G6 Sedan / Coupe\n2006\u20132007 Buick Rendezvous\n2006 Pontiac G6 GT Convertible\n\n\n=== LZ4 ===\n\nThe LZ4 3500 is an OHV engine that uses a block similar to the 3.9L LZ9 V6. It was introduced for the 2006 model year Impala and Monte Carlo. Bore is the same 99 mm (3.90 in), but the stroke is reduced to 76 mm (2.99 in) for a displacement of 3.5 L; 214.2 cu in (3,510 cc). It includes continuously variable cam timing (fixed overlap). Output is 211 hp (157 kW) at 5800 rpm and 214 lb\u22c5ft (290 N\u22c5m) at 4000 rpm. Horsepower rating changed for the 2007 model year to 224 hp (167 kW) at 5800 rpm and 220 lb\u22c5ft (298 N\u22c5m) torque at 4000 rpm.  The Chevrolet Malibu, Pontiac G6, and Saturn Aura came equipped with this engine for 2007 (previously, the Malibu and G6 had the non-VVT 201 hp (150 kW) 3.5 L LX9). In 2008, the SAE horsepower rating was dropped to 219 hp (163 kW), keeping torque as is. On Pontiac G6 convertible models, horsepower was rated at 217 hp (162 kW).\nApplications:\n\n2006\u20132009 Chevrolet Impala\n2006\u20132007 Chevrolet Monte Carlo\n2007\u20132010 Chevrolet Malibu/Chevrolet Malibu Maxx\n2007\u20132009 Saturn Aura\n2008\u20132010 Pontiac G6\n2008\u20132009 Saturn Vue XE AWD (222 hp (166 kW)/220 lb\u22c5ft (298 N\u22c5m))\nNote: GM often refers to this engine in its literature as a \"3.5L V6 with Variable Valve Timing.\"\n\n\n=== LZE ===\nThe LZE 3500 is an OHV flexible-fuel engine based on the 3.5L LZ4 V6 (it can use either plain gasoline or E85) and includes continuously variable cam timing (fixed overlap).

It is promoted as NASCAR's second-tier circuit to the organization's top level Cup Series. NXS events are frequently held as a support race on the day prior to a Cup Series event scheduled for that weekend.\nThe series was previously called the Budweiser Late Model Sportsman Series in 1982 and 1983, the NASCAR Busch Grand National Series from 1984 through 2002, the NASCAR Busch Series from 2003 through 2007, and the NASCAR Nationwide Series from 2008 through 2014. Since 2015, it is sponsored by Comcast via its consumer cable and wireless brand Xfinity.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe series emerged from NASCAR's Sportsman division, which had been formed in 1950 as NASCAR's short track race division. It was NASCAR's fourth series (after the Modified and Roadster series in 1948 and Strictly Stock Series in 1949). The sportsman cars were not current model cars and could be modified more, but not as much as Modified series cars. It became the Late Model Sportsman Series in 1968, and soon featured races on larger tracks such as Daytona International Speedway. Drivers used obsolete Grand National cars on larger tracks but by the inception of the touring format in 1982, the series used older compact cars. Short track cars with relatively small 300 cubic inch V-8 motors were used. Drivers used smaller current year models featuring V6 motors.\nThe modern-day Xfinity Series was formed in 1982, when Anheuser-Busch sponsored a newly reformed late-model sportsman series with its Budweiser brand. In 1984, the series switched sponsorship to Anheuser-Busch's Busch Beer brand and was renamed the Busch Grand National Series.\n\"Grand National\" was dropped from the series' title in 2003 as part of NASCAR's brand identity (the \"Grand National\" name was later used for the Busch East and Winston West series as part of a nationwide standardization of rules for NASCAR's regional racing; both series are now run under ARCA Menards Series banner after NASCAR purchased the organization in 2018). Anheuser-Busch dropped the sponsorship after the 2007 season; Nationwide Insurance took over the sponsorship for the 2008 season, renaming it the Nationwide Series. The Nationwide sponsorship was a seven-year contract, and did not include the banking and mortgage departments of Nationwide. The sponsorship reportedly carried a $10 million commitment for 2008, with 6% annual escalations thereafter.\nOn September 3, 2014, it was announced that Comcast would become the new title sponsor of the series via its cable television and internet brand Xfinity, renaming it the Xfinity Series. In 2016, NASCAR implemented a seven-race Chase system similar to the one used in the NASCAR Cup Series.\nXfinity race fields have varied in the number of drivers. Prior to 2013, the grid size resembled its Cup counterpart with 43 cars per race; that year, it shrank to 40 maximum cars. The field was further reduced in 2019 and 2020 to 38 and 36, respectively. During the 2020 season, fields were temporarily increased to 40 cars again to accommodate part-time teams that were otherwise unable to qualify due to such sessions being canceled in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n== Races held outside the U.S. ==\nOn March 6, 2005, the series held its first race outside the United States, the Telcel-Motorola 200. The race was held in Mexico City, Mexico at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, a track that has held Formula One and Champ Car races in the past. It was won by Martin Truex Jr. On August 4, 2007, the series held its second race outside the United States, at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, Quebec, another road course. It was won by Kevin Harvick, while Quebec native Patrick Carpentier finished second. In July 2008, NASCAR announced that the Nationwide Series would not return to Mexico City in 2009, and in 2012 they announced that it would not be returning to Montreal in 2013.\n\n\n== Tracks ==\n\nWhile the Xfinity Ser\nThe GM A platform (commonly called A-body) was a rear wheel drive automobile platform designation used by General Motors from 1925 until 1959, and again from 1964 to 1981. In 1982, GM introduced a new front wheel drive A platform, and existing intermediate rear wheel drive products were redesignated as G-bodies.\n\n\n== 1926-1959 ==\n\nThe earliest GM A-bodied based cars shared a common chassis with the Chevrolet Superior, with Pontiac Six replacing Oakland starting in 1926. Oldsmobile also used the A-body for the 1938\u201348 Series 60. All Chevrolets produced during this period, to include the Chevrolet Master and the Chevrolet Deluxe, and all 1936-39 Pontiacs, the 1940 Pontiac Special, the 1941 Pontiac Deluxe Torpedo and all Pontiac Torpedoes produced from 1942 through 1948 were A-bodies.\nFrom 1949 to 1957, only Chevrolets (150, 210, Bel Air, Del Ray) and  Pontiacs (Chieftain, Star Chief, Super Chief) were built on the A-body. These cars were moved to the new B Body shared with some Buicks and Oldsmobiles in 1958, and all truck conversions were replaced by the C/K series in 1960.\n\n\n=== Vehicles underpinned ===\n\n\n== 1964\u20131967 ==\n\nThe A-body platform returned as an intermediate-sized platform introduced in the 1964 model year for two redesigned  and two new mid-sized cars from four of GM divisions. Notable examples include the FR layout Chevrolet Chevelle, Buick Special, Oldsmobile Cutlass and Pontiac Tempest. The A-body cars were the first intermediate-sized cars designed with a full perimeter frame and four-link coil-spring rear suspension, similar to that introduced on full-sized Pontiacs and Oldsmobiles in 1961 and on all other GM full-sized cars in 1965.\nThe Chevrolet A-body line included the El Camino coupe utility. Two station wagons based on the A-body used stretched wheelbases and raised rear roof sections with skylights: the 1964\u20131972 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser and the 1964\u201369 Buick Sport Wagon.\nAll A-body cars had a 115 in (292 cm) wheelbase except the stretched-wheelbase wagons, which were 120 in (305 cm).\nSome of GM's most successful products in the muscle car era were A-body models, including the Pontiac GTO, Chevrolet Malibu SS, Oldsmobile 442 and Buick GS. From 1964 to 1969, GM Canada produced a special-market version of the Chevelle called the Beaumont, which included Pontiac-type trim and unique front grilles as well as taillight assemblies.\nWhen the A-body cars were introduced in 1964, GM had set a corporate policy prohibiting V8 engines larger than 330 cu in (5.4 L) in these models. However, Pontiac fitted its 389 cu in (6.37 L) V8 in the Lemans to create the GTO \u2014 commonly considered the first popular muscle car. Though this violated the 330 cu in limit, Pontiac got around the rules by designating the GTO as a low-volume option package rather than a specific model. The sales success of the 1964 GTO led the corporation to increase the cubic inch limit for 1965 A-body cars to 400 cu in (6.6 L), opening the door for the other three divisions to offer similar muscle cars. The 400 cu in limit for A-body cars, as well as for other GM cars that were smaller than full-sized (with the exception of the Chevrolet Corvette), was continued through the 1969 model year.\n\n\n=== Vehicles underpinned ===\n\n\n== 1968-1972 ==\n\nAll GM A-bodies were completely restyled in 1968. The 400 cu in limit remained. It was removed in 1970, mainly due to Chrysler's domination in the drag racing and muscle car market with larger engines and highest power rated engines available in nearly all Chrysler \"B\" platform models. This led each of the four GM divisions to offer their largest engines: Chevrolet's 454 cu in (7.44 L) in the Chevelle SS-454, Pontiac's 455 cu in (7.46 L) in the GTO, Oldsmobile's 455 cu in (7.46 L) in the 442, and Buick's 455 cu in (7.46 L) in the GS.\nThe two-door had a 112 in (280 cm) wheelbase; four-door, station wagon, and the El Camino had a 116 in (290 cm) wheelbase; and the stretched-wheelbase wagon had a 121 in (310 cm) wheelba\nThe Generation 3 refers to the generation of stock cars used in NASCAR from 1981 to 1991, and it was used in the Busch Series until 1993. In this generation, NASCAR downsized the cars to better resemble cars on the showroom floor (with wheelbase at 110 inches), and body panels were still purchased through the manufacturers.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Cup Series ===\nThe Generation 3 era began in 1981 and, as a consequence of the second aero war between General Motors and Ford that also extended to their production models, featured bigger spoilers, and streamlined designs that barely resembled their showroom counterparts. The wheelbase was reduced to 110 inches in response to the demand of the production car market at the time, making the cars smaller than the previous two generations.\nThese were the cars that necessitated restrictor plates at Daytona and Talladega. In 1987 at Talladega, Bill Elliott set what remains the NASCAR qualifying record of 212.809 mph (342.483 km/h) at Talladega, circling the track in 44.998 seconds. But soon into the race, Bobby Allison's car went airborne and nearly went into the main grandstands, and that was the last unrestricted race on either of the two giant tracks. He also set the qualifying lap of 210.364 mph (338.548 km/h) at Daytona in 1987, circling the oval in 42.783 seconds, which still stands today. NASCAR mandated smaller carburetors for the rest of that season, and in 1988 required the restrictor plates.\nThe Generation 3 cars were used until 1991. It was the last generation without roof flaps (mandated in 1994). It was succeeded by the Generation 4 cars in 1992. In that same year, the Generation 3 car was still used in the Busch Series, until the series adopted their Generation 4 car in 1994.\n\n\n=== Busch Series ===\nIn 1982, NASCAR's then-new second-tier series (currently known as the NASCAR Xfinity Series) competitors began looking at alternatives from the 5-litre based (311 cu in (5.1 L) engines, as in short track racing there was a push for six-cylinder engines to save on costs, with some series allowing weight breaks.  One popular idea was to use 231\u2013275 cu in (3.8\u20134.5 L) six-cylinder engines; instead of Cup Series' 358 cu in (5.9 L) V-8s. In 1989, NASCAR changed rules requiring cars to use current body styles, similar to the Cup cars. However, the cars still used V6 engines. The cars gradually became similar to Cup cars.\n\n\n== Models ==\n\n\n=== General Motors ===\n\n \n\nBuick Regal: 1981\u20131985, 1988\u20131991\nBuick LeSabre: 1986\u20131987\nChevrolet Lumina: 1989\u20131991\nChevrolet Malibu: 1981-1982\nChevrolet Monte Carlo: 1981\u20131989\nOldsmobile Cutlass: 1981\u20131991\nOldsmobile Delta 88: 1986\u20131987\nPontiac Grand Prix: 1981-1991\nPontiac LeMans: 1981-1983\n\n\n=== Ford Motor Company ===\n\nFord Thunderbird: 1981\u20131991\n\n\n=== Chrysler Corporation ===\n\nChrysler Cordoba: 1980-1983\nDodge Mirada: 1981-1985\nImperial: 1981-1985\n\n\n== See also ==\nCup Series cars\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe 2001 Chevrolet Monte Carlo 400 with the Looney Tunes was the 28th stock car race of the 2001 NASCAR Winston Cup Series and the 44th iteration of the event. The race was held on Saturday, September 8, 2001, in Richmond, Virginia, at Richmond International Raceway, a 0.75 miles (1.21 km) D-shaped oval. The race took the scheduled 400 laps to complete. In a wild finish, Ricky Rudd, driving for Robert Yates Racing, would battle with Richard Childress Racing driver Kevin Harvick in the final laps of the race. Harvick would send Rudd up on the track with 17 to go, but Rudd was eventually able to save the car. Rudd would then later payback Harvick with 7 to go, moving Harvick to win his 22nd career NASCAR Winston Cup Series victory and his second and final victory of the season. The win was also Robert Yates Racing's 50th victory as an organization. To fill out the podium, Harvick would finish second, and Dale Earnhardt, Inc. driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. would finish third.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nRichmond International Raceway (RIR) is a 3/4-mile (1.2 km), D-shaped, asphalt race track located just outside Richmond, Virginia in Henrico County.

It began on February 11, 2001, at Daytona International Speedway and ended on November 23, 2001, at New Hampshire International Speedway. Jeff Gordon of Hendrick Motorsports was declared as the series champion for the fourth time in seven years.\nThe season was marred by a two-car collision at the end of the season-opening Daytona 500, which claimed the life of seven-time Series champion Dale Earnhardt. The accident resulted in safety upgrades being instituted. It also was the first year to have a unified television contract with Fox Sports, NBC Sports, and Turner Sports/TNT broadcasting the season's races; previous seasons saw each racetrack negotiate their own TV coverage, creating a patchwork of broadcast companies covering races throughout the season. Dodge returned to the sport for the first time since 1985 after DaimlerChrysler spent six years in the CART FedEx Championship Series via the Mercedes-Benz brand as an engine supplier.

However, in turns 3 and 4 on the final lap,  Earnhardt misjudged on blocking Sterling Marlin, who held his line on the inside lane, and got loose off of Marlin's right front fender. Earnhardt would over correct his car, shoot his car up in front of the field, collect Ken Schrader by making contact with Schrader's driver's side door, and both cars would  crash into the turn 4 wall. The angle of Earnhardt's car getting into Schrader made him crash into the wall head on.
