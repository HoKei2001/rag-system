{"page_content": "Monaco, officially the Principality of Monaco, is a sovereign city-state and microstate on the French Riviera a few kilometres west of the Italian region of Liguria, in Western Europe, on the Mediterranean Sea. It is a semi-enclave bordered by France to the north, east and west. The principality is home to 38,682 residents, of whom 9,486 are Mon\u00e9gasque nationals; it is recognised as one of the wealthiest and most expensive places in the world. The official language is French; Mon\u00e9gasque, English and Italian are spoken and understood by many residents.\nWith an area of 2.08 km2 (0.80 sq mi), Monaco is the second-smallest sovereign state in the world, after Vatican City. Its population of 38,367 in 2023 makes it the most densely populated sovereign state. Monaco has the world's shortest coastline: 3.83 km (2.38 mi). The principality is about 15 km (9.3 mi) from the border with Italy and consists of nine administrative wards, the largest of which is Monte Carlo.\nThe principality is governed under a form of constitutional monarchy, with Prince Albert II as head of state, who wields political power despite his constitutional status. The prime minister, who is the head of government, can be either a Mon\u00e9gasque or French citizen; the monarch consults with the Government of France before an appointment. Key members of the judiciary are detached French magistrates. The House of Grimaldi has ruled Monaco, with brief interruptions, since 1297. The state's sovereignty was officially recognised by the Franco-Mon\u00e9gasque Treaty of 1861, with Monaco becoming a full United Nations voting member in 1993. Despite Monaco's independence and separate foreign policy, its defence is the responsibility of France, besides maintenance of two small military units.\nMonaco's economic development was spurred in the late 19th century with the opening of the state's first casino, the Monte Carlo Casino, and a rail connection to Paris. Monaco's mild climate, scenery, and gambling facilities have contributed to its status as a tourist destination and recreation centre for the rich. Monaco has become a major banking centre and sought to diversify into the services sector and small, high-value-added, non-polluting industries. Monaco is a tax haven; it has no personal income tax (except for French citizens) and low business taxes. Over 30% of residents are millionaires, with real estate prices reaching \u20ac100,000 ($116,374) per square metre in 2018. Monaco is a global hub of money laundering, and in June 2024 the Financial Action Task Force placed Monaco under increased monitoring or a \u201cgrey list\u201d to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.\nMonaco is not part of the European Union (EU), but participates in certain EU policies, including customs and border controls. Through its relationship with France, Monaco uses the euro as its sole currency. Monaco joined the Council of Europe in 2004 and is a member of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (OIF). It hosts the annual motor race, the Monaco Grand Prix, one of the original Grands Prix of Formula One. The local motorsports association gives its name to the Monte Carlo Rally, hosted in January in the French Alps. The principality has a club football team, AS Monaco, which competes in French Ligue 1 and been French champions on multiple occasions, and a basketball team, which plays in the EuroLeague. A centre of research into marine conservation, Monaco is home to one of the world's first protected marine habitats, an Oceanographic Museum, and the International Atomic Energy Agency Marine Environment Laboratories, the only marine laboratory in the UN structure.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMonaco's name comes from the nearby 6th-century BC Phocaean Greek colony. Referred to by the Ligurians as Monoikos, from the Greek \"\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2\", \"single house\", from \"\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2\" (monos) \"alone, single\" + \"\u03bf\u1f36\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2\" (oikos) \"house\". According to an ancient myth, Hercules passed through the Monaco area and turned away the previous gods\nAssociation Sportive de Monaco Football Club, commonly referred to as AS Monaco (French pronunciation: [\u0251.\u025bs m\u0254nako]), is a professional football club based in Fontvieille, Monaco. Although not in France, they are a member of the French Football Federation (FFF) and currently compete in Ligue 1, the top tier of French football. Founded in 1918, the team play their home matches at the Stade Louis II.\nIts training center is situated in neighboring France, in la Turbie.\nDespite not being a French club, Monaco are one of the most successful clubs in French football, having won eight league titles, five Coupe de France trophies and one Coupe de la Ligue. The club also played in European football a number of times, and were runners-up in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1992 and the UEFA Champions League in 2004.\nThe club's traditional colours are red and white, and the club is known as Les Rouge et Blanc (lit.\u2009'The Red and Whites'). Monaco is a member of the European Club Association. In December 2011, two-thirds of the club was sold to an investment group led by Russian oligarch and billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev. With Rybolovlev's financial backing, the club quickly returned to Ligue 1 and won the 2016\u201317 Ligue 1, their first league title in 17 years.\n\n\n== Status ==\nUnlike several other European microstates, Monaco has never organized a domestic league and has never sought separate membership in either UEFA or FIFA. As a result, AS Monaco has no domestic league to play in its home country, resulting in it being expatriated into the French league system. AS Monaco is a full member of said French league pyramid, enabling it to represent France in European competitions. There are several other expatriated football clubs in operation around Europe, although AS Monaco is unique in that it represents a nation not a member of the international organizations. Although Vaduz among other Liechtenstein clubs play in the Swiss league system due to Liechtenstein not having a league, those clubs do have a domestic cup in their home country and qualify for European football that way. Two other microstates in Europe have or had teams playing abroad, Andorra and San Marino, although those clubs are separate from existing domestic league infrastructures.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nAS Monaco FC was founded on 1 August 1920 as a unification of numerous local clubs based in France and the principality. Then, the multiple sports club of the Association Sportive de Monaco was founded on 23 August 1924. AS Monaco FC was then absorbed by the latter and became the football section of the enlarged Monegasque sporting club.\nThe club's early years were spent in the amateur regional divisions of the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur region, rising rapidly between the leagues in the 1920s. In 1933, Monaco were invited by the French Football Federation to turn professional. The Mon\u00e9gasques' first year of second division football ended in failure, however, as they were relegated to the amateur leagues the following year. By 1948, Monaco re-acquired its professional status and returned to the French second division; they subsequently consistently finished in its upper echelons, with this sustained effort resulting in promotion to the French first division for the first time in 1953.\n\n\n=== 1960\u20131986: Domestic successes ===\n\nIn 1960, Monaco coach Lucien Leduc led the club to its first professional trophy, the Coupe de France, beating Saint-\u00c9tienne 4\u20132 in extra time. This initial success was bettered in the following year with the club winning the French Championship for the first time in its history, qualifying for the European Cup. Leduc subsequently led the club to its first League and Cup Double in 1963. Upon Leduc's departure in 1963, Monaco endured a barren run, entrenched in the middle half of the league for the best part of the next decade and alternating between the first and second divisions after 1963. In 1975, Jean-Louis Campora, son of former president\nKelly Marie Monaco (born May 23, 1976) is an American actress, model, and reality television personality, best known for her portrayal of Sam McCall on the ABC soap opera General Hospital and as the first season winner of the reality TV competition series Dancing with the Stars.  Monaco was also Playboy \"Playmate of the Month\" for April 1997, and portrayed Livvie Locke on the soap opera Port Charles from 2000 through 2003.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nKelly Monaco was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Albert \"Al\" and Carmina Monaco. She is the middle child and has four sisters. The family moved to the Poconos, where she attended Pocono Mountain High School and took her first acting classes. After high school she worked as a lifeguard at a local resort and attended Northampton Community College for two years.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early modeling ===\nIn 1996, Monaco, who had been thinking of a career in modeling, sent her photo to Playboy. As a result, she became the Playmate of the Month for April 1997. Throughout her tenure with Playboy in the 1990s, Monaco was also featured in many Playboy Special Edition publications.\n\n\n=== Acting and reality television ===\nMonaco's first television role was in the drama Baywatch from 1997 to 1998. In addition to playing the role of Susan on the show, she was also Carmen Electra's body double at times, as Electra could not swim. Monaco also had minor roles in the late 1990s films BASEketball, Idle Hands, and Mumford.\nMonaco had two roles in the ABC soap opera Port Charles as Olivia \"Livvie\" Locke Morley (1999\u20132003) and Tess Ramsey (2002\u201303). When that program ended, she joined the cast of the ABC soap opera General Hospital as Samantha McCall in October 2003.\nIn 2003, Monaco was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her role on Port Charles. In 2006, she was again nominated for a Daytime Emmy, this time for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her role as Sam McCall on General Hospital. In 2006, Monaco also co-hosted the 33rd Annual Daytime Emmys, with Dancing with the Stars host Tom Bergeron.\nIn March 2009, Monaco was chosen by Donald Trump and Paula Shugart to be one of the judges for the 2009 Miss USA pageant.\nMonaco starred on the E! reality television series Dirty Soap, which premiered on September 25, 2011.\nShe was a cast member, and the season winner along with her professional partner, Alec Mazo, on the ABC reality-television series Dancing with the Stars, during its first season in 2005. Although she initially faced tough criticism from the judges, she maintained a positive outlook throughout the series. Among the events she experienced before her victory was a wardrobe malfunction in which the skimpy strap on her dress came apart during a Latin dance number. Monaco remained the only female to win the competition until season 6 when Kristi Yamaguchi won.\nMonaco appeared in a Maxim cover feature in 2005, and the magazine also placed her at #13 on their annual Hot 100 List in 2006. \nIn February 2009, Monaco expanded her dancing r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with Peepshow, a burlesque act directed by Tony Award-winning director Jerry Mitchell, that plays at the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. Monaco starred as Bo Peep, a precocious character who discovers her sexuality throughout the show. Monaco starred alongside singer and fellow Dancing with the Stars contestant Melanie Brown, until June 2009, when Monaco's contract expired and she was replaced by Holly Madison. The same year, Monaco was named Maxim's number one sexiest cover model of the decade.\nOn July 27, 2012, it was announced that Monaco would be participating in the fifteenth season of Dancing with the Stars for a chance to win a second mirrorball trophy. This time she was partnered with Valentin Chmerkovskiy. After making the finals for a second time, Monaco finished in third place on November 27, 2012.\nIn November 2017, Monaco returned to twenty fifth season o\nGrace Patricia Kelly (November 12, 1929 \u2013 September 14, 1982), also known as Grace of Monaco, was an American actress and Princess of Monaco as the wife of Prince Rainier III from their marriage on April 18, 1956, until her death in 1982. Prior to her marriage, she achieved stardom in several significant Hollywood films in the early to mid-1950s. She received an Academy Award, three Golden Globe Awards and was ranked 13th on the American Film Institute's 25 Greatest Female Stars list.\nKelly was born into a prominent Catholic family in Philadelphia. After graduating from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1949, she began appearing in New York City theatrical productions and television broadcasts. Kelly made her film debut in Fourteen Hours (1951) and gained stardom from her roles in Fred Zinnemann's western film High Noon (1952), and John Ford's adventure-romance Mogambo (1953), the latter of which earned her the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination. She won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in the drama The Country Girl (1954). Other notable works include the war film The Bridges at Toko-Ri (1954), the romantic comedy High Society (1956), and three Alfred Hitchcock suspense thrillers: Dial M for Murder (1954), Rear Window (1954), and To Catch a Thief (1955).\nKelly retired from acting at age 26 to marry Rainier and began her duties as Princess of Monaco. Grace and Rainier had three children: Princess Caroline, Prince Albert, and Princess St\u00e9phanie. Princess Grace's charity work focused on young children and the arts. In 1964, she established the Princess Grace Foundation to support local artisans. Her organization for children's rights, AMADE Mondiale, gained consultive status within UNICEF and UNESCO. Her final film role was narrating The Children of Theatre Street (1977), which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.\nGrace died at the age of 52 at Monaco Hospital, from injuries sustained in a car crash. Her son, Prince Albert, helped establish the Princess Grace Awards in 1984 to recognize emerging performers in film, theatre, and dance.\n\n\n== Early life and family ==\n\nGrace Patricia Kelly was born on November 12, 1929, at Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to an affluent and influential family. Her father, John B. Kelly Sr., was born to Irish immigrants; he won three Olympic gold medals for sculling. He owned a successful brickwork contracting company that was well known on the East Coast. As the Democratic Party nominee in the 1935 election for mayor of Philadelphia, he lost by the closest margin in the city's history. In later years, he served on the Fairmount Park Commission and, during World War II, was appointed by President Roosevelt as National Director of Physical Fitness. His brother Walter C. Kelly was a vaudeville star, who also made films for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Paramount Pictures, and another brother named George was a Pulitzer Prize-winning dramatist, screenwriter, and director. He built the family home at 3901 Henry Ave in the East Falls, Philadelphia neighborhood. The Kelly's former family home went up for sale for $1 million in June 2016. It wound up selling in September 2016 for $775,000.\nKelly's mother, Margaret Majer, was of German ancestry. Margaret had taught physical education at the University of Pennsylvania and had been the first woman to coach women's athletics at Penn. She also modeled for a time in her youth. After marrying John Kelly in 1924, Margaret focused on being a homemaker until all her children were of school age, following which she began actively participating in various civic organizations. Patrilineally, Margaret descended from Prof. Johann Christian von Majer (1741\u20131821) from Ludwigsburg, who worked as a political scientist, jurist and theologian, and was elected five times Rector of the University of T\u00fcbingen. Through him, Grace was descended from the Stauffenberg family and many other \nPrincess St\u00e9phanie Marie Elisabeth of Monaco, Countess of Polignac (born 1 February 1965) is the youngest child of Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, and American actress Grace Kelly. She is the younger sister of Albert II, Prince of Monaco, and Caroline, Princess of Hanover. Currently 14th in the line of succession to the Monegasque throne, she has been a singer, swimwear designer and fashion model.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\n\nSt\u00e9phanie was born to Prince Rainier III and Princess Grace on 1 February 1965 at Prince's Palace in Monaco. She is the youngest of their three children. She has two older siblings, Caroline and Albert. Her godparents are her maternal uncle John B. Kelly Jr. and paternal first cousin Elisabeth-Anne de Massy. Her mother, who described Stephanie as a \"warm, bright, amusing, intelligent and capable girl\" and a \"good athlete\", lovingly called her \"wild child\" (French: enfant terrible).\nOn 13 September 1982, while returning home from their farm in Rocagel, France, St\u00e9phanie and her mother had a car accident. Grace died the next day, on 14 September, while St\u00e9phanie sustained a hairline fracture of a neck vertebra. \nAlthough the official report of the incident was that Grace suffered a stroke while driving, rumors began that St\u00e9phanie, who had to miss her mother's funeral due to her recovery, was the one actually driving. St\u00e9phanie herself refused to speak publicly about her mother's death until 1989, when she gave an interview to the author Jeffrey Robinson, insisting that the story was untrue. She said, \"There was a lot of pressure on me because everyone was saying that I had been driving the car, that it was all my fault, that I'd killed my mother... It's not easy when you're 17 to live with that.\" \nShe did not discuss the subject again until a 2002 interview with the French magazine Paris Match in which she repeated her earlier denial, and discussed the trauma of being beside her mother at the time of the accident. She said, \"Not only did I go through the horrible trauma of losing my mother at a very young age, but I was beside her at the moment of the accident. Nobody can imagine how much I've suffered, and still suffer.\"\nPrincess St\u00e9phanie was educated at the Dames de Saint-Maur in Monaco, and then at the \u00e9cole and coll\u00e8ge Dupanloup in Boulogne-Billancourt, France. St\u00e9phanie earned her baccalaur\u00e9at from the Cours Charles de Foucauld in 1982.  During her school years, she studied classical dance and piano, and  competed in gymnastics and horse riding. She also attended Camp Oneka, an all-girls' summer camp in the Pocono Mountains, in the United States, where her sister and mother both had previously attended.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nIn 1983, after her physical recovery from the accident that killed her mother, St\u00e9phanie started an apprentice programme at Christian Dior under the direction of head designer Marc Bohan. The following year, she debuted as a model on the biannual haute couture special published by Spanish magazine \u00a1Hola!, a venture that she repeated in 1990. In 1985, St\u00e9phanie appeared on the cover of German Vogue magazine and the American publication Vanity Fair. She also became the spokesman of the Swiss beauty line La Prairie, for which she was photographed by Horst, and she appeared on the cover of French Vogue, photographed by Helmut Newton in September 1986.\n\nIn 1986, St\u00e9phanie launched a swimwear line Pool Position with Alix de la Comble, whom she had met during her internship at Dior. The fashion show to present the line, held at the Sporting Club in Monaco and attended by her father, Prince Rainier, and siblings, Caroline and Albert, was a major event covered by the worldwide media. In 1989, St\u00e9phanie launched her own self-titled perfume.\nSt\u00e9phanie co-owns Replay cafes and stores in both Monaco and Barcelona. In December 2008, she was guest-editor of Vogue Paris and appeared on the magazine's cover.\n\n\n=== Musical career ===\n\nIn February 1986, St\u00e9phanie self-produced and re\nAS Monaco Basket, commonly referred to as AS Monaco or simply Monaco, is a French-registered Monaco-based professional basketball club. They are a part of the Monaco-based multi-sports club of A.S. Monaco, which was founded in 1924.\nThe club's basketball section was founded four years later in 1928, and it currently competes in the French top-tier level LNB Pro A and the EuroLeague. Monaco plays their home games at Salle Gaston M\u00e9decin.\nMonaco has won one EuroCup title in 2021, one French Cup in 2023, and three Leaders Cups.\n\n\n== History ==\nAbout four years after the parent athletic club, A.S. Monaco, was itself founded, A.S. Monaco Basket was founded in 1928. They finished as runners-up in the French top-tier level Nationale 1 (current LNB Pro A) following the 1950 season, which is regarded as one of their greatest successes in their history. Monaco also won the LNB Pro B (French 2nd Division) championship in the 1973 season, with one of the greatest offenses on the European continent.\nA.S. Monaco Basket joined the Nationale 1 for the 1973\u201374 season, where they finished in ninth place. They made their first appearance in the European 3rd-tier level FIBA Kora\u0107 Cup in the 1974\u201375 season, where they lost in the group stage to other notable teams, such as the French League club ASVEL Basket, the Bulgarian League club Levski Sofia, and the Italian League club AMG Sebastiani Basket. They entered the same tournament again in the 1982\u201383 season, but lost to Dynamo Moscow in the semifinals qualification battle, in the Top 16 group stage, despite a far better finish in the tournament overall.\nEntering the 1980s, Monaco was in the process of securing their title as one of the most dangerous teams in French basketball. They reached the finals game of the French Federation Cup, where they lost to Limoges CSP, by a score of 96\u201381. The Red and Whites also became a threat in the LNB Pro A (French 1st Division), what the league had been renamed to, after former NBA player, Robert Smith, joined the team in 1985. Smith was named the 1987 French League All-Star Game MVP.\nAfter Smith left the team, Monaco found themselves descending in the league. They were relegated to the second division LNB Pro B, later in the decade, and eventually ended up in the Nationale 1 Division. They would not return to the LNB Pro A, the highest division of basketball in France, for many years to come. In 2014, A.S. Monaco Basket was crowned the champions of the French third-tier league, the Nationale Masculine 1 (NM1), and they returned to the LNB Pro B (French 2nd Division).\nIn the 2014\u201315 season, Monaco became the French 2nd-tier LNB Pro B champions, and they were finally promoted back to the top-tier league in France, the LNB Pro A. In 2015, the Ukrainian businessman and philanthropist, Sergey Dyadechko, became the President of A.S. Monaco Basket. In the 2015\u201316 season, Monaco won the 2016 edition of the French Pro A League Cup, after beating \u00c9lan Chalon in the finals, by a score of 99\u201374. Monaco player, Jamal Shuler, was named the French Pro A Leaders Cup MVP.\nIn the 2016\u201317 season, Monaco returned to European-wide competitions, when it qualified for one of the pan-European secondary level competitions, the FIBA Basketball Champions League. They finished the season in third place. In 2017, the charity fund, DSF, founded by the club's owner, Dyadechko, became a sponsor of A.S. Monaco Basket. The club also played in the FIBA Champions League, during the 2017\u201318 season, in which they finished in second place, after they lost to the Greek League club AEK Athens in the final, by a score of 100\u201394. The club won the 2017 French Pro A League Cup and the 2018 French Pro A League Cup titles. They also finished in second place in the French Pro A League, in the 2017\u201318 season.\nIn European-wide competitions, Monaco spent the next three seasons (2018\u201319, 2019\u201320, and 2020\u201321) playing in the other pan-European secondary level competition, the EuroCup, subsequently winning it i\nAlbert II (Albert Alexandre Louis Pierre Grimaldi; born 14 March 1958) is Prince of Monaco, reigning since 2005.\nBorn at the Prince's Palace of Monaco, Albert is the second child and only son of Prince Rainier III and Princess Grace. He attended the Lyc\u00e9e Albert Premier before studying political science at Amherst College. In his youth, he competed in bobsleigh during Winter Olympic finals before retiring in 2002. Albert was appointed regent in March 2005 after his father fell ill, and became sovereign prince upon the latter's death a week later. Since his ascension, he has been outspoken in the field of environmentalism  and an advocate of ocean conservation, and adoption of renewable energy sources to tackle global climate change, and founded Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation in 2006, to directly raise funds and initiate action for such causes and greater ecological preservation.\nWith assets valued in 2010 at US$1 billion, Albert owns shares in the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Bains de Mer, which operates Monaco's casino and other entertainment properties in the principality. In July 2011, Prince Albert married South African Olympic swimmer Charlene Wittstock. He has four children: Jazmin, Alexandre, Gabriella, and Jacques.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nPrince Albert was born in the Prince's Palace of Monaco on 14 March 1958, as the second child of Prince Rainier III and Princess Grace. At the time of his birth, he was heir apparent to the throne. Albert was a dual citizen of both the Principality of Monaco and the United States of America by birth, before renouncing his American citizenship in his early adulthood. He was baptized on 20 April 1958, by Monsignor Jean Delay, Archbishop of Marseille, in the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception of Monaco. His godparents were Prince Louis de Polignac and Queen Victoria Eugenie of Spain.\n\n\n== Hereditary Prince ==\n\n\n=== Military service ===\nAlbert graduated with distinction from the Lyc\u00e9e Albert Premier, in 1976. He was a camper, and later a counselor for six summers at Camp Tecumseh, on Lake Winnipesaukee, Moultonborough, New Hampshire, in the 1970s. He spent a year training in princely duties before enrolling at Amherst College, in Massachusetts, in 1977 as Albert Grimaldi. He joined Chi Psi Fraternity and lived in the Alpha Chi Lodge. Albert spent mid-1979 touring Europe and the Middle East with the Amherst College Glee Club, and also undertook an exchange program with the University of Bristol, at the Alfred Marshall School of Economics and Management, in 1979. He graduated in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science. He speaks French, German, Italian, and English. From September 1981 to April 1982, Albert trained on board the French Navy's helicopter cruiser Jeanne d'Arc , attaining the rank of Ship-of-the-Line Ensign (2nd class), and is currently a reserve Lieutenant Commander. From 1983 to 1985, he took training courses with companies J.P. Morgan & Co, Louis Vuitton, Rogers & Wells, and Wells, Rich and Greene in the United States and Europe, studying financial management, communication, and marketing. Since May 1993, the Prince has led the Monegasque delegation to the General Assembly of the United Nations. In 2004, the Prince presided over the delegation of Monaco in Strasbourg, France, for the official accession of the Principality onto the Council of Europe.\nPrince Albert's mother, Princess Grace, died at age 52 as a result of injuries sustained in a car accident in 1982. In 2017, the Prince stated during an interview that his mother's death was a traumatic event for him and his family, revealing that his father was \"never the same man\" after the loss.\n\n\n=== Sports career ===\n\nAlbert was an enthusiastic sportsman, participating in cross country, javelin throwing, handball, judo, swimming, tennis, rowing, sailing, skiing, squash and fencing.  He became a judo black belt in 1985.\nAlbert competed in the bobsleigh at five consecutive Winter Olympics for Monaco, taking part in both\nThe following is a list of rulers of Monaco. Most belong to the House of Grimaldi; exceptions, which consist primarily of the principality's administrators under periods of foreign occupation, are noted.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe House of Grimaldi, descended from Otto Canella, a statesman from the Republic of Genoa, and taking their name from his son Grimaldo, were an ancient and prominent Guelphic Genoese family. Members of this family, in the course of the civil strife in Genoa between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, were banned from Genoa in 1271 and took refuge in Monaco.\nFran\u00e7ois Grimaldi seized the Rock of Monaco in 1297, starting the Grimaldi dynasty, under the Genoese sovereignty. The Grimaldis acquired Menton in 1346 and Roquebrune in 1355, enlarging their possessions. These two towns (some 95% of the country's territory) were eventually ceded to France by the Franco-Mon\u00e9gasque Treaty in 1861.\nThe Grimaldis used the title of Lord until 1612. Then, Lord Honor\u00e9 II started using the title of Prince, thereby becoming the first Prince of Monaco. Afterwards, Honor\u00e9 II secured recognition of his independent sovereignty from Spain in 1633, and then from France by the Treaty of P\u00e9ronne in 1641. Since then the area has remained under the control of the Grimaldi family to the present day, except when under French control from 24 February 1793 to 17 May 1814.\n\n\n== Rulers of Monaco ==\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nPrince of Monaco\nFamily tree of Monegasque monarchs\nHereditary Prince of Monaco\nList of Mon\u00e9gasque consorts\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBurke's Royal Families of the World, Vol. 1: Europe and Latin America.

Located on a headland that extends into the Mediterranean Sea, it is nicknamed The Rock (French: Le Rocher; Mon\u00e9gasque: A Roca). The name \"Monaco City\" is misleading: it is not itself a city, but a historical and statistical district. It holds most of the country's political and judicial institutions: the Prince's Palace, the town hall, the government, the National Council (parliament of Monaco), the Municipal Council, the courts and a prison (hanging on The Rock).\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMonaco City is one of the four traditional quarters (French: quartiers) of Monaco; the others are La Condamine, Monte Carlo, and Fontvieille. It is located at 43\u00b043\u203251\u2033N 7\u00b025\u203226\u2033E and has an estimated population of 975.  It has 19.64 hectares of surface and is located between the districts of Fontvieille and La Condamine.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMonaco Ville was originally called in Greek Monoikos, after the temple of Hercules Monoikos, located in a Phocaean colony of the 6th century BCE. During its history, Monoikos changed hands numerous times. It became Monaco in the Middle Ages. Some of the city walls and original structures still remain.\nIt was here that the Phocaeans of Massalia (now Marseille) founded the colony of Mono\u00efkos in the 6th century BC. Monoikos was associated with Hercules, who was worshipped as Hercules Monoecus. According to the works of Hercules, but also according to Diodorus of Sicily and Strabo, the Greeks and the Ligurians reported that Hercules had passed through the region.\nOn 10 June 1215, a detachment of Ghibellines led by Fulco del Cassello began the construction of a fortress on the rock of Monaco in order to make it a strategic military position and a means of controlling the area.\nThey also established dwellings at the base of the Rock to support the garrisons. To attract the inhabitants of Genoa and the surrounding towns, they offered land and exempted newcomers from taxes.\nOn January 8, 1297, Fran\u00e7ois Grimaldi, descendant of Otto Canella, consul of Genoa in 1133, took over the fortress. Although he had a small army, he disguised himself as a Franciscan friar to enter, before opening the gates to his soldiers. This episode gave rise to his nickname, Malizia (\"malice\"). This is why today the arms of Monaco bear two Franciscans armed with a sword.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\nDespite being located in the middle of the City of Monaco, the world's most densely populated urban center, Monaco City remains a medieval village at heart, made up almost entirely of quiet pedestrian streets and marked by virtual silence after sundown. Though innumerable people visit Monaco City and the palace square, only local vehicles are allowed up to the Rock, and gasoline-powered motorcycles are prohibited after 10 p.m.\n\nPrince's Palace of Monaco.

As the eldest child of Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, and Grace Kelly, she is the elder sister of Albert II, Prince of Monaco, and Princess St\u00e9phanie.\nShe was Hereditary Princess of Monaco and heir presumptive to the Monegasque throne from her birth in 1957 until her brother Albert was born the following year, and again from Albert's accession in 2005 until the birth of his twins, her niece Gabriella and nephew Jacques, in 2014.\n\n\n== Family and early life ==\nCaroline was born on 23 January 1957 in the Prince's Palace, Monaco. She is the eldest child of Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, and his wife, former American actress Grace Kelly. Christened Caroline Louise Marguerite, she belongs to the House of Grimaldi. She was the heiress presumptive from her birth to 14 March 1958, when her brother Prince Albert was born. On 1 February 1965, her younger sister Princess St\u00e9phanie was born. Caroline is a legitimate patrilineal descendant of the Dukes of Polignac, and as such belongs to the historical French nobility. Through her mother, she is of Irish and German descent.\nIn an interview for People in April 1982, shortly before her death, Grace described Caroline and St\u00e9phanie as \"warm, bright, amusing, intelligent and capable girls. They're very much in tune with their era. Besides being good students, they are good athletes \u2013 excellent skiers and swimmers. Both can cook and sew and play the piano and ride a horse. But, above all, my children are good sports, conscious of their position and considerate of others. They are sympathetic to the problems and concerns in the world today.\"\nAs a child, Caroline spent time at the home of her maternal grandparents, John B. Kelly, Sr. and Margaret Kelly (n\u00e9e, Majer), in Philadelphia. In addition to visiting her mother's family in the United States, she spent the summer of 1971 at Camp Oneka in the Poconos at the age of 14. While there, unbeknownst to her parents, Caroline was protected by the United States Secret Service.\nPrincess Grace died on 14 September 1982, the day after suffering a stroke while driving herself and Princess St\u00e9phanie home to Monaco from a visit to France, resulting in an accident in which both were injured.\n\n\n=== Education ===\nThe princess received her French baccalaur\u00e9at in 1974 with honours. She was also educated at St Mary's School Ascot. After a semester at Sciences Po, Caroline continued her studies at the Sorbonne University, where she received a diploma in philosophy and minors in psychology and biology. She is fluent in French, English, Spanish, German and Italian.\n\n\n== Activities ==\n\nIn 1979, Princess Caroline was appointed by her parents as the president of the Mon\u00e9gasque Committee for the International Year of the Child. Two years later, in 1981, Caroline founded Jeune J'\u00e9coute association. The association set up a 'youth hotline' where young people can talk about their problems on the telephone with qualified people trained in dealing problems young people faced. Other philanthropic organizations Caroline has been involved with include the World Association of Children's Friends (AMADE Mondiale), the Princess Grace Foundation, the Prince Pierre Foundation, and UNICEF.\nCaroline is the Patron of Peter Le Marchant Trust, an organization that operates canal boat trips for ill and disabled people. Her other patronages include the International School of Paris, Les Ballets de Monte Carlo, which she also founded, the Monte-Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra, the Association des Guides et Scouts de Monaco, the Monte Carlo Garden Club and The Spring Arts Festival. In 1992, she was appointed the president of the International Contemporary Art Prize.\nFollowing her mother's death in 1982, Caroline served as de facto first lady of Monaco until her brother married Charlene Wittstock in 2011. She regularly attends important social events in Monaco related to \nRainier III (Rainier Louis Henri Maxence Bertrand Grimaldi; 31 May 1923 \u2013 6 April 2005) was Prince of Monaco from 1949 to his death in 2005. Rainier ruled the Principality of Monaco for almost 56 years.\nRainier was born at the Prince's Palace of Monaco, the only son of Hereditary Princess Charlotte and Prince Pierre. During his reign, he was responsible for the transformation of Monaco's economy, shifting from its traditional casino gambling base to its current status as a tax haven and cultural destination. The Prince also coordinated the substantial reforms of Monaco's constitution, which limited the powers of sovereign rule.\nRainier married American film star Grace Kelly in 1956, which generated global media attention. They had three children: Caroline, Albert and St\u00e9phanie. Rainier died in April 2005 from complications relating to a lung infection as a result of frequent smoking; he was succeeded by his son, Albert II.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nRainier was born at Prince's Palace in Monaco, the first native-born prince since Honor\u00e9 IV in 1758. Rainier's mother, Charlotte, was the only child of Louis II, Prince of Monaco, and his lover, Marie Juliette Louvet; she was legitimised through formal adoption and subsequently named heiress presumptive to the throne of Monaco. Rainier's father, Count Pierre of Polignac, who was half-French and half-Mexican, adopted his wife's dynasty, Grimaldi, upon marriage and was made a Prince of Monaco by his father-in-law. Rainier had an older sister, Princess Antoinette, Baroness of Massy. His parents divorced in 1933.\nRainier's early education was conducted in England, at the public schools of Summerfields in St Leonards-on-Sea, Sussex, and after 1935 at Stowe School, in Buckinghamshire.  Rainier then attended the Institut Le Rosey in Rolle and Gstaad, Switzerland from 1939, before continuing to the University of Montpellier in France, where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1943, before studying at Sciences Po Paris in Paris.\nIn 1944, the day before his 21st birthday, Rainier's mother renounced her right to the Monegasque throne and Rainier became Prince Louis's direct heir. In World War II, Rainier joined the Free French Army in September 1944, and served under General Joseph de Goislard de Monsabert as a second lieutenant. As soldier, he witnessed action during the German counter-offensive in Alsace. Rainier received the French Croix de Guerre with bronze star (representing a brigade level citation) and was given the rank of Legion of Honor in 1947. Following his decommission from the French Army, he was promoted by the French government as a captain in April 1949 and a colonel in December 1954.\nRainier became the Sovereign Prince of Monaco upon the death of his maternal grandfather, Prince Louis II, on 9 May 1949, at the age of 25.\n\n\n== Reign ==\n\nAfter ascending the throne, Rainier III worked to recoup Monaco's lustre, which had become tarnished through financial neglect and scandal (his mother, Princess Charlotte, took a noted jewel thief known as Ren\u00e9 the Cane as her lover). Upon ascension, the Prince found a treasury that was practically empty. Monaco's traditional gambling clientele, largely European aristocrats, found themselves with reduced funds after World War II. Other successful gambling centres had opened to compete with Monaco. To compensate for the loss of income, Rainier decided to promote Monaco as a tax haven, commercial centre, real-estate development opportunity, and international tourist attraction. The early years of his reign saw the overweening involvement of the Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis, who took control of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Bains de Mer and envisioned Monaco as solely a gambling resort. Prince Rainier regained control of SBM in 1964, effectively ensuring that his vision of Monaco would be implemented.\nDuring his reign, the Societ\u00e9 Mon\u00e9gasque de Banques et de M\u00e9taux Pr\u00e9cieux, a bank which held a significant amount of Monaco's capital, was bankrupted by\nCharlene (French: Charl\u00e8ne [\u0283a\u0281l\u025bn]; born Charlene Lynette Wittstock, 25 January 1978) is Princess of Monaco as the wife of Prince Albert II. Before her marriage, Charlene was an Olympic swimmer representing South Africa.\nCharlene was born in Bulawayo, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). She relocated to South Africa in 1989. She began her swimming career in 1996 (winning the South African Championship) and represented South Africa at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, with her team finishing fifth in the 4 \u00d7 100-metre medley relay. Charlene retired from professional swimming in 2007.\nCharlene met Prince Albert at the Mare Nostrum swimming competition in Monte Carlo, Monaco, in 2000. The couple married on 1 July 2011. On 10 December 2014, she gave birth to twins Princess Gabriella and Hereditary Prince Jacques. Princess Charlene's charity work primarily revolves around sports, AIDS, and underprivileged children. Charlene founded the Princess Charlene of Monaco Foundation in 2012 to support her personal humanitarian endeavours.\n\n\n== Early life and family ==\nCharlene Lynette Wittstock was born on 25 January 1978 at Mater Dei Hospital in Bulawayo, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), to Michael Kenneth Wittstock (b. 1946), a sales manager, and Lynette, n\u00e9e Humberstone (b. 1959), a former competitive diver and swimming coach. The Wittstock family is of German origin; Wittstock's great-great-grandparents Martin Gottlieb Wittstock (1840\u20131915) and his wife Johanne Luise Wittstock (n\u00e9e Sch\u00f6nknecht; 1850\u20131932) emigrated to South Africa from the Pomeranian village of Zerrenthin in northern Germany in 1861 to escape hardship. In South Africa, the Wittstocks worked as handyworkers and unsuccessfully prospected for diamonds. In 2014, she was given a certificate that verified her Irish ancestry.\nWittstock has two younger brothers: Gareth, a coffeehouse businessman in Monaco, and Sean, a promotions and events businessman in South Africa. The family relocated to South Africa in 1989, when Wittstock was 12 years old. She attended Tom Newby Primary school in Benoni, near Johannesburg, from 1988 to 1991.\n\n\n== Swimming career ==\nWittstock won three gold medals and a silver medal at the 1999 All-Africa Games in Johannesburg. She represented South Africa at the 1998 and 2002 Commonwealth Games, winning a silver medal in the 4 \u00d7 100 m medley relay in the latter competition. She also was a member of the South African women's 4\u00d7100 m medley team at the 2000 Summer Olympics, which finished fifth. Wittstock finished sixth at the 2002 FINA Short Course World Championships for the 200 m breaststroke. Throughout her career, Wittstock gave swimming lessons to underprivileged children. She left her Durban-based team (the Seagulls) to join the Tuks Swimming Club at the High Performance Centre of the University of Pretoria. However, she never enrolled in classes. The Club sponsored her by providing her with free access to their pools, free coaching, accommodation, and gymnasium access.\nWittstock decided to leave Pretoria in January 2005, and returned to Durban; she then went to the north coast of KwaZulu-Natal, where she joined a former University of Pretoria swimming coach, Branislav Ivkovic. On 13 April 2007, Wittstock regained her title as South Africa's 50-metre women's backstroke champion when she completed the 50 m backstroke final at the Telkom SA National Aquatic Championships in 30:16 seconds, to finish third behind Australia's Sophie Edington and Brazil's Fab\u00edola Molina. She planned to compete in the 2008 Summer Olympics in China as her swansong, but did not qualify. Previously, Wittstock had been out of competitive swimming for 18 months with a shoulder injury.\n\n\n== Marriage ==\n\nWittstock met Albert II, Prince of Monaco, in 2000 at the Mare Nostrum swimming meet in Monaco. They made their public debut as a couple at the opening ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics. She accompanied him to the weddings of the Crown Princess of Sweden in 2010 and of the Prince of Wales in 2011.\n\nOn 2\nThe early history of Monaco is primarily concerned with the protective and strategic value of the Rock of Monaco, the area's chief geological landmark, which served first as a shelter for ancient peoples and later as a fortress. Part of Liguria's history since the fall of the Roman Empire, from the 14th to the early 15th century the area was contested for primarily political reasons. Since that point, excepting a brief period of French occupation, it has remained steadily under the control of the House of Grimaldi. \nThe early history of Monaco as a state, has its origins the Kingdom of Genoa. The Holy Roman Empire granted Monaco to the Genoese. Later, the Grimaldi family which were a Genoese family, occupied it in the 13th century and later purchased it and ruled it as principality. Over its history it has had differing levels of autonomy from a parent state, which at times included Kingdom of Genoa, Crown of Aragon, Spain, and France over the centuries. It was incorporated into France in the French revolution, but later regained some autonomy as a protectorate of the Kingdom Sardinia in the 19th Century. In the 1848 two towns ceded and these were lost to France in 1861, but Monaco was not incorporated into France or Italy. It focused on tourism starting in the 1860s and was taken over by Axis powers in WW2. After liberation, it worked to secure further independence from France, and was recognized by the UN in 1993. It has relations with, but is not a part of the European Union but does use the Euro currency in the 21st century.\n\n\n== Early history and Ligurian settlement ==\n\nGrimaldi man lived here about 30,000 years ago.\nAccording to the accounts of historian Diodorus Siculus and geographer Strabo, the area's first permanent settlers were the mountain-dwelling Ligures, who emigrated from their native city of Genoa, in what is now northern Italy. However, the ancient Ligurian language is not directly connected to the Gallo-Italic language spoken by the modern inhabitants of Liguria, of which Monegasque is a dialect.\n\n\n== Phoenician colonization and Melqart ==\n\"According to some authorities, the Egyptians of the Eighteenth Dynasty, according to others, the early Phoenicians were the first commercial navigators,\" who found refuge in the Port of Monaco from the mistral of the sea. The Port and Rock of Monaco were consecrated by the Phoenicians in the name of their deity Melqart. The colony was called Monoike. After the Phoenicians, the Greeks wrote about the progress and conquests of the journeys and labors of Heracles. The native Ligurian people asserted that Hercules passed through the area.\n\n\n== Greek colonization and Herculean legend ==\nDuring the 6th-century BC, Phocaeans from Massalia (modern day Marseille) founded the colony of Monoikos. The name of the colony derives from the local veneration of the Greek demigod Heracles, also later adopted by the Romans, who was said to have constructed the ancient path that passed through the region from Spain to Italy. The Roman emperor Julian also wrote of Hercules's construction of Monaco's port and a coastal road. The road was dotted with altars to Heracles, and a temple dedicated to him was established on the Rock of Monaco. The name Port Hercules was subsequently used for the ancient port. Monoeci meaning \"Single One\" or Monoikos meaning \"Single House\" could be a reference to Hercules or his temple, or the isolated community inhabiting the area around the rock.\nAccording to the \"travels of Heracles\" theme, also documented by Diodorus Siculus and Strabo, both Greeks and native Ligurian people asserted that Hercules passed through the area.\n\n\n== Roman rule ==\n\nAfter the Gallic Wars, Monoecus, which served as a stopping-point for Julius Caesar on his way to campaign in Greece,  fell under Roman control as part of the Maritime Alps province (Gallia Transalpina).\nThe Roman poet Virgil called it \"that castled cliff, Monoecus by the sea\".

The present bicolour design was adopted on 4 April 1881, under Charles III.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nMonaco's original flag, which was similar to its current princely flag but bore an older version of its coat of arms, was in use from the principality's early days (except during its annexation to France from 1793 to 1814) until the present, simpler design was adopted in 1881.\nAnother design (below), the banner of the state arms (lozenges in the Grimaldi family colours, in heraldic terms \"lozengy argent and gules\"), was used at various times, particularly in the 17th century, as an unofficial flag and still appears in some royal photographs. However, it has no designated use and does not represent any Monegasque official in particular.\nThe flag of Monaco is graphically similar to the flag of Indonesia, with differences in their dimension ratios (Monaco's at 4:5 and Indonesia's at 2:3), and the shade of red is darker for the flag of Monaco. The flag of Poland is also similar to that of Monaco, but with the colours reversed \u2013 white on top and red on the bottom. The flag of Singapore also has a similar design and colour, with the exception being a crescent with five stars at the upper left side.\n\n\n== Princely flag ==\nMonaco's princely flag (or government flag) consists of the full achievement of the coat of arms on a white background. It is flown at the Prince's palace, government offices, in the presence of government officials, and as an ensign on the Prince's yacht.\n\n\n== Personal standard of Albert II ==\n\nThe personal standard of Prince Albert II consists of the Crown of Monaco over two opposing letters A, on a white background. It is only used in his immediate presence, particularly on cars in which he travels. It is often seen with a gold fringe on the top, bottom and right, which is one-ninth the height of the white field.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Monaco flags\n\n\n== Notes ==\nSources disagree as to the flag's usage.

Informally, the name also refers to a larger district, the Monte Carlo Quarter (corresponding to the former municipality of Monte Carlo), which besides Monte Carlo/Sp\u00e9lugues also includes the wards of La Rousse/Saint Roman, Larvotto/Bas Moulins and Saint Michel. The permanent population of the ward of Monte Carlo is about 3,500, while that of the quarter is about 15,000. Monaco has four traditional quarters. From west to east they are: Fontvieille (the newest), Monaco-Ville (the oldest), La Condamine, and Monte Carlo.\nMonte Carlo is situated on a prominent escarpment at the base of the Maritime Alps along the French Riviera. Near the quarter's western end is the \"world-famous Place du Casino, the gambling center ... that has made Monte Carlo an international byword for the extravagant display and reckless dispersal of wealth\". It is also the location of the H\u00f4tel de Paris, Caf\u00e9 de Paris and Salle Garnier (the casino theatre which is the home of the Op\u00e9ra de Monte-Carlo). The quarter's eastern part includes the community of Larvotto with Monaco's only public beach, as well as its new convention center (the Grimaldi Forum), and the Monte-Carlo Bay Hotel & Resort. At the quarter's eastern border, one crosses into the French town of Beausoleil (sometimes referred to as Monte-Carlo-Sup\u00e9rieur), and 8 kilometres (5 mi) to its east is the western border of Italy.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1856, Charles III of Monaco granted a concession to Napoleon Langlois and Albert Aubert, to establish a sea-bathing facility for the treatment of various diseases, and to build a German-style casino.\n\nThe initial casino opened in La Condamine in 1862, but was unsuccessful.  It relocated several times, before reaching its present location in the \"Les Sp\u00e9lugues\" (The Caves) area of Monte Carlo.  Success came slowly, largely because Monaco was inaccessible from much of Europe. The railway, installed in 1868, brought with it an influx of people, and Monte Carlo grew in wealth.\nSaint-Charles Church on Monte Carlo's Avenue Sainte-Charles was completed in 1883. It was restored in its centenary year.\nThe municipality of Monte Carlo was created in 1911, when the constitution divided the principality of Monaco into three municipalities. Monte Carlo encompassed the existing neighborhoods of La Rousse/Saint Roman, Larvotto/Bas Moulins, and Saint Michel. The municipalities merged in 1917, after accusations that the government used them to \"divide and conquer\".  Since then, they became wards. Today, Monaco is divided into 9 wards, which are grouped into 4 quartiers.\nThe quarter of Monte Carlo was served by tramways from 1898 to 1931. It linked all parts of Monaco (see transportation in Monaco). In 2003 a new cruise ship pier was completed in the harbour at Monte Carlo.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMonte Carlo has an area of 28.14 hectares (or 0.28 square kilometers) and faces the Mediterranean Sea, bordered to the west by Ravin de Sainte-D\u00e9vote and La Condamine, and to the east by La Rousse and Larvotto.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMonte Carlo has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa), which is influenced by oceanic climate and humid subtropical climate. As a result, it has warm, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. \n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nMonte Carlo is home to an ATP Masters 1000 tennis tournament during the clay court season usually played during the end of March through mid to late April. Monte Carlo is a popular tax haven for many tennis professionals and home to many active and retired athletes. \nMonte Carlo is host to most of the Circuit de Monaco, on which the Formula One Monaco Grand Prix takes place. I\nThe sovereign prince (French: prince de Monaco) is the monarch and head of state of the Principality of Monaco. All reigning princes and princesses have taken the name of the House of Grimaldi. When Prince Rainier III died in 2005, he was Europe's longest reigning monarch. The Grimaldi family, which has ruled Monaco for eight centuries, is Europe's longest-ruling royal family.\nThe reigning prince is Albert II, who ascended in April 2005.\n\n\n== Powers of the prince ==\nMonaco, along with Liechtenstein and Vatican City, is one of only three states in Western Europe where the monarch still plays an active role in day-to-day politics.\nThe Prince of Monaco exercises his authority in accordance with the Constitution and laws. He represents the principality in foreign relations, and any revision, either total or partial, of the Constitution must be jointly agreed to by the monarch and the National Council.\nLegislative power is divided between the Prince who initiates the laws, and the National Council which votes on them. Executive power is retained by the monarch, who has veto power over all legislation proposed by the National Council.\nThe minister of state and the Government Council are directly responsible to the Prince for the administration of the principality.\nJudiciary powers also belong to the monarch. The present Constitution states that the prince has full authority in the courts and tribunals which render justice in his or her name.\nPursuant to Article 16 of the 1962 Constitution, the Prince confers orders, titles and other distinctions (see Awards and decorations of Monaco) as the fons honorum of the Principality of Monaco.\nIn 2005, The New York Times reported that loyalty to the princely family is fierce; few residents of Monaco want to be quoted saying anything negative about the monarchy.\n\n\n== Compensation ==\nThe princely family receives annual allocation from the budget of Monaco, \u20ac43.5 million in 2015.\n\n\n== Titles and styles ==\nThe Prince is styled His Serene Highness. Although used only formally, the Prince also bears several other hereditary titles, some of which are occasionally bestowed on his relatives or their spouses. Some of these titles have merged with the Crown of Monaco as a result of the Grimaldi family's acquisition of various fiefs; they no longer imply ownership or territorial authority, although the princes of Monaco have long been substantial owners of land and chateaux in France. Most were granted or recognised by the Kingdom of France or the Papal States and could only pass through the male line; they therefore became extinct as French dignities on the death of Albert's great-grandfather Prince Louis II in 1949. Thereafter, some of these titles were implicitly re-created as distinctly Monegasque titles.\nThe Prince's complete titles and styles are, in precedent order of rank:\n\nSovereign Prince of Monaco\nDuke of Valentinois\nDuke of Estouteville\nDuke of Mazarin\nDuke of Mayenne\nPrince of Ch\u00e2teau-Porcien\nMarquis of Baux (Title now used by Hereditary Prince Jacques)\nMarquis of Chilly-Mazarin\nMarquis of Guiscard\nMarquis of Bailli\nCount of Polignac\nCount of Carlad\u00e8s (Title now used by Princess Gabriella)\nCount of Ferrette, Belfort, Thann and Rosemont\nCount of Torigni\nCount of Longjumeau\nCount of Cl\u00e8des\nBaron of Calvinet\nBaron of Buis\nBaron of La Luthumi\u00e8re\nBaron of Hambye\nBaron of Altkirch\nBaron of Saint-L\u00f4\nBaron of Massy (Title now used by Christian Louis de Massy, son of Princess Antoinette)\nSeigneur (Lord) of Issenheim\nSeigneur of Saint-R\u00e9my\nSire of Matignon\nAll palace correspondence features capitalized pronouns when referring to the prince.\nThe tradition of the monarchy of Monaco was that the flag flying from the staff on the tower above his office be hoisted when the prince was present in Monaco. The current prince flies the flag whether he is present or not, preferring to keep his location private.\nMonaco is officially protected by France, according to terms set forth in the Treaty of Versailles in \nJacques, Hereditary Prince of Monaco, Marquis of Baux (Jacques Honor\u00e9 Rainier Grimaldi; born 10 December 2014), is the heir apparent to the Monegasque throne. He is the son of Prince Albert II and Princess Charlene, and twin brother of Princess Gabriella.\nHe also holds the title of Marquis of Baux, which all the heirs apparent to the crown of Monaco have held since 1643.\n\n\n== Birth and christening ==\nOn 30 May 2014, it was announced that Princess Charlene was pregnant. After much speculation, it was confirmed, on 9 October 2014, that the couple was expecting twins by the end of the year. On 21 November 2014, the palace announced that each twin would have the right to a salvo of 21 cannon shots at birth from the Fort Antoine. In addition, church bells were to ring for fifteen minutes, followed by boat horns. The day would be declared a holiday. On 10 December 2014, Jacques was born at Monaco's Princess Grace Hospital Centre, two minutes after his sister Gabriella. Princess Charlene revealed that she chose the name Jacques, a name that is common in her homeland. The names Honor\u00e9 and Rainier are common among previous rulers of Monaco. He received the title Marquis of Baux from his father. The twins were presented on 7 January 2015 which was declared a public holiday in Monaco. \nJacques and Gabriella were baptised at the Cathedral of Our Lady Immaculate in Monaco-Ville on 10 May 2015. His godparents are his distant cousins Christopher Le Vine Jr. and Diane de Polignac Nigra. At this occasion, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Grimaldi. A certified copy of this legal document is safeguarded in the Monaco cathedral, while another is at Bank of Monaco\u2014Credit Suisse.\n\n\n== Education ==\nJacques and his sister Gabriella attended Fran\u00e7ois d'Assise-Nicolas Barr\u00e9 School since 2021.\n\n\n== Titles and honours ==\n\n Monaco:\n Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Grimaldi (10 May 2015).\nWhen referring to Jacques in French, the palace has used the term Prince H\u00e9r\u00e9ditaire to refer to the prince. However, when mentioning the prince in English, the palace has referred to Jacques as \"Crown Prince\" instead of \"Hereditary Prince.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of current heirs apparent\n\n\n== References ==\nThe Dodge Monaco is an automobile that was marketed by the Dodge division of Chrysler Corporation. Introduced as the flagship of the Dodge product line, the Monaco was introduced for the 1965 model year to replace the Custom 880, then later joined as a sub-model of the Dodge Polara. During its production, the Monaco was offered in several body configurations, including two-door and four-door hardtop sedans, four-door sedans, two-door convertibles, and station wagons.\nFrom 1965 to 1977, three generations of the Monaco were produced with the full-size Chrysler C platform. For 1977 and 1978, Dodge shifted the Monaco to the intermediate Chrysler B platform, effectively downsizing the model line. For 1979, the model line was redesigned and renamed the Dodge St. Regis.\nAfter a 12-year hiatus, the full-size Monaco was revived for the 1990 model year as the flagship Dodge sedan, replacing the Diplomat. This was a rebadged version of the Eagle Premier which was developed by Renault and American Motors Corporation (AMC). The Monaco was replaced by the Dodge Intrepid for the 1993 model year.\nIt is named after the Principality of Monaco.\n\n\n== First generation (1965\u20131968) ==\n\n\n=== 1965 ===\nUpon its introduction on September 25, 1964, for the 1965 model year, the Dodge Monaco was intended to compete with the Pontiac Grand Prix in what came to be known as the personal luxury market, but ended up filling in for Dodge in the full-size, luxury line instead.\nThe 1965 Monaco was based on the Custom 880 two-door hardtop body. The Monaco received special badging, different taillight and grille treatment, and a sportier interior with a full-length center console, as well as a 383 cu in (6.28 L) 325 hp (242 kW) V8 engine as standard equipment. Larger, more powerful engines were also available as options. The Monaco competed with the Ford LTD, a top-of-the-line model in the Galaxie 500 series, the Caprice package for the Impala Sport sedan, as well as the 1966 Plymouth VIP model for its Fury series and the Ambassador DPL offered by American Motors. These models provided competition for mid-priced sedans like Chrysler, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Mercury.\nIn Canada, a version of the Plymouth Sport Fury was marketed as the Dodge Monaco. It was available in hardtop coupe or convertible body styles. The Canadian Monacos were equipped with Plymouth dashboards in 1965 and 1966. Unlike the U.S. Monaco versions, the Canadian Monacos were available with 318 cu in (5.21 L) V8s or the slant six.\n\n\n=== 1966 ===\nFor the 1966 model year, in the U.S., the Monaco replaced the Custom 880 series, and the former Monaco became the Monaco 500. The basic Monaco was available in hardtop coupe, four-door (pillarless) hardtop sedan, conventional four-door (pillared) sedan, and four-door station wagon body styles. In the U.S., the Monaco 500 was available only as a two-door hardtop. Although there was no convertible in the 1966 U.S. Monaco range, there was in the 1966 Canadian Monaco lineup. The Canadian Dodge used the \"Monaco\" name for the Sport Fury equivalent and the Polara 880 for the Fury III competitor.\n\n\n=== 1967 ===\nThe 1967 model year full-sized Dodges, the Monaco included, received significant facelifts with all-new exterior sheet metal. Chief designer Elwood Engel's work featured generally flat body planes with sharp-edged accent lines. The hardtop coupes featured new semi-fastback rooflines with reverse-slanted trailing edges on the rear quarter windows.\nIn Canada, the \"Monaco\" name was applied for 1967 to all of the premium full-sized Dodge cars, replacing the Polara 880 at the top of the Dodge line. Taking the Monaco's place as a premium full-size model was the Monaco 500, which was available only as a two-door hardtop and convertible.\n\n\n=== 1968 ===\nMarker lights in the fenders and full-width tail lights were added. The Monaco 500 was dropped at the end of the 1968 model year in the United States and at the end of the 1970 model year in Canada.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nCircuit de Monaco is a 3.337 km (2.074 mi) street circuit laid out on the city streets of Monte Carlo and La Condamine around the harbour of the Principality of Monaco. It is commonly, and even officially, referred to as \"Monte Carlo\" because it is largely inside the Monte Carlo neighbourhood of Monaco.\nThe circuit is annually used on three weekends in April\u2013May for Formula One Monaco Grand Prix, Formula E Monaco ePrix and Historic Grand Prix of Monaco. Formula One's respective feeder series over the years \u2013 Formula 3000, GP2 Series and today the Formula 2 and FIA Formula 3 championships and Porsche Supercup \u2013 also visit the circuit concurrently with Formula One. The Monaco Grand Prix is one of the three events victories in which count towards the Triple Crown of Motorsport.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe idea for a Grand Prix race around the streets of Monaco came from Antony Nogh\u00e8s, the president of the Monegasque motor club, Automobile Club de Monaco, and close friend of the ruling Grimaldi family. The inaugural race was held in 1929 and was won by William Grover-Williams in a Bugatti.\nTo date, only four local drivers have won a race at the circuit. Louis Chiron did it at the non-championship 1931 Monaco Grand Prix; 82 years later, Stefano Coletti crossed the line in first position at the sprint race of the 2013 Monaco GP2 Series round. The third driver to do so was St\u00e9phane Richelmi at the sprint race of the 2014 Monaco GP2 Series round. The fourth was Charles Leclerc at the 2024 Monaco Grand Prix.\n\n\n== Evolution of the circuit ==\nThe track has remained substantially unchanged since its creation in 1929: as a city circuit, its conformation is closely linked to that of the principality's road system. The changes were almost entirely connected to redefinitions of the ordinary roads of the town.\nIn the first editions of the Grand Prix, the start and finish were placed on Boulevard Albert 1er (the innermost straight, which leads to the Sainte D\u00e9vote curve). In 1955 the start and finish were moved to the opposite straight, overlooking the promenade (that now houses the pit lane). At the time, neither the Piscine complex nor the \"La Rascasse\" hairpin existed: after the \"Tabac\" curve, the route proceeded in the lane that is parallel to today's starting straight: the two sections (separated only by a row of trees) were joined by a single narrow hairpin called the \"Gasometer\". As can be seen from the period films, in the second half of the 1950s the only existing lane after the Tabac was the one mentioned; in fact, in those years, the lane that we now call \"promenade\" with the two \"Piscine\" chicanes was not yet defined, and only in the 1960s images we can notice the progress of the landfilling about that portion of the bay, including the Piscine area which would be completed shortly thereafter.\nIn 1963 the starting line was moved back to Boulevard Albert 1er (opposite the promenade). The swimming pool and the waterfront lane that 10 years later would become part of the circuit had already been created, but at that point in time no changes were made to the track from the \"Tabac\" to the \"Gasometer\".\nIn 1972 the boxes were moved near the \"Chicane\" area of the port, so the chicane was relocated closer to the \"Tabac\" curve. After this, the track continued on the usual straight (parallel to the starting lane) using the \"Gasometer\" curve for the last time. This solution lasted only a year and, in the following months, the main works were completed in time for the 1973 Grand Prix with the construction of a new section, connecting the \"Tabac\" curve to \"Piscine\" (Stade Nautique). This change added 0.133 km (0.083 mi) to the circuit \u2013 bringing its total length to 3.278 km (2.037 mi) \u2013 adding the new portion along the harbour, which followed the layout of the swimming pool and ended in a new chicane around the \"La Rascasse\" restaurant and a slight climb to the \"Anthony Noghes Curve\" before rejoining the starting straight. The boxes were reinstalled in t\nThe economy of Monaco is reliant on tourism and banking. Monaco, situated on the French coast of the Mediterranean Sea, is a popular resort, attracting tourists to its casino and pleasant climate.\nThe Principality has successfully sought to diversify into services and small, high-value-added, nonpolluting industries. The state has no income tax and low business taxes and thrives as a tax haven both for individuals who have established residence and for foreign companies that have set up businesses and offices. The state retains monopolies in a number of sectors, including gambling, tobacco, the telephone network, and the postal service.\n\n\n== Background ==\nEconomic development was spurred in the late 19th century with the opening of the rail link to France and the Monte Carlo Casino. Monaco's economy is now primarily geared toward finance, services, and real estate.\n\n\n== Modern times ==\nLow taxes have drawn many foreign individuals to Monaco and account for around 75% of the $7.78  billion annual GDP income in (2021). Similarly, tourism accounts for close to 15% of the annual revenue, as the Principality of Monaco also has been a major center for tourism ever since the famed Monte Carlo Casino was established in 1856. \nFinancial and insurance activities, along with scientific, support-administrative, activities are the main contributors to the GDP of Monaco. Wholesale trades (10%), construction (9.1%) and real estate activities (7.8%) also contribute highly to the country's GDP. Monaco real estate is known to be one of the most expensive in the world.  Banking sector of Monaco is rather large: in 2015 consolidated banking assets 8.42 times exceeded the country's GDP. Banks operating in Monaco traditionally specialize in private banking, asset and wealth management services. Wholesale trade, construction and real estate sectors come afterward in the ranking.\nAn economic and customs union with France governs customs, postal services, telecommunications, and banking in Monaco. Before the euro, Monaco used the Monegasque franc, which itself was pegged to the French franc. Now part of the Eurozone, but not the EU, Monaco mints its own euro coins.\nAll residents pay tax in the form of 20% value-added tax on all goods and services.\nMonaco is noted for its activity in the field of marine sciences. Its Oceanographic Museum, formerly directed by Jacques-Yves Cousteau, is one of the most renowned institutions of its kind in the world. Monaco import and exports products and services from all over the world. There is no commercial agriculture in Monaco; it is 100% urban.\n\n\n== Tax haven ==\nMonaco levies no income tax on individuals. The absence of a personal income tax in the principality has attracted to it a considerable number of wealthy \"tax refugee\" residents from European countries who derive the majority of their income from activity outside Monaco; celebrities such as Formula One drivers attract most of the attention, but the vast majority of them are less well-known business people.\nIn 2000, a report by the French parliamentarians, Arnaud Montebourg and Vincent Peillon, alleged that Monaco had lax policies with respect to money laundering, including within its famed casino, and that the government of Monaco had been placing political pressure on the judiciary so that alleged crimes were not properly investigated.\nIn 1998, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) issued a first report on the consequences of the tax havens' financial systems. Monaco did not appear in the list of these territories until 2004, when OECD became indignant regarding the Monegasque situation and denounced it in its last report, as well as Andorra, Liechtenstein, Liberia and the Marshall Islands, underlining its lack of co-operation as regards to financial information disclosure and availability.\nIn 2000, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) stated: \"The anti-money laundering system in Monaco is comprehensive.

Monaco is also the alternate television play-by-play voice for the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB) on the New England Sports Network (NESN).\n\n\n== Personal life and education ==\nA native of Cohasset, Massachusetts, Monaco was a three-sport athlete at Cohasset High School. He attended the University of Notre Dame and wrote for the school's student newspaper with the intent to become a Major League Baseball general manager, similar to the path former Red Sox general manager Theo Epstein had when he attended Yale. Monaco eventually transitioned to the school radio station at Notre Dame and subsequently began his broadcasting career.\nMonaco currently resides in Chicago.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMonaco interned at NESN in 2012 while at Notre Dame, before broadcasting Fighting Irish sporting events. In 2013 and 2014, he called games for the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He also called Western Michigan Broncos basketball games while at Notre Dame before interning with the Red Sox's Triple-A affiliate Pawtucket Red Sox as a radio broadcaster in 2017.\nMonaco joined ESPN in 2019 after two years working with Fox Sports and the Big Ten Network. He was named the alternate television play-by-play voice for the Boston Red Sox in 2019, filling in for regular play-by-play voice Dave O'Brien when O'Brien had prior commitments calling college football on the ACC Network. As a resident of Chicago, Monaco has also filled in on telecasts for Chicago White Sox, Chicago Bulls, and Chicago Blackhawks games.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nMike Monaco on Twitter\nThe Monaco Grand Prix (French: Grand Prix de Monaco) is a Formula One motor racing event held annually on the Circuit de Monaco, in late May or early June. Run since 1929, it is widely considered to be one of the most important and prestigious automobile races in the world, and is one of the races\u2014along with the Indianapolis 500 and the 24 Hours of Le Mans\u2014that form the Triple Crown of Motorsport. It is the only Grand Prix that does not adhere to the FIA's mandated 305-kilometre (190-mile) minimum race distance for Formula One races.\nThe race is held on a narrow course laid out in the streets of Monaco, with many elevation changes and tight corners as well as the tunnel, making it one of the most demanding circuits in Formula One. In spite of the relatively low average speeds, the Monaco circuit is a dangerous place to race due to how narrow the track is, and the race often involves the intervention of a safety car.\nThe first Monaco Grand Prix took place on 14 April 1929, and the race eventually became part of the pre-Second World War European Championship and was included in the first World Championship of Drivers in 1950. It was twice designated the European Grand Prix, in 1955 and 1963, when this title was an honorary designation given each year to one Grand Prix race in Europe. Graham Hill was known as \"Mr. Monaco\" due to his five Monaco wins in the 1960s. Ayrton Senna won the race more times than any other driver, with six victories, winning five races consecutively between 1989 and 1993. In the 81 editions of the Monaco Grand Prix, only two Mon\u00e9gasque drivers have won the race, Louis Chiron in 1931 and Charles Leclerc in 2024.\nThe circuit has been called \"an exceptional location of glamour and prestige\". The Formula One event is usually held on the last weekend of May and is known as one of the largest weekends in motor racing, as the Formula One race occurs on the same Sunday as the Indianapolis 500 (IndyCar Series) and the Coca-Cola 600 (NASCAR Cup Series).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nLike many European races, the Monaco Grand Prix predates the current World Championship. The principality's first Grand Prix was organised in 1929 by Antony Nogh\u00e8s, under the auspices of Prince Louis II, through the Automobile Club de Monaco (ACM), of which he was president. The ACM organised the Rallye Automobile Monte Carlo, and in 1928 applied to the Association Internationale des Automobiles Clubs Reconnus (AIACR), the international governing body of motorsport, to be upgraded from a regional French club to full national status. Their application was refused due to the lack of a major motorsport event held wholly within Monaco's boundaries. The rally could not be considered, as it mostly used the roads of other European countries.\nTo attain full national status, Nogh\u00e8s proposed the creation of an automobile Grand Prix in the streets of Monte Carlo. He obtained the official sanction of Prince Louis II and the support of Mon\u00e9gasque Grand Prix driver Louis Chiron. Chiron thought Monaco's topography was well-suited to setting up a race track.\nThe first race, held on 14 April 1929, was won by William Grover-Williams (using the pseudonym \"Williams\"), driving a works Bugatti Type 35B. It was an invitation-only event, but not all of those who were invited decided to attend. The leading Maserati and Alfa Romeo drivers decided not to compete, but Bugatti was well represented. Mercedes sent their leading driver, Rudolf Caracciola. Starting fifteenth, Caracciola drove a fighting race, taking his SSK into the lead before wasting 4+1\u20442 minutes on refuelling and a tyre change to finish second. Another driver who competed using a pseudonym was \"Georges Philippe\", the Baron Philippe de Rothschild. Chiron was unable to compete, having a prior commitment to compete in the Indianapolis 500.\nCaracciola's SSK was refused permission to race the following year, but Chiron did compete (in the works Bugatti Type 35C), when he was beaten by privateer Ren\nLouis II (Louis Honor\u00e9 Charles Antoine Grimaldi; 12 July 1870 \u2013 9 May 1949) was Prince of Monaco from 26 June 1922 to 9 May 1949.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nBorn in Baden-Baden, Germany, Louis II was the only child of Albert I, Prince of Monaco (1848\u20131922), and Lady Mary Victoria Hamilton (1850\u20131922). His mother was a daughter of William Hamilton, 11th Duke of Hamilton and Princess Marie Amelie of Baden.\nLouis was born within a year of his parents' marriage, but his mother, a strong-willed 19-year-old, disliked Monaco and was unhappy with her husband. She left the country permanently shortly after the birth, and the couple's marriage was annulled in 1880. Louis was raised in Germany by his mother and stepfather, Count (later Prince) Tassilo Festetics von Tolna, along with his eldest half-sister Maria-Mathilde (later grandmother of Princess Ira von F\u00fcrstenberg); he did not see his father until age 11 when he was obliged to return to Monaco to be trained for his future princely duties.\nLouis's father, Prince Albert I, was a dominating personality who had made Monaco a centre of cultural activity and whose intellectual achievements were recognized around the world. Unhappy to be living with his cold and distant father, Louis went to France as soon as he was old enough to enroll in Saint-Cyr, the French national military college. Four years later, after graduating, he was attached to the French Foreign Legion and then served with a regiment of Chasseurs d'Afrique (African Light Horse) in Algeria.\nBefore being stationed in Algeria, he met Marie Juliette Louvet (1867\u20131930), a cabaret singer, on a short official visit to Paris. Juliette was already the mother of two children, Georges and Marguerite, by her former husband, French \"girlie\" photographer Achille Delmaet (1860\u20131914). Reportedly, Prince Louis fell deeply in love but, because of her ignominious station in life, his father would not permit the marriage. It has been asserted that Louis ignored his father and married Juliette in 1897: there is, however, no evidence for this allegation. They had an out-of-wedlock daughter, Charlotte Louise Juliette, born on 30 September 1898 in Constantine, Algeria. There is no mention of Louvet in the authorized biography of her grandson, Prince Rainier III, who is Monegasque by nationality but whose ancestors include people of French, Mexican, Italian, German, Scottish, and English nationality.\nLouis served in the French Army for four years from 1895 to 1899, reaching the rank of lieutenant. He was awarded the m\u00e9daille coloniale (Colonial Medal) and the Cross of the Legion of Honor. At the conclusion of his military service, he returned to Monaco, leaving behind his mistress and daughter. At the outbreak of World War I, he re-enlisted in the French Army as a volunteer, serving as a staff officer under General Franchet d\u2019Esp\u00e8rey. Louis was made a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor and eventually became a brigadier general.\n\n\n== Solution to succession aspects in 1911\u201318 ==\nA political crisis loomed for the Prince because without any other heir, the throne of Monaco would pass to his first cousin Wilhelm, the 2nd Duke of Urach, a German nobleman who was a son of Prince Albert's aunt, Princess Florestine of Monaco. To ensure this did not happen, in 1911 a law was passed recognizing his out-of-wedlock daughter, Charlotte, as Louis's acknowledged heir, and making her part of the princely family. This law was later held to be invalid, and thus another law was passed in 1918 modifying the statutes to allow the adoption of an heir with succession rights. Charlotte was formally adopted by Louis in 1919 and became Charlotte Louise Juliette Grimaldi, Princess of Monaco and Duchess of Valentinois.\nWilhelm, 2nd Duke of Urach, thus placed further back in the line of succession to the throne of Monaco, was chosen as King of Lithuania for a few months in 1918, being known as Mindaugas II. It is a moot point whether he could be the sovereign of two European countri", "metadata": {"title": "Monaco", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco"}}
