Durant (1861–1947) started the company on November 3, 1911 as the Chevrolet Motor Car Company. Durant used the Chevrolet Motor Car Company to acquire a controlling stake in General Motors with a reverse merger occurring on May 2, 1918, and propelled himself back to the GM presidency. After Durant's second ousting in 1919, Alfred Sloan, with his maxim \"a car for every purse and purpose\", picked the Chevrolet brand to become the volume leader in the General Motors family, selling mainstream vehicles to compete with Henry Ford's Model T in 1919 and overtaking Ford as the best-selling car in the United States by 1929 with the Chevrolet International.\nChevrolet-branded vehicles are sold in most automotive markets worldwide. In Oceania, Chevrolet was represented by Holden Special Vehicles, having returned to the region in 2018 after a 50-year absence with the launching of the Camaro and Silverado pickup truck (HSV was partially and formerly owned by GM subsidiary Holden, which GM retired in 2021). In 2021, General Motors Specialty Vehicles took over the distribution and sales of Chevrolet vehicles in Oceania, starting with the Silverado. In 2005, Chevrolet was relaunched in Europe, primarily selling vehicles built by GM Daewoo of South Korea with the tagline \"Daewoo has grown up enough to become Chevrolet\", a move rooted in General Motors' attempt to build a global brand around Chevrolet. With the reintroduction of Chevrolet to Europe, GM intended Chevrolet to be a mainstream value brand, while GM's traditional European standard-bearers, Opel of Germany and Vauxhall of the United Kingdom, were to be moved upmarket. However, GM reversed this move in late 2013, announcing that the brand would be withdrawn from Europe from 2016 onward, with the exception of the Camaro and Corvette. Chevrolet vehicles were to continue to be marketed in the CIS states, including Russia. After General Motors fully acquired GM Daewoo in 2011 to create GM Korea, the last usage of the Daewoo automotive brand was discontinued in its native South Korea and succeeded by Chevrolet.\nIn North America, Chevrolet produces and sells a wide range of vehicles, from subcompact automobiles to medium-duty commercial trucks. Due to the prominence and name recognition of Chevrolet as one of General Motors' global marques, 'Chevrolet', 'Chevy' or 'Chev' is used at times as a synonym for General Motors or its products, one example being the GM LS1 engine, commonly known by the name or a variant thereof of its progenitor, the Chevrolet small-block engine.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn November 8, 1911, the Chevrolet Motor Car Company was incorporated. It was founded by Swiss race car driver and automotive engineer Louis Chevrolet with his brother Arthur Chevrolet, William C. Durant and investment partners William Little (maker of the Little automobile), former Buick owner James H. Whiting, Edwin R. Campbell (son-in-law of Durant) and in 1912 R. S. McLaughlin CEO of General Motors in Canada. Former Buick officers were also employed, including Curtis R. Hatheway as secretary.\nDurant was dismissed from his senior management position at General Motors in 1910, a company that he had founded in 1908. In 1904 he had taken over the Flint Wagon Works and Buick Motor Company of Flint, Michigan. He also incorporated the Mason and Little companies. As head of Buick, Durant had hired Louis Chevrolet to drive Buicks in promotional races. Durant planned to use Chevrolet's reputation as a racer as the foundation for his new automobile company. The first factory location was in Flint, Michigan at the corner of Wilcox and Kearsley Street, now known as \"Chevy Commons\" at coordinates 43.00863°N 83.70991°W﻿ / 43.00863; -83.70991﻿ (Chevy Commons), along the Flint River, acr\nThe Chevrolet Silverado is a range of trucks manufactured by General Motors under the Chevrolet brand. Introduced for the 1999 model year, the Silverado is the successor to the long-running Chevrolet C/K model line. Taking its name from the top trim level from the Chevrolet C/K series, the Silverado is offered as a series of full-size pickup trucks, chassis cab trucks, and medium-duty trucks. The fourth generation of the model line was introduced for the 2019 model year.\nThe Chevrolet Silverado shares mechanical commonality with the identically related GMC Sierra; GMC ended the use of the C/K nomenclature a model generation prior to Chevrolet. In Mexico, high-trim level versions of the Silverado use the Chevrolet Cheyenne name (not to be confused with the 2003 concept). Competing against the Ford F-Series, Ram pickup, Toyota Tundra, and Nissan Titan, the Silverado is among the best-selling vehicles in the United States, having sold over 12 million trucks since its introduction in 1998 as a 1999 model year.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Silverado nameplate made its debut for the 1975 model year, becoming the top trim level on all Chevrolet C/K trucks, slotted above Custom Deluxe, Scottsdale, and Cheyenne. For the 1968 model year (seven years before the Silverado), GMC C/K trucks used variations of the Sierra name (Sierra, Sierra Classic, Sierra Grande, and High Sierra). Even after the C/K series officially ended, GM still uses the CK and the CC in their current model codes, to denote a two-wheel drive (CC), and four-wheel drive (CK).\nFor the 1988 GMT400 model architecture, Chevrolet retained the C/K model nomenclature, with GMC branding its full-size line as Sierras. While sharing the same body and chassis, the model chronology of the Silverado and Sierra are different, with five generations of the Sierra, while four of the Silverado.\n\nIn 2018, at the NTEA Work Truck Show in Indianapolis, Indiana, Chevrolet unveiled the first medium-duty Silverado, expanding the model line to a 4500HD, 5500HD, and 6500HD chassis cab. Largely the successor to the 2003–2009 GMT560 chassis, the medium-duty trucks are exclusive to Chevrolet, with no plans for an equivalent GMC version. Instead, Navistar International (now partnering with GM) would sell the medium-duty trucks as a rebadged counterpart, called the CV. This is in fact a very similar nod to how the Avalanche did not have a GMC Yukon–based equivalent, but instead, Cadillac would take its place as the former's rebadged counterpart, the Escalade EXT.\n\n\n== First-generation Silverado / second-generation Sierra (GMT800; 1999) ==\n\nThe GMT800 Silverado/Sierra 1500 and 2500 pickup trucks were released in August 1998 as 1999 models. The \"classic\" light-duty GMT400 C/K trucks continued to be produced for the first two years alongside the new models, and the Heavy-Duty GMT400 pickups (alongside the GMT400 SUVs) were continued until 2000, with the new GMT800 Silverado/Sierra HD (Heavy Duty) released a year later. A 3500 model was added later for 2001, with the introduction of the HD moniker (though it was not until the 2007 GMT900 model year a 3500HD debuted).\nThe trucks were refreshed in 2002 for the 2003 model year, bringing slight design changes and an upgrade to the audio and HVAC controls. The 2007 GMT800 trucks, built after the new GMT900 entered production, used the name Classic to denote the difference between the two generations.\n\n\n== Second-generation Silverado / third-generation Sierra (GMT900; 2007) ==\n\nThe GMT900 generation of the Silverado/Sierra arrived in the last quarter of 2006 as a 2007 model. It features a redesigned exterior, interior, frame, and suspension as well as power increases on certain engines. Like the previous generation GMT800's and earlier C/K lines, it takes many styling cues from the GMT900 SUVs of the same year. Like the GMT900 SUVs, these pickups have improved aerodynamics over their predecessors thanks to steeply raked windshields and tighter panel gaps which help impro\nChevrolet Nomad is a nameplate used by Chevrolet in North America from the 1950s to the 1970s, applied largely to station wagons. Three different Nomads were produced as a distinct model line, with Chevrolet subsequently using the name as a trim package.\nMarketed as a halo model of the Chevrolet station wagon line for the Tri-Five series, the Nomad was repackaged as a station wagon counterpart of the Chevrolet Bel Air and Chevrolet Impala from 1958 to 1961.  From 1968 to 1972, the Nomad returned as the base-trim Chevrolet Chevelle station wagon.\nMaking its debut on a 1954 concept car, the nameplate has again seen used by Chevrolet on multiple concept vehicles; none have reached production.\n\n\n== Development ==\nThe Chevrolet Nomad was introduced in 1954 as part of the General Motors Motorama line of \"dream cars\" developed by GM head stylist Harley Earl.  As a follow-up to the Chevrolet Corvette roadster and Chevrolet (Corvette) Corvair fastback of the year before, the Nomad was a \"dream car\" alongside the Pontiac Bonneville Special and Oldsmobile F-88; the latter two were experimental prototypes built on Corvette chassis.\nAdopting the front fascia of the Corvette to a two-door wagon body, the Nomad shifted away from the utilitarian design of traditional station wagons, introducing a forward-slanting B-pillar and nearly wraparound rear windows.\nFollowing a positive response to the Motorama design, GM approved the Nomad for 1955 production.  As a prerequisite for approval, the design was to be adopted to the standard A-body Chevrolet chassis, both larger and more widely produced than the Corvette.  The use of the A-body also allowed GM to produce the vehicle as a Pontiac.\n\nWhile it is believed that GM ultimately destroyed the concept vehicle (as was common practice of the time), several reproductions of the Nomad concept exist today, mating Corvette front fascias to production Nomad bodies.\n\n\n== Tri-Five (1955–1957) ==\n\nSharing its roofline design nearly intact from the 1954 Motorama \"dream car\", the first version of the Chevrolet Nomad was produced as a two-door \"sport wagon\".  While considered a distinct model line, the Nomad was trimmed in line with the Bel Air sedan, along with its badging.\nThe production Nomad was the Chevrolet counterpart of the Pontiac Safari; while the two vehicles shared an identical chassis and roofline, the Safari shared its front fascia with the Pontiac Chieftain and interior trim with the Pontiac Star Chief (its sedan counterpart).\n\n\n=== 1955 ===\nPriced at $2571, the Nomad was among the most expensive 1955 Chevrolets (excluding the Corvette); the model line received a 265 cubic-inch V8 as standard equipment.  While the Nomad received Bel Air fender badging, to emphasize its roofline, the Nomad only shared the front fender trim and door trim with the Bel Air.  In contrast with other Chevrolets, the Nomad was designed with fully radiused rear wheel openings (a design feature of the Corvette).  Coinciding with the design of its roofline, the Nomad shared its front doors with the Bel Air hardtop and convertible (using frameless door glass).\nAs with the four-door Beauville station wagon, the Nomad received interior trim similar to the Bel Air sedan; the model line was the only two-door Chevrolet wagon fitted with interior carpeting and cloth seats.  Though distinguished by its forward-sloping rear window, tailgate, and B-pillar, the Nomad included a two-piece split tailgate and flat-folding rear seat.\n\n\n=== 1956 ===\nSharing the same front fascia update as other 1956 Chevrolets, the exterior of the Nomad adopted the revised side-panel trim of the Bel Air.  Again called both a Nomad and a Bel Air Nomad interchangeably, the model line received a standard two-tone exterior and interior.  The fully-radiused rear wheel openings were dropped for the Nomad; all non-Corvette Chevrolets received a larger rear-wheel cutout.\nFor 1956, Ford introduced the Ford Parklane as a direct competitor of the Nomad.  While the Pa\nThis page lists sport utility vehicles currently in production (as of 2013) as well as past models. The list includes crossover SUVs, Mini SUVs, Compact SUVs and other similar vehicles. Also includes hybrid, luxury, sport or tuned, military, electric and fuel cell versions. Due to similarity, Sport Utility Trucks are also in this list.\nNote: Many of the vehicles (both current and past) are related to other vehicles in the list. A vehicle listed as a 'past model' may still be in production in an updated form under a different name, it may be listed under that name in the 'currently in production' section. Also, some vehicles are sold under different marques in different geographical locations, therefore some vehicles may be listed more than once but usually link to the same page. Different states may also classify vehicles differently. What may be considered an SUV in one state, may not in another state.

Automotive Guide\nThe Chevrolet Van or Chevy Van (also known as the Chevrolet/GMC G-series vans and GMC Vandura) is a range of vans that was manufactured by General Motors from the 1964 to 1996 model years. Introduced as the successor for the rear-engine Corvair Corvan/Greenbrier, the model line also replaced the panel van configuration of the Chevrolet Suburban. The vehicle was sold both in passenger van and cargo van configurations as well as a cutaway van chassis that served as the basis for a variety of custom applications.\nProduced across three generations (1964–1966, 1967–1970, and 1970–1996), the model line was sold under a wide variety of model names under both the Chevrolet and GMC brands.  The first two generations were forward control vehicles (with the engine placed between the seats); the third generation adopted a configuration placing the engine forward of the driver.  The second and third generations shared powertrain commonality with the C/K pickup truck model line.\nAfter the 1996 model year, GM retired the G-Series vans, replacing them with the GMT600-platform Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana.\n\n\n== First generation (1964–1966) ==\n\nThe first General Motors van was the Chevrolet Corvair–based Chevrolet Greenbrier van, or Corvan introduced for 1961, which used an air-cooled flat-six rear engine design, inspired by the Volkswagen bus. Production of the Chevrolet Greenbrier ended during the 1965 model year.\nFirst-generation Chevrolet van refers to the first G-10 half-ton production years 1964 through 1966. General Motors saw a market for a compact van based on a modified passenger car platform to compete with the already successful Ford Econoline and Dodge A100. The 1964 Chevrolet van had a cab-forward design with the engine placed in a \"doghouse\" between and behind the front seats. The implementation of situating the driver on top of the front axle with the engine near the front wheels is called internationally a \"cab over\" vehicle. Engines and brakes were sourced from the Chevy II, a more conventional compact car than Chevrolet Corvair.\nThe model was also sold by GMC as the \"Handi-Van\". The first-generation vans were available in only the short 90-inch wheelbase and were only sold with the standard 153 cu in (2.5 L) 90 hp straight-4 or a Chevrolet Straight-6 engine. A first-generation is identified by its single-piece flat windshield glass. The first 1964 Chevrolet van was originally marketed and sold as a panel van for purely utilitarian purposes. Windows were available as an option, but were simply cut into the sides from the factory. In 1965, Chevrolet added the \"Sportvan\", which featured windows integrated into the body. GMC marketed its window van as \"Handi-Bus\". Factory-installed air conditioning, power steering, and power brakes were not available in the first-generation vans.\n\n\n=== 1964 ===\nThe new van was of simple construction and its box shape was designed to maximize the hauling of cargo, tools, and equipment. The base cargo model was the Chevy-Van, available with or without windows and side cargo doors. Basic amenities such as a heater and a right-front passenger seat were options.\nThe 90 hp (67 kW; 91 PS) 153 cu in (2.5 L) four-cylinder engine was standard equipment. Optional was the 120 hp (89 kW; 122 PS) 194 cu in (3.2 L) Chevrolet Straight-6 engine.\nThe Warner 3-speed manual transmission was standard with a column shift. A 2-speed Powerglide automatic transmission was optional.\n\n\n=== 1965 ===\nFor 1965, there were minor changes across all models. The grille openings were widened and received one additional slot just above the bumper to increase cooling. Seat belts were added. The four-cylinder engine was discontinued. The 194 cu in (3.2 L) I6 became standard equipment while the \"High Torque\" 230 cu in (3.8 L) I6 rated at 140 hp (104 kW; 142 PS) was optional.\n\n\n== Second generation (1967–1970) ==\n\nIn 1967, the Chevrolet van received a major interior and exterior facelift. The forward control cab design was retained\nThe Chevrolet Caprice is a full-size car produced by Chevrolet in North America for the 1965 through 1996 model years. Full-size Chevrolet sales peaked in 1965, with over a million units sold. It was the most popular car in the U.S. in the 1960s and early 1970s, which, during its production, included the Biscayne, Bel Air, and Impala.\nIntroduced in mid-1965 as a luxury trim package for the Impala four-door hardtop, Chevrolet offered a full line of Caprice models for the 1966 and subsequent model years, including a \"formal hardtop\" coupe and an Estate station wagon. The 1971 through 1976 models are the largest Chevrolets built. The downsized 1977 and restyled 1991 models were awarded Motor Trend Car of the Year. Production ended in 1996.\nFrom 2011 until 2017, the Caprice nameplate returned to North America as a full-size, rear wheel drive police vehicle, a captive import from Australia, built by General Motors's subsidiary Holden. The police vehicle is a rebadged version of the Holden WM/WN Caprice. The nameplate also had a civilian and police presence in the Middle East from 1999 until 2017, where the imported Holden Statesman/Caprice built by Holden was marketed as the Chevrolet Caprice in markets such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\n\n\n== Early history ==\nThere are differing accounts of the origin of the Caprice name. One states that it was coined by Bob Lund, Chevrolet's General Sales Manager, after a classy restaurant he frequented in New York City. Another says the car was named after Caprice Chapman, the daughter of auto executive James P. Chapman.\nA Caprice Custom Sedan option package (RPO Z18) was offered on the 1965 Chevrolet Impala 4-door hardtop, adding US$200 (equivalent to $1,934 in 2023) to the US$2,742 (equivalent to $26,511 in 2023) price tag. The Caprice option included a heavier frame, suspension changes, black-accented front grille and rear trim panel with Caprice nameplate, slender body sill moldings, Fleur-de-lis roof quarter emblems, color-keyed bodyside stripes and Caprice hood and dash emblems. Full wheel covers were the same as that year's Super Sport, but a Chevy bowtie emblem replaced the \"SS\" emblem in the spinner's center. The Super Sport's blackout rear trim panel was also used, but without the \"Impala SS\" nameplate. The interior featured a higher-grade cloth and vinyl seat and door trim (as well as thicker, higher-grade carpeting), faux walnut trim on the dashboard and door panels, pull straps on the doors, and extra convenience lights. A full vinyl roof was optional. A 283 cu in (4.6 L), 195 hp (145 kW) V8 engine was standard, as was a column-mounted shifter for the three-speed manual transmission.\nThe Caprice was intended to compete with the Ford LTD, Plymouth VIP, and AMC's Ambassador DPL. These models included luxuriously upholstered interiors with simulated wood dashboard and door-panel trim, thicker carpeting, sound insulation, courtesy lighting, and more upscale exterior trims.\n\n\n== First generation (1966–1970) ==\n\n\n=== 1966 ===\n\nCaprice gained series status for the 1966 model year and was positioned as the top-line full-size Chevrolet. It included a four-door hardtop, six- or nine-passenger station wagon, and a two-door hardtop with a squared-off formal roofline in contrast to the Impala/SS Sport Coupe's fastback roof styling. All four Caprice models were marketed as \"Caprice Custom.\"\nThe Caprice Custom Estate, a new station wagon model with simulated woodgrain exterior trim was the first Chevrolet with such a design since its real woodie wagon was offered in 1954 on the Chevrolet Bel Air. All wagons included an all-vinyl upholstered two-row bench seat interior with an optional third rear-facing seat for two. The Custom Estate became the full-sized station wagon when the Buick LeSabre Estate was discontinued in 1964. The 283 cu in (4.6 L) V8 engine was standard for Caprice models with the 325 hp (242 kW) 396 cu in (6.5 L) \"Turbo Jet\" V8 optional. It was possible to have Regular Production Opt\nThe Chevrolet Tahoe (), and its badge-engineered GMC Yukon counterpart, are full-size SUVs and other trucks from General Motors, offered since 1994 and 1991, respectively. Since 1982, Chevrolet and GMC sold two different-sized SUVs under their \"Blazer\" and \"Jimmy\" nameplates, by introducing the smaller S-10 Blazer and GMC S-15 Jimmy for the 1983 model year, below the full-size Blazer and Jimmy models. This situation lasted into the early 1990s. GMC first rebadged the full-size Jimmy as the \"Yukon\" in 1991. Chevrolet however waited until 1994, when they rebadged the redesigned mid-size S-10 Blazer the \"new Blazer,\" while renaming the full-size Blazer as the \"Tahoe.\" The name Tahoe refers to the rugged and scenic area surrounding Lake Tahoe in the western United States, and was originally used as a trim level on S-10 models. The name Yukon refers to the Yukon territory of northern Canada.\nFor the 1995 model year, the Tahoe and Yukon gained a new, longer four-door model, slotting in size between the two-door models and the longer-wheelbase Chevrolet/GMC Suburbans.\nThe Tahoe is sold in North America, parts of Asia such as the Philippines, and the Middle East, plus other countries including Bolivia, Chile, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and Angola as a left-hand-drive vehicle. The Yukon is only sold in North America and the Middle East.\nThe Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon are part of General Motors' full-size SUV family and are differentiated from the similar Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon XL primarily by the length of the passenger and cargo area behind the C-pillar. An upscale trim GMC Denali sub-model joined the Yukon lineup as the top-of-the-line trim for the 1999 model year; the Cadillac Escalade is a closely related upscale version sharing the same platform. The Denali is available on both standard and XL versions.\nThe Tahoe has regularly been the best-selling full-size SUV in the United States, frequently outselling its competition by two to one.\n\n\n== First generation (1992) ==\n\nThe new GMC Yukon was introduced in 1991 for the 1992 model year, succeeding the 2nd generation (K5) Jimmy, while Chevrolet continued to use the Blazer name on its third-generation K5 model, through the 1994 model year. Removable hard-tops were dropped. All models now had a full-length steel roof, and were 2-door wagons only, through 1994.\nHowever, for 1995, the \"Blazer\" nameplate was discontinued (now used only on the mid-size GMT325 Blazer), and the model was rebranded as the all-new Chevrolet Tahoe, while also adding all-new, longer 4-door versions, for both brands. Four-door Yukon and Tahoe production started on January 20, 1995, at Janesville Assembly. The Tahoe was Motor Trend magazine's Truck of the Year for 1996.\nThe Tahoe and Yukon are considerably shorter than the Suburban on which they are based, but share that vehicle's GMT400 platform. It is built on a true truck chassis, derived from the one in the C/K 1500 full-size pickup truck. Both two-door and four-door models were produced in rear- and four-wheel drive versions. Four-door models had a 6 in (15 cm) longer wheelbase, and 11 in (28 cm) greater length than the two-door models. Two-door models weighed roughly 4,500 lb (2,041 kg) while four-door models weighed about 5,500 lb (2,495 kg). Tahoes were available in base, LS, and LT trim levels, and the Yukon in base, SLE, and SLT. A \"Yukon GT\" trim level on 1992–1994 2-door Yukons was also available, featuring monochromatic grille, front and rear bumpers, \"Yukon GT\" badges on both doors, and bucket seating with center console. \"AutoTrac\" full-time all-wheel drive and a programmable Homelink garage door transmitter were added for 1998. The upscale Denali trim line for the Yukon was introduced in 1999.\nThe standard engine was Chevrolet's 350 cu in (5.7 L) small-block V8, while a turbocharged 6.5 L (395 cu in) Detroit Diesel V8 was available beginning in 1994. The 6.5-liter turbo diesel was only available in two-door 4WD models and was detuned to 36\nThe Chevrolet Bolt EV (marketed in Europe as Opel Ampera-e) is a battery electric subcompact hatchback manufactured and marketed by General Motors under its Chevrolet brand from late 2016 until mid-2021 and again from early 2022 to late 2023. In mid-2023, GM officials said they would discontinue the Bolt; after outcry, they announced plans but no date for a next-generation model.\nThe first-generation Bolt was developed and manufactured with LG Corporation. Sales of the 2017 Bolt began in California in December 2016; it was released nationwide and international markets release in 2017. A rebadged European variant was marketed as the Opel Ampera-e in mainland Europe.\nIn 2017, the Bolt was the second-best-selling plug-in car in the United States. It was named the 2017 Motor Trend Car of the Year, the 2017 North American Car of the Year, an Automobile magazine 2017 All Star, and was listed in Time magazine's Best 25 Inventions of 2016. The Ampera-e was discontinued after 2018. By the end of 2020, GM had sold 112,000 Bolt and Ampera-e cars worldwide.\nThe first-generation Bolt has been subject to at least three recalls. At least 16 Bolts have caught fire, leading to a recall to fix or replace battery components and GM's August 2021 advisory to park in open areas, at least 50 feet (15 m) away from other vehicles.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nGM Korea began developing the Bolt in 2012 with a team of 180 people with the project code G2KCZ (G2 for Gamma 2nd-generation platform, K for hatchback, C for Chevrolet, and Z for electric car). Its initial concept debuted at the 2015 North American International Auto Show.\n\nAs of June 2015, General Motors had tested more than 50 hand-built Bolt prototypes at the General Motors Proving Grounds in Milford, Michigan. The cars were tested at Proving Grounds and overseas for ride and handling dynamics, cabin comfort, quietness, charging capability, and energy efficiency.\nAlan Batey, head of General Motors North America, announced in February 2015 that the Bolt EV was headed for production, and would be available in all 50 states. GM also has plans to sell the Bolt in select global markets.\nIn January 2016, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the production version of the Chevrolet Bolt was unveiled. During GM CEO Mary Barra's keynote at the show, Chevrolet confirmed an estimated range of 200 miles (320 km) or more, an approximate US$30,000 price tag (after government incentives), and stated it would be available in late 2016. Barra projected in February 2016 that the European version, marketed as the Opel Ampera-e (or Vauxhall Ampera-e in the United Kingdom), would enter production in 2017.\nIn March 2016, GM released photos and a short pre-production video of the Bolt at the company's Orion Assembly plant outside Detroit, testing manufacturing and tooling.\nThe car's user interface was developed in Israel.\n\n\n=== Profitability ===\nAn unnamed source cited by Bloomberg News estimated that General Motors is expected to take a loss of US$8,000 to US$9,000 per Bolt sold. A GM spokesman declined to comment about expected profitability. Opel refuted that in December 2016 and stated that GM has battery cell costs of $130/kWh, and industry is not yet optimized for mass production. A UBS tear-down in 2017 suggested slightly smaller losses per vehicle, of $7418 on a base spec, or $5520 on a higher spec vehicle. They estimate that by 2025 the Bolt will make a profit of about $6000 per vehicle.\n\n\n=== Production ===\nFinal assembly took place at GM's Orion Assembly plant in Orion Township, Michigan, which received a US$160 million upgrade for Bolt production. Manufacture of the battery, motor, and drive unit started in August 2016 at LG, Incheon, South Korea.\nThe car is designed for flexible production by having some of the battery in the same position as the fuel tank in internal combustion engine-powered cars, and is made on the same assembly line as the Chevrolet Sonic at a combined rate of 90,\nThe Chevrolet Astro is a minivan that was manufactured and marketed by the Chevrolet division of American auto manufacturer General Motors from 1985 to 2005. Sold alongside the GMC Safari, the Astro was marketed in multiple configurations, including passenger van and cargo van.\nThe Astro and Safari used a rear-wheel-drive chassis; all-wheel drive became an option in 1990. For its entire production, the Astro and Safari were produced by Baltimore Assembly in Baltimore, Maryland; the vans would be the final model line produced by the facility. In total, approximately 3.2 million Astros and Safaris were produced from 1985 through 2005.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Astro and Safari were introduced for the 1985 model year as the first minivan from General Motors. While marketed as a response to the first-generation Chrysler minivans, GM selected a rear-wheel drive layout, sizing the Astro and Safari closely to the short-wheelbase Chevrolet G10 van. Similar to the Ford Aerostar, to reduce production costs, GM adapted light-truck powertrain components; engines and transmissions were sourced from the Chevrolet S-10, allowing for a towing capacity of up to 5,500 lb (2,500 kg).\nPrior to its use on a minivan, the Astro nameplate was used twice by General Motors; in 1967 (for the Chevrolet Astro 1 concept car) and from 1969 until 1987 (on the GMC Astro COE semitractor). GMC sourced the Safari nameplate from Pontiac (used by the latter to denote station wagons). As GMC was half of the Pontiac/GMC Division (later including Buick), from 1985 through 1989, both GMC and Pontiac Safaris were simultaneously offered through the same dealership network.\n\n\n== First generation (1985–1994) ==\n\nInitial advertising boasted that it was a vehicle that will \"make you realize that life is too big for a minivan,\" referring to the Chrysler minivans. The van can have a seating configuration between two and eight passengers.\nEngine choices ranged from a 98 hp (73 kW; 99 PS) 2.5L four-cylinder to a 200 hp (149 kW; 203 PS) 4.3L V6, depending on options and model year. The 4-cylinder engine was only offered in short-length, rear-wheel-drive cargo vans, as well as passenger vans for 1985 only; it was dropped after 1990. For 1985, the 4.3L V6 (RPO LB1) used a 4-barrel carburetor. For 1986, throttle body fuel injection (TBI) was used. For 1992 and later years, a central port injection was used.\nMuch like the second-generation F-body 1970–1981 and X-body vehicles, the Astro/Safari (internally designated as the M-body for RWD models or L-body for AWD models) had a bolt-on subframe. For the M-van, the front suspension shared most components with the GM B-body station wagon (Chevrolet Caprice, Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser and larger variants of the Pontiac Safari and Buick Estate Wagon) with a leaf-spring rear suspension. The lower ball joints were larger than their B-body counterparts (similar to the 1977–96 Cadillac D platform vehicles; e.g., Fleetwood limousines). These ball joints were later used in the final Chevrolet Caprice 9C1 (police package) cars manufactured in 1995 and 1996. They also shared many mechanical similarities to the GMT 325/330 mid-size S/T pickups and utility vehicles.\nDigital dashboards were offered in the first-generation Astro; this option did not continue after 1995.\n1989 was the final year that the BorgWarner T-5 manual transmission was made available. All subsequent models were equipped with 700R4/4L60 automatic transmissions through 1993.\nIn 1990, a new all-wheel drive (AWD) system (the first U.S.-built minivan to do so), designed and developed by FF Developments (FFD), was made optional. The AWD models had a lower fuel economy: 17 miles per gallon on the highway versus 20 to 21 miles per gallon for rear-wheel-drive vans. AWD Astros used a BorgWarner 4472 transfer case.\nThe 1990 model year also introduced a new analog dashboard and the Hydroboost braking system, a system using the same accessory belt-driven pump to supply the power steering and bra\nThe Chevrolet Suburban is a series of SUVs built by Chevrolet since the 1935 model year.  The longest-used automobile nameplate in the world, the Chevrolet Suburban is currently in its twelfth generation, introduced for 2021.  Beginning life as one of the first metal-bodied station wagons, the Suburban is the progenitor of the modern full-size SUV, combining a wagon-style body with the chassis and powertrain of a pickup truck.  Alongside its Advance Design, Task Force, and C/K predecessors, the Chevrolet Silverado currently shares chassis and mechanical commonality with the Suburban and other trucks.     \nTraditionally one of the most profitable vehicles sold by General Motors, the Suburban has been marketed through both Chevrolet and GMC for nearly its entire production.  Along sharing the Suburban name with Chevrolet, GMC has used several nameplates for the model line; since 2000, the division has marketed it as the GMC Yukon XL, while since 2003 Cadillac has marketed the Suburban as the Cadillac Escalade ESV.  During the 1990s, GM Australia marketed right-hand drive Suburbans under the Holden brand.    \nThe Suburban is sold in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central America, Chile, Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Peru, Philippines, and the Middle East (except Israel), while the Yukon XL is sold only in North America (exclusive to the United States, Canada, and Mexico) and the Middle East territories (except Israel).\nA 2018 iSeeCars.com study identified the Chevrolet Suburban as the car that is driven the most each year. A 2019 iSeeCars.com study named the Chevrolet Suburban the second-ranked longest-lasting vehicle. In December 2019, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce unveiled a Hollywood Walk of Fame star for the Suburban, noting that the Suburban had been in \"1,750 films and TV shows since 1952.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nSeveral automotive companies in the United States used the \"Suburban\" designation to indicate a windowed, station wagon–type body on a commercial frame including DeSoto, Dodge, Plymouth, Studebaker, and Nash, in addition to Chevrolet and GMC. The (Westchester) Suburban name was, in fact, a trademark of U.S. Body and Forging Co. of Tell City, Indiana, which built wooden station wagon bodies for all of these automobile and light truck chassis and more.\nChevrolet began production of its all-steel \"carryall-suburban\" in 1934. GMC brought out its version in 1937. These vehicles were also known as the \"Suburban Carryall\" until GM shortened the name to simply \"Suburban.\" GMC's equivalent to the Chevrolet model was originally named \"Suburban\" as well, until being rebranded as \"Yukon XL\" for the 2000 model year.\nWith the end of production of the Plymouth Fury Suburban station wagon in 1978, only General Motors continued to manufacture a vehicle branded as a \"Suburban,\" and GM was awarded an exclusive trademark on the name in 1988. The Chevrolet Suburban is one of the largest SUVs on the market today. It has outlasted competitive vehicles such as the International Harvester Travelall, Jeep Wagoneer, and the Ford Excursion. The latest competitor is the extended-length Ford Expedition EL, which indirectly replaced the Excursion.\nThe Suburban as of today is a full-size SUV (upgraded to extended-length from 1967 onward to make room for the then-new K5 Blazer that debuted in 1969) with three rows of seating, a full pickup truck frame, and V8 engine. It is one of the few station wagons available with all bench seating rows. The Suburban is the same height and width as the Chevrolet Tahoe, except that the Suburban is 15–20 inches (380–510 mm) longer. The extra length provides a full-sized cargo area behind the nine-passenger seating area.\nFrom 1973 to 2013, it had been available in half-ton and 3/4-ton versions. Chevrolet discontinued this option for the public during the tenth-generation model's tenure after 2013 because of slow sales. However, for the 2016 model year, a one-ton model debuted as an exclusive to rental, fleet, and \nThe Chevrolet Spark (Korean: 쉐보레 스파크) is a city car manufactured by General Motors's subsidiary GM Korea from 1998 to 2022. The vehicle was developed by Daewoo and introduced in 1998 as the Daewoo Matiz (Korean: 대우 마티즈). In 2002, General Motors purchased Daewoo Motors, which was marketing the vehicle with several GM marques and nameplates.\nThe third generation was marketed globally,  prominantly under the Chevrolet brand in North America as the Chevrolet Spark and in Australia and New Zealand as the Holden Barina Spark. The fourth generation was launched in 2015, known as the Holden Spark in Australia and New Zealand. It also serves as the basis for the Opel Karl in Europe, Vauxhall Viva in the UK, and VinFast Fadil in Vietnam, the latter being manufactured under license.\nA limited-production all-electric version, the Chevrolet Spark EV, was released in the U.S. in selected markets in California and Oregon in June 2013. The Spark EV was the first all-electric passenger car marketed by General Motors since the EV1 was discontinued in 1999, and also the first offered for retail sale by GM (the EV1 was available only on lease).\nIn the South Korean market, the Spark complies with South Korean \"light car\" (Korean: 경차, romanized: Gyeongcha) regulations, which regulate overall vehicle dimensions and engine capacity with tax and parking fee benefits.\nProduction of the Spark at the Changwon, South Korea assembly plant ended in 2022. The plant would instead produce the second-generation Trax.\n\n\n== First generation (M100, M150; 1998) ==\n\n\n=== M100 (1998–2000) ===\nThe production of Daewoo Matiz started in 1998, and it was marketed in South Korea and many European markets, internally designated the M100. The exterior design is based on the Lucciola, a 1993 Fiat Cinquecento concept by Fabrizio Giugiaro at Italdesign, which had been rejected by Fiat. The 0.8-litre gasoline engine and the transmission were carryovers from the Daewoo Tico, but as of 2013 used a multipoint fuel injection system. Engineering was carried out at Daewoo's Worthing Technical Centre in England. The car became the best selling Daewoo model in Europe and in India for the next four years.\nIt was developed on the basis of the Daewoo Tico under license of the Suzuki Alto, with which both Tico and Matiz share mechanicals and suspensions. From this origin was derived its characteristic narrow width, imposed by the Japanese kei car tax category.\nThe Matiz was launched with just a 0.8-litre straight-three engine. It developed a maximum power of 51 hp (38 kW) and a maximum torque of 68.5 N⋅m (51 lb⋅ft), and had a combined consumption of 6.4 L/100 km (44 mpg‑imp). It had a top speed of 144 km/h (89 mph) and could reach  100 km/h (62 mph) in 17 seconds. This engine was developed from the Tico unit by Tickford, a UK company based in Milton Keynes. The Tickford connection was acknowledged in the brochures distributed in UK showrooms.\nIt was released with three trim levels: E, S, and SE. The latter had air conditioning, wheel covers, body-colored bumpers, rear spoiler, fog lights, and a stereo, with optional features such as roof rails, power steering, central locking, electric front windows, antilock brakes, and driver airbag. In certain markets, it was also available with an automatic transmission.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== M150 (2000–2005) ===\nThis facelift was designed at Daewoo's Worthing Technical Centre in England, and introduced in South Korea in late 2000, and exported from 2001. The front-end structure was modified to accommodate a four-cylinder engine, although the introduction of this engine, the 1.0-litre S-Tec unit, was delayed until after Daewoo's takeover by General Motors in 2002.\nThe M150 continued to be produced by GM-Uzbekistan (previously UzDaewooAuto) in Uzbekistan until 2018. The car was launched to the Russian market as the Ravon Matiz in 2016, but was soon discontinued. In South Korea and Japan this updated Matiz was sold under the na\nThe Chevrolet Trax is a compact crossover SUV manufactured by General Motors and marketed under the Chevrolet brand since 2013, currently in its second generation.\nThe first generation model was released globally in 2013 as the smallest, entry-level crossover SUV offering from the brand. Development and production were centered in South Korea by GM Korea. A restyled model was also produced as the Buick Encore in North America and as the Opel/Vauxhall Mokka in Europe.\nIn several markets, the vehicle was marketed as the Chevrolet Tracker, and as the Holden Trax in Australia and New Zealand. The Trax became available in Canada, Mexico, Germany, South Korea, Lebanon, United Arab Emirates, and Europe for the 2013 model year and was released in the United States for the 2015 model year.\nIn 2019, GM released the replacement of the Trax for China and Latin America, the Tracker. The first-generation Trax continued to be marketed in North America, South Korea, and several other markets until 2022, when it was replaced by the larger second-generation Trax due for the 2024 model year. The second-generation Trax is also marketed in China as the Chevrolet Seeker.\n\n\n== First generation (U200; 2013) ==\n\nThe first-generation Trax (model code U200, designated TJ in Australia) was first shown as a concept car, which was first unveiled at the 2012 Paris Motor Show, with the final model unveiled at the 2013 North American International Auto Show. It was then available for test driving at the 2013 Montreal International Auto Show, with four essay models shown.\nThe SUV was in development since 2008 by GM's small vehicle development team centered in South Korea. It is based on the GM Gamma II platform, which is shared with the Chevrolet Aveo/Sonic and the Opel Mokka/Buick Encore. It was marketed as the Holden Trax in Australia and as the Chevrolet Tracker in Russia and South America. For most global markets, the Trax was produced by both GM Korea and GM Mexico. SAIC-GM also produced the model for the Chinese market from the 2015 model year until 2020. GM Uzbekistan also produced this model starting in late 2018.\nDuring 2013 and early 2014, the Trax was only sold in Canada, Mexico, Germany, South Korea, Lebanon, United Arab Emirates, and Europe.\nIn Canada, the Trax was the first compact Chevrolet crossover SUV since the discontinuation of the Tracker (read below). The vehicle started shipping on April 2, 2013; however, pre-sales began as early as the fourth quarter of 2012 for both Mexico (1.8 L) and Canada (1.4 L turbo). Sales in South Korea started in late February 2013.\nIn late 2014, the Trax was marketed to more countries including China, Indonesia, and the Philippines.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Markets ===\n\n\n==== South Korea ====\nThe Trax was introduced in South Korea in February 2013. It was powered by the 1.4 L turbocharged gasoline engine. In 2015, a 1.6-litre diesel engine was added. The facelift model was introduced in October 2016.\nIt was the most exported car of South Korea from 2016 to 2018.\n\n\n==== United States ====\nThe Trax came to the United States as a 2015 model, following the success of the Buick Encore (the Trax and Encore share the GM Gamma II platform) and possible competition from the Jeep Renegade; GM initially had no plans to offer the Trax to the U.S. market. The U.S.-market Trax was largely unchanged from the global version, but had some U.S.-specific features including OnStar with AT&T 4G LTE and SiriusXM satellite radio.\nThe U.S. version was powered by the 1.4 L turbocharged inline-4 with 138 bhp (103 kW; 140 PS) at 4,900 rpm and 148 lb⋅ft (201 N⋅m) at 1,850 rpm. Trailer towing was not recommended. Only the 6-speed automatic transmission was available.\nThree trim levels, both available with front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive, are available: LS, LT, and LTZ.\n\n\n=== 2017 refresh ===\nChevrolet performed a mid-cycle update on the Trax for the 2017 model year, first unveiled at the 2016 Chicago Auto Show on February 12, 2016. The \nThe Chevrolet HHR (an initialism for Heritage High Roof) is a retro-styled, high-roofed, five-door, five-passenger, front-wheel drive wagon  designed by Bryan Nesbitt and launched by the American automaker Chevrolet at the 2005 Los Angeles Auto Show as a 2006 model.\nThe HHR shares the GM Delta platform with the Chevrolet Cobalt, Pontiac G5, and Saturn Ion. Chevrolet also marketed a panel van variant of the HHR beginning in 2007.  Assembled in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico and marketed throughout North America, production of the HHR ended in May 2011. The HHR was replaced in the U.S. by the Chevrolet Captiva Sport, a rebadged version of the Opel Antara. However, the Captiva Sport was only available as a fleet vehicle and was not available new to the general public.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\nThe vehicle's design was inspired by the late-1940s/early 1950s Chevrolet cars and trucks, specifically the 1947 Chevrolet Suburban and Advance Design pickups, with large, square fender flares and a hemispherical grille. The design of the HHR has been credited to Bryan Nesbitt who was a former designer at Chrysler where he was the lead designer of the Chrysler PT Cruiser. Nesbitt was recruited by GM to join its design staff and served for a time as the chief designer of the Chevrolet brand. The HHR had a cargo-carrying capacity of 62.7 cubic feet (1.78 m3). All models had a flat-load floor (passenger models have 60/40 split bench) and fold-flat front passenger seat. For the 2007 model year, it was available in four trim levels; LS, LT, 2LT, and Special Edition. A panel van variant was also made available in 2007 for only the LT trim and became available on all trim levels in 2008.  A \"Half Panel\" (RPO code AA5) rear quarter window delete option was available in the 2008 to 2010 model years.\n\n\n== Standard and optional features ==\nEvery HHR came well-equipped with many standard features. These included power windows and door locks (front for the HHR Panel Van and front and rear for the standard HHR), dual front SRS airbags, a Driver Information Center, an A/M-F/M stereo radio with a single-disc CD/MP3 player and an auxiliary audio input jack, a four-speaker audio system, a tilt-adjustable steering wheel, keyless entry, cloth seating surfaces, a folding rear bench seat (for standard HHR models only), manually-adjustable dual (front) bucket seats, a compact spare tire and wheel, air conditioning, and a five-speed manual transmission. Upper trim levels added features such as a multifunction steering wheel, a cruise control system, aluminum-alloy wheels (which were also polished on some models), a remote vehicle starter system (for vehicles equipped with a four-speed automatic transmission only), a single-pane power moonroof, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, the OnStar in-vehicle telematics system, front side seat-mounted SRS airbags, XM satellite radio, a Bluetooth hands-free telephone system which also included OnStar, and an ABS braking system.\nThe HHR could also be ordered with many luxury amenities (depending upon the trim level selected), such as a power-adjustable front driver's seat, a Pioneer seven-speaker premium audio system with an external amplifier and rear cargo area-mounted subwoofer, luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces with dual heated front seats, front-mounted fog lamps, power-adjustable and heated exterior side mirrors, and a six-disc, in-dash CD/MP3 changer with USB integration.\n\n\n== HHR Panel Van ==\nBetween 2007 and 2011, Chevrolet offered a four-door panel van version of the HHR. Initially offered in LS, 1LT, and 2LT models with either a 2.2-liter or a 2.4-liter EcoTec Inline four-cylinder gasoline engine and a five-speed manual transmission, the HHR Panel Van featured a rear cargo management system in place of the standard HHR's rear split bench seat, deletion of the rear seatbelts and side SRS airbags, a plastic cargo floor in place of the standard HHR's rear carpeting, the deletion of the rear carpeted floor mats (HHR Panel Vans still \nThe following is a list of the longest private passenger vehicles of any global marque sold to individuals.

Marketed by both the Chevrolet and GMC divisions, the C/K series encompassed a wide range of vehicles. While most commonly associated with pickup trucks, the model line also included chassis-cab trucks and medium-duty trucks and served as the basis for GM full-size SUVs. Through its entire production, the model line competed directly against the Ford F-Series and the Dodge D series (later the Dodge Ram pickup).\nUsed for both the model branding and the internal model code, \"C\" denoted two-wheel drive, while \"K\" denoted four-wheel drive. Four generations of the C/K series were produced, including the GM monikered second-generation \"Action Line\" and third-generation \"Rounded Line\" vehicles (colloquially aka Square-Body trucks). For the fourth-generation (colloquially also known as OBS trucks), Chevrolet kept using the C/K designation while GMC revised its branding, changing to a singular GMC Sierra nameplate (C/K remained as an internal model code).\nFor South America, the model line was manufactured by General Motors de Argentina from 1960 to 1978, Sevel Argentina from 1986 to 1991, and General Motors Brazil, who produced versions of the model line for Brazil, Argentina, and Chile from 1964 to 2001.\nAs GM entered the 1990s, the company revised its truck ranges, replacing the medium-duty C/K trucks with the Chevrolet Kodiak/GMC TopKick for 1990. For 1999, GM replaced the fourth-generation C/K pickup trucks with an all-new model line; in line with GMC, Chevrolet dropped the C/K nameplate (in favor of a singular Chevrolet Silverado nameplate). Initially marketed with its successor, the final C/K pickup trucks were produced for the 2000 model year. From 2001 to 2002, the final vehicles of the C/K model line were medium-duty chassis cab trucks.\n\n\n== First generation (1960–1966) ==\n\nLaunched in the fall of 1959 as a 1960 model, the first-generation C/K debuted a number of design changes for General Motors light-truck design. Replacing the Task Force range, the C/K was developed from the start as a truck chassis, no longer sharing commonality with the GM A-body platform. Though developed as a truck for the sake of durability, the C/K adopted several features from cars into its design to increase its functionality. For pickup trucks, the C/K trucks used a drop-center frame which allowed for a lower cab and lower center of gravity, and independent front suspension was paired with a coil-sprung rear axle. For 1963, front torsion bars were replaced by front coil springs (on two-wheel drive vehicles).\nWhile the first generation would not undergo a comprehensive facelift or update, GM would make a series of gradual changes to the model line through its production. For 1962, the hood was redesigned, with a new windshield and A-pillar added to the cab for 1964.\nIn a break from General Motors tradition, this is one of the few generations of trucks not given an in-house moniker. The C/K nomenclature was developed by GMC; \"C\" denoted conventional cab, with \"K\" standing for 4×4 drive.\n\n\n== Second generation (1967–1972) ==\n\nThe second-generation C/K was introduced for the 1967 model year. Designated the \"Action Line\" generation by General Motors, the C/K largely carried over its drop-center ladder frame and its coil-sprung rear axle, but the body was redesigned from the ground up to improve its capability as a multi-purpose vehicle. Alongside a utilitarian vehicle intended for work or farm use, the C/K was also offered with optional features carried over from Chevrolet sedans, including automatic transmissions, AM/FM radio, carpet, and two-tone paint.\nWhile the Action Line would not undergo a definitive model revision through its production, the series underwent gradual changes on a biannual basis. The drivetrain line underwent multiple revisions, as a large-block V8 was offered for the first time in 1968. After 1969, GM switched entire\nThe G-506 trucks, 1+1⁄2-ton, 4x4, produced as the Chevrolet G7100 (and originally G4100) models, were a series of (light) medium four wheel drive trucks used by the United States Army and its allies during and after World War II. This series came in standard cargo, as well as many specialist type bodies.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe G506 was a United States Army Ordnance Corps supply catalog designation for the 1+1⁄2-ton, 4X4, truck chassis built in large numbers by the Chevrolet Motor Division of GM. Their official model numbers were initially the \"G4100\", and later the \"G7100\" series. They became standard 1+1⁄2-ton 4x4 trucks for the US Army and Army Air Corps during World War II.\nDuring World War II, the US military purchased a total of 167,373 four by four 11⁄2-ton trucks, and Chevrolet supplied the great majority of them. According to the 1946 revision of the U.S. military's Summary Report of Acceptances, Tank-Automotive Materiel, Dodge (Fargo) – the initial standard supplier of U.S. 1+1⁄2-ton 4x4 trucks – contributed 6,762 VF model, G-621 series trucks in 1940; and Ford (Marmon-Herrington) and Diamond T supplied another 6,271 and 136 units respectively, leaving 154,204 Chevrolet trucks.\nHowever, some 47,700 of the G7107 and G7117 model trucks were shipped to the Soviet Union as part of the Lend-Lease program. The Soviet Red Army's logistics/transport capabilities improved dramatically in the spring and summer of 1943 largely as a result of the steady supply of American-made trucks (such as Studebaker US6s and the Chevrolet G506s) for the USSR.\n\n\n== Specifications ==\n\n\n=== Engine and driveline ===\n\nThe G506 used a Chevrolet BV-1001-UP, a 235 cu in (3.9 L)\noverhead valve inline-six cylinder gasoline engine developing 83 hp (62 kW) at 3,100 rpm and 184 lbf⋅ft (249 N⋅m) of torque at 1,000 rpm. This is a smaller version of the engine used in the GMC CCKW.\nAll models had a four-speed manual non-synchronized transmission and a two-speed transfer case.\n\n\n=== Chassis ===\n\nThe G506 had a ladder frame with two live beam axles on semi-elliptic leaf springs. GM banjo type axles were used, these axles were also used in later GMC CCKW 2+1⁄2 ton (2,268kg) trucks. There were three wheelbases, 125 in (318 cm) extra short wheelbase used only on the G7128 Bomb servicer, 145 in (368 cm) short wheelbase (a majority of production), and the 175 in (444 cm) long wheelbase. All models had hydraulic brakes with vacuum boost, 7.50-20\" tires and dual rear tires.\n\n\n=== Body ===\nAlmost all G-506s had closed Chevrolet cabs, shared with the closed cab versions of the GMC CCKW – except for three models. A panel van version was built for the Army Signal Corps, open cabs were used on bomb servicers and cab over engine types were used for long-bodied cargo trucks. The pilot models had flat top panels of the front fender, but production trucks had arches over at the fender crowns.\n\n\n== Versions ==\n\nModel G4103 book symbol YK - stake and platform COE, K-33 truck\nModel G4112 book symbol YQ - truck cargo, LWB, 4X4,\nModel G4163 book symbol ZP - truck cargo, W/Winch, 4X4,\nModel G4174 book symbol ZQ - truck cargo, LWB, 4X4,\nModel G7103 book symbol NE - cab\nModel G7105 book symbol NG - panel body, see also K-51, and K-70 van\nModel G7106 book symbol NH - dump body, less winch (9,008 built without a winch)\nModel G7107 book symbol NJ - cargo body, less winch (86,871 built)\nModel G7113 book symbol NK - cab (tractor)\nModel G7116 book symbol NL - dump body, with winch (5,133 built with a winch)\nModel G7117 book symbol NM - cargo body, with winch (26,207 built)\nModel G7127 book symbol NP - truck cargo, LWB (long wheelbase, 383 built)\nModel G7128 book symbol NQ - M6 bomb service truck G35 (extra-short wheelbase, 7,868 built)\nModel G7132 book symbol NN - stake and platform COE, K-54 Truck\nModel G7163 book symbol NR - telephone body, with earth borer, see also K-44 truck\n\nModel G7173 book symbol NS - telephone maintenance body, see also K-43 truck\nArmy Air Force versions\n\nE5 turret t\nThe Chevrolet Express (also known as the GMC Savana) is a series of full-size vans produced by General Motors since 1996. The successor to the Chevrolet G-series van, the Express is produced in passenger and cargo variants. Alongside the standard van body, the line is offered as a cutaway van chassis; the latter vehicle is a chassis cab variant developed for commercial-grade applications, including ambulances, buses, motorhomes, and small trucks.\nIn production for a single generation since 1996, over 2.5 million examples of the Express and the Savana have been produced.  One of the longest-produced designs in American automotive history, the Express/Savana are rivaled only by the Jeep Wagoneer and Dodge Ram Van for longevity.  \nSince 1995, General Motors has assembled the Express and Savana at its Wentzville Assembly facility (Wentzville, Missouri). Also, since 2017, GM has sourced commercial cutaway-chassis production from Navistar through its Springfield Assembly Plant (Springfield, Ohio).\n\n\n== Model history ==\n\n\n=== Pre-facelift (1996–2002) ===\n\nFor the 1996 model year, Chevrolet replaced the G-series Chevrolet Van with the Chevrolet Express (retaining Chevrolet Van for cargo vans).  The first all-new design for the General Motors full-size van line since 1971, the model line was offered in passenger-van and cargo-van variants (the latter initially retained the Chevrolet Van name), with GMC replacing the Vandura/Rally with the Savana. Alongside the first substantial redesign of the model line in 25 years, GM predicted substantial growth in the full-size segment through the end of the 1990s.\nIn a major functional change, the front axle was moved forward 10 inches, effectively moving the front wheels out of the passenger compartment; along with improving front legroom, the design allowed a reduction in step-in height (improving access). While sharing the same engine sizes as the previous model line, the size of the engine cover was reduced, further increasing front passenger space. On all vehicles below 8,500 lbs GVWR (1500 and 2500 series), the Express was introduced with standard dual airbags; for 1997, dual airbags were standardized for all versions of the model line.\nCargo and base models were equipped with a single sealed beam halogen headlamp on each side. The LS trim changed this to a composite headlamp assembly.\nFor 1999, a few minor functional changes were made to the model line. In a more noticeable update, Chevrolet retired the Chevrolet Van nameplate entirely, with the cargo van renamed the Express Cargo Van.\n\n\n=== Facelift (2003–present) ===\n\nFor 2003, the Express and Savana underwent a mid-cycle revision. Alongside substantial frame and chassis upgrades, the bodywork forward of the windshield was revised. Distinguished by a higher hood line, the newer front fascia (developed as an improved crumple zone) was brought closer in line with the GMT800 full-size pickup trucks introduced for 1999; the model line also introduced a degree of parts commonality between the two model lines. The dashboard underwent a redesign; along with the addition of dual-stage airbags, the interior added multiplex wiring (adding increased functionality to the interior electrical system).\nThe Express and Savana offered with 60/40 split panel doors on the passenger-side of the vehicle; in a first (since the Corvair cargo van), an option was added for the driver-side to receive the same split panel doors; this option was limited to the standard-length body (requiring doors on both sides). The option for the driver-side split 60/40 panel doors was available through the 2014 model year.\nSince its 2003 model revision, the Express has seen incremental updates to the model line. The light-duty 2500 vans (below 8,500 pounds GVWR) were discontinued for 2006. For 2008, the Express passenger van received side-curtain airbags and standard stability control (introduced for 3500-series vans for 2005); the steering wheel, seats, and gauge cluster were al\nThe Chevrolet Equinox EV is a battery electric compact crossover SUV  manufactured by General Motors under the Chevrolet brand since 2024. The Equinox EV features a design and underpinnings different from the ICE-powered Equinox. Equinox EV was introduced in January 2022 in a set of images at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) and was originally planned to go on sale in the fall of 2023 for the 2024 model year.  Chevrolet dealers actually began receiving deliveries of the 2024 Equinox EV in May 2024.  \nEquinox EV is built on GM’s BEV3 platform.  For model years 2024 and 2025, Equinox EV uses the CCS1 / J1772 charging interface; for model years 2026 and beyond, the NACS / J3400 charging interface will be used instead.  All of GM’s electric vehicles (except the Spark EV) gained access to the Tesla Supercharger network in September 2024.\n\n\n== 2024 Model Year ==\nDuring its introduction, General Motors stated that Equinox EV would have a starting price of around US$30,000 in the United States and would be offered in various LT and RS trim levels.\nTrim levels were detailed in September 2022. The 2024 base 1LT trim was to have an estimated range of 250 mi (400 km), and produce 210 hp (213 PS; 157 kW) and 242 lb⋅ft (328 N⋅m; 33.5 kg⋅m) torque, but GM never actually produced the 2024 1LT trim.  Non-base 2024 trims were 2LT, 3LT, 2RS and 3RS. \nThe Equinox EV is equipped with GM Ultium batteries which are shared with many other GM battery electric vehicles, including the similar but larger Chevrolet Blazer EV.  A larger battery with 300 mi (480 km) range was to be optional on the 2024 1LT, and standard on 2LT, 3LT, 2RS and 3RS.  For 2025 all trims use this larger battery, which provides an EPA-estimated range of 319 mi (513 km) for all front wheel drive versions.\nAll trim levels have optional all wheel drive, with dual motors producing 290 hp (294 PS; 216 kW) and 346 lb⋅ft (469 N⋅m; 47.8 kg⋅m) torque, with an estimated range of 280 mi (450 km). \nA V2L (vehicle-to-load) system was to be optional for the 2024 3RS trim level. However, GM deferred this capability to the 2025 model year, and as of September 2024 it remains unavailable even on 2025 vehicles.\nCargo space is rated at 57.2 cu ft (1,620 L), which is nearly 7 cubic feet less than the ICE-powered Equinox due to its sleeker exterior design. No front cargo space (\"frunk\") is available as the hood houses propulsion systems and electronic systems instead.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nChevrolet began manufacturing the 2024 Equinox EV in January 2024 at its Ramos Arizpe plant in Mexico.  Chevrolet dealers began receiving deliveries of the 2024 Equinox EV in May 2024. \nIn August 2024, Equinox EV topped Mexico's 2024 EV production with 35,083 units manufactured.\n\n\n== 2025 Model Year ==\nFor the 2025 model year, there are only two trims, LT and RS, each with many available options. \nGM began producing the 2025 model year of Equinox EV on August 26th 2024. \nOn September 11, 2024 the full 2025 Equinox EV MSRP price list was published.\n2025’s Equinox EV provides increased power output: either 220 horsepower and 242 pound-feet of torque (FWD) or 300 horsepower and 348 pound-feet of torque (AWD).\n2025’s Equinox EV also provides increased range & MPGe: either 326 miles with 117 City / 99 Highway / 108 Combined MPGe (FWD) or 307 miles with 112 City / 93 Highway / 103 Combined MPGe (AWD). \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nOfficial press release\nThis is a list of Pontiac vehicles.

Serving as the replacement of the Chevrolet Monza, the Cavalier was the second Chevrolet model line to adopt front-wheel drive. Three versions of the Cavalier have been sold, including three generations sold in North America from  model years 1982 to 2005, a version produced by SAIC-GM for China from 2016 to 2021, and a SAIC-GM version produced for Mexico since the 2019 model year.\nThe Cavalier was among the inaugural vehicles of the GM J platform.  One of the first \"world cars\" of General Motors, the J platform was developed for use by each North American GM division (with the exception of GMC), alongside international models for Opel, Vauxhall, and Holden. Though sharing chassis underpinnings, J-body cars from Europe and Australia used slightly different body designs and different powertrains; in Europe, the Vauxhall Cavalier and Opel Ascona were marketed as mid-size cars.  Initially a divisional counterpart of the Buick Skyhawk, Cadillac Cimarron, Oldsmobile Firenza, and Pontiac J2000, the Cavalier was primarily marketed alongside the Pontiac Sunbird (renamed the Pontiac Sunfire for 1995).\nThe 1982–2005 Cavalier was produced by multiple GM facilities across North America; all models from the 1990s on were made at Lordstown Assembly, which became synonymous with the Cavalier and compact Chevrolet modes in general from the earlier Chevrolet Vega all the way to the Chevrolet Cruze. For 2005, the Chevrolet Cobalt replaced the model line in North America.\n\n\n== Predecessors ==\nThe Cavalier began development in the late 1970s, as Chevrolet sought to replace the compact Monza with a front-wheel drive model line sized between the Chevrolet Chevette subcompact and the front-wheel drive Nova replacement (which was renamed the Chevrolet Citation for production). Serving as a replacement for the Vega, the Monza was offered as a 2-door notchback coupe, 3-door hatchback, and 3-door station wagon (sharing the body of the Vega wagon).  Initially developed for the stillborn GM Wankel rotary engine, the rear-wheel drive Monza was reengineered to accommodate V6 and V8 engines up to 350 cu in (5.7 L).\nMarketed as one of the smallest and lowest-price American cars, the Chevette hatchback was closer in size to the Volkswagen Beetle, competing primarily against subcompacts from Japanese-brand manufacturers, including the Honda Civic, Datsun B210 and Toyota Corolla. Following the introduction of the Dodge Omni and Ford Fiesta, American manufacturers began transitioning towards front-wheel drive in compacts and subcompacts, through both domestically produced vehicles and the use of captive imports.\nAlong with developing up-to-date chassis underpinnings to replace the Monza, GM sought to expand the market appeal of the new model line by expanding the number of available body styles.  The notchback coupe and three-door hatchback would make a return, joined by a four-door sedan and five-door station wagon (two body styles offered in mid-size and full-size Chevrolets).\n\n\n== First generation (1982–1987) ==\n\nThe first-generation Cavalier first went on sale in the United States in May 1981 as a 1982 model. The Cavalier name originated from GM's then-British subsidiary Vauxhall, who applied it to badge engineered variants of the Opel Ascona, the third generation of which was the first J-body car to be released.\nInitially, the 1.8 liter carbureted L46 inline 4 was the only available engine, and it could be mated to either a 4-speed manual or a 3-speed automatic transmission. The Cavalier came in four body styles: a 2-door coupe, 3-door hatchback, 4-door sedan, and a 4-door station wagon. Available trim packages were the entry level Cadet, mid-level Base, and the upscale CL, which could be optioned with two-tone paint, accent stripes, and aluminum alloy wheels. The suspension was shared with the Citation and Celebrity, and consisted of MacPherson struts, lower control arms, coil springs, \nThe second generation of the C/K series is a range of trucks that was manufactured by General Motors. Marketed by both the Chevrolet and GMC divisions from the 1967 to 1972 model years, this generation was given the \"Action Line\" moniker by General Motors (the first-generation C/K did not receive such a name). As with its predecessor, the second generation C/K included full-size pickup trucks, chassis cab trucks, and medium-duty commercial trucks.\nThe Action Line C/K marked the expansion of the General Motors utility vehicle range, as the Chevrolet Suburban (GMC Carryall) utility wagon was joined by the Chevrolet K5 Blazer (GMC Jimmy) off-road vehicle. A shorter-wheelbase version of the K-series pickup truck, the open-top Blazer/Jimmy was among the first widely produced sport-utility vehicles. This generation marked the debut of the Chevrolet Cheyenne and GMC Sierra nameplates; making their debuts as trim levels, the Cheyenne and Sierra are both used by GM to this day in current production.\nProduced by multiple sites across the United States and Canada, the model line was also produced in South America.\n\n\n== Model history ==\nThe second-generation C/K was produced from the 1967 to the 1972 model years. Alongside multiple updates resulting from changes in federal regulations, the Action-Line trucks underwent a mid-cycle revision for the 1971 model year.\n\n\n=== 1967-1970 ===\nFor 1967, the C/K series underwent a ground-up redesign as GM better adapted the model line towards multi-purpose use; along with improving durability and capability, comfort and convenience features were also increased to improve its effectiveness as a personal-use vehicle. For the pickup trucks, this was the final year of two rear window sizes available, including a small rear window (standard, shared with medium-duty trucks) and wider \"full-view\" window (optional for pickup trucks and chassis cabs).\nFor 1968, Chevrolet celebrated its 50th year as a truck manufacturer; to commemorate the anniversary, a 50th Anniversary Package (featuring an exclusive white-gold-white paint scheme) was offered as an option. On all pickup trucks, the larger \"full-view\" rear window became standard (with the smaller design remaining on medium-duty trucks). Following their requirement by the U.S. government, side-marker lights were added to all four corners. In a minor revision, GMC shifted its emblem from the grille to the hood. On 3⁄4-ton C-series trucks, GM introduced the Longhorn option, including an 81⁄2-foot Fleetside/Wideside pickup bed.\nFor 1969, the interior underwent some component changes, adopting a foot-operated parking brake and a redesigned steering wheel; a two-spoke design (with a plastic horn button) replaced the previous three-spoke design (with a chrome horn button). On the exterior, the hood was redesigned with a blunter front end; Chevrolet trucks received a redesigned grille. Upper and lower side moldings were introduced alongside additional two-tone paint configurations; standard on CST-trim (GMC Super Custom) trucks, the side moldings were optional on any other trim levels. GMC introduced the Sierra and Sierra Grande option packages, making them distinct trim levels for 1972.\nFor 1970, Action-Line trucks saw little change, with the Chevrolet grille receiving a minor revision.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 1971 model update ===\n\nFor the 1971 model year, the Action-Line C/K underwent a mid-cycle revision, distinguished by updated front fascias for both Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks. Chevrolets received an eggcrate grille design (with the Chevrolet bowtie emblem returning to the grille); GMC grilles shared the stamping as before, styled with additional blacked-out trim. In a chassis upgrade, all light-duty C/K trucks received front disc brakes as standard equipment. The interior underwent upgrades, introducing an optional tilt steering column for the automatic and 4-speed manual transmissions. Following its usage in Chevrol\nThe Chevrolet Equinox is a crossover SUV introduced by Chevrolet in 2004 for the 2005 model year. It was intended to replace the North American Chevrolet Tracker and Chevrolet S-10 Blazer. The third-generation Equinox also replaced the first-generation Chevrolet Captiva.\nAn all-electric battery-powered (BEV) version called the Equinox EV was introduced in 2022 with sales starting in 2023 for the 2024 model year. It adopts a separate design and underpinnings from the internal combustion engine powered Equinox.\n\n\n== First generation (2005) ==\n\nThe Chevrolet Equinox was introduced in 2004 at the 2003 North American International Auto Show for the 2005 model year; its mechanical twin, the Pontiac Torrent, was introduced in 2005 at the 2005 Los Angeles Auto Show for the 2006 model year. A unique feature on the Equinox was its sliding rear bench seat dubbed \"Multi-Flex\".\nRiding on the GM Theta platform, the unibody is mechanically similar to the Saturn Vue and the Suzuki XL7. However, the Equinox and the Torrent are larger than the Vue, riding on a 112.5 in (2,858 mm) wheelbase, 5.9 in (150 mm) longer than the Vue. Front-wheel drive is standard, with optional all-wheel drive. They are not designed for off-roading unlike the truck-based Chevrolet Tahoe and TrailBlazer.\nFor the 2006 model year, GM updated the Equinox for the first time, adding GM badges on the front doors, as well as recoloring the dashboard panel from grey to black. Heated seats became available with the cloth interior, and the rear seats now featured smaller headrests for improved rear visibility. The transmission shifter knob and HVAC controls were also updated. Outside, LS models now featured a standard body-color front bumper (instead of black), while LT models now featured body-color outside mirrors.\nThe Equinox and Torrent received several interior and mechanical updates for 2007. The instrument cluster was redesigned with a trip computer display, replacing the Saturn-sourced unit. There were also some mechanical updates: the gear ratios of the five-speed transmission were revised for improved fuel economy, brakes now have rear vented discs instead of drums, and the fuel tank size is now 20.5 US gallons (on FWD) or 16.6 US gallons (on AWD), instead of the previous 17-US-gallon size on both models.\nThe first-generation Equinox and Torrent were produced exclusively at the CAMI Automotive GM/Suzuki joint venture plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, Canada. The 3.4 L LNJ V6 engine is made in China (by Shanghai GM), while the Aisin AF33 transmission is made in Japan. Starting with the 2008 model year, the Equinox Sport and Torrent GXP were available with a 3.6-liter DOHC V6 engine that was made in the United States.\nProduction ended in May 2009.\nThe Chevrolet Equinox was not sold in Mexico during the 2009 model year.\n\n\n=== Pontiac Torrent ===\n\nWhile the Torrent shares its basic body structure and mechanicals with the Equinox, it does have a different front and rear styling.\nThe Torrent was discontinued after the 2009 model year as part of the discontinuation of the Pontiac brand, with the last one rolling off the assembly line on September 2, 2009. A Buick Theta crossover SUV was to be made, effectively taking place of the Pontiac Torrent. Instead, GM replaced the Torrent with the GMC Terrain, which shares the Theta platform with the second-generation Equinox.\n\n\n=== Engines ===\n\n\n=== Sport trims ===\n\nFor the 2008 and 2009 model years, GM offered different versions of the Equinox and Torrent; called Sport and GXP, respectively. Featuring a 3.6-liter LY7 DOHC V6 engine and a 6-speed automatic transmission (with Manual Tap Up/Down shifting capability). This larger and more powerful (264 hp (197 kW; 268 PS) or 40% increase) engine allowed acceleration from 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) in under seven seconds.\nThese models also received a 1 in (25 mm) lowered ride height with a performance-tuned suspension and unique front and rear body kits. The lower stance is accented by the 18-\nThe Chevrolet Impala () is a full-size car that was built by Chevrolet for model years 1958 to 1985, 1994 to 1996, and 2000 to 2020. The Impala was Chevrolet's popular flagship passenger car and was among the better-selling American-made automobiles in the United States.\nFor its debut in 1958, the Impala was distinguished from other models by its symmetrical triple taillights. The Chevrolet Caprice was introduced as a top-line Impala Sport Sedan for model year 1965, later becoming a separate series positioned above the Impala in 1966, which, in turn, remained above the Chevrolet Bel Air and the Chevrolet Biscayne. The Impala continued as Chevrolet's most popular full-sized model through the mid-1980s. Between 1994 and 1996, the Impala was revised as a 5.7-liter V8–powered version of the Chevrolet Caprice Classic sedan.\nIn 2000, the Impala was reintroduced again as a mainstream front-wheel drive car. In February 2014, the 2014 Impala ranked No. 1 among Affordable Large Cars in U.S. News & World Report's rankings. When the 10th generation of the Impala was introduced for the 2014 model year, the 9th generation was rebadged as the Impala Limited and sold only to fleet customers through 2016. During that time, both versions were sold in the United States and Canada. The 10th-generation Impala was also sold in the Middle East and South Korea.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nThe Impala name was first used for the full-sized 1956 General Motors Motorama show car that bore Corvette-like design cues, especially the grille. It was named Impala after the graceful African antelope, which was used as the car's logo. Painted emerald green metallic, with a white interior, the Impala concept car featured hardtop styling. Clare MacKichan's design team, along with designers from Pontiac, started to establish basic packaging and dimensions for their shared 1958 General Motors \"A\" body in June. The first styling sketch that directly influenced the finished Chevrolet automobile was seen by General Motors Styling Vice President Harley Earl in October. Seven months later, the basic design was developed.\n\n\n== First generation (1958) ==\n\nFor 1958, GM was promoting its 50th year of production, and introduced anniversary models for each brand; Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Chevrolet. The 1958 models shared a common appearance on the top models for each brand; Cadillac Eldorado Seville, Buick Limited Riviera, Oldsmobile Starfire 98, Pontiac Bonneville Catalina, and the Chevrolet Bel-Air Impala.\nThe Impala was introduced for the 1958 model year as a top-of-the-line Bel Air in 2-door hardtops and convertibles. From the windshield (A) pillar rearward, the 1958 Bel Air Impala differed structurally from the lower-priced Chevrolet models. Hardtops had a slightly shorter greenhouse and longer rear deck. The wheelbase of the Impala was longer than the lower-priced models, although the overall length was identical. Interiors held a two-spoke steering wheel and color-keyed door panels with brushed aluminum trim. No other series included a convertible.\nThe 1958 Chevrolet models were longer, lower, and wider than their predecessors. The 1958 model year was the first with dual headlamps. The tailfins of the 1957 were replaced by deeply sculptured rear fenders. Impalas had three taillights each side, while lesser models had two and wagons just one. The Impalas included crossed-flag insignias above the side moldings, as well as bright rocker moldings and dummy rear-fender scoops.\nThe standard perimeter-type frame was abandoned, replaced by a unit with rails laid out in the form of an elongated \"X\". Chevrolet claimed that the new frame offered increased torsional rigidity and allowed for a lower placement of the passenger compartment. This was a transitional step between traditional construction and the later fully unitized body/chassis; the body structure was also strengthened in the rocker panels and firewall. However, this frame was not as effective in protecting the inte",

GMC brought out its version in 1937. These vehicles were also known as the \"Suburban Carryall\" until GM shortened the name to simply \"Suburban.\" GMC's equivalent to the Chevrolet model was originally named \"Suburban\" as well, until being rebranded as \"Yukon XL\" for the 2000 model year."

Replacing the Task Force range, the C/K was developed from the start as a truck chassis, no longer sharing commonality with the GM A-body platform. Though developed as a truck for the sake of durability, the C/K adopted several features from cars into its design to increase its functionality. For pickup trucks, the C/K trucks used a drop-center frame which allowed for a lower cab and lower center of gravity, and independent front suspension was paired with a coil-sprung rear axle. For 1963, front torsion bars were replaced by front coil springs (on two-wheel drive vehicles).\nWhile the first generation would not undergo a comprehensive facelift or update, GM would make a series of gradual changes to the model line through its production. For 1962, the hood was redesigned, with a new windshield and A-pillar added to the cab for 1964."
