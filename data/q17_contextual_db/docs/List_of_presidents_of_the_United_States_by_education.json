{"page_content": "Most presidents of the United States received a college education, even most of the earliest. Of the first seven presidents, five were college graduates. College degrees have set the presidents apart from the general population, and presidents have held degrees even though it was quite rare and unnecessary for practicing most occupations, including law. Of the 45 individuals to have been the president, 24 graduated from a private undergraduate college, 9 graduated from a public undergraduate college, and 12 held no degree.  Every president since 1953 has had a bachelor's degree, reflecting the increasing importance of higher education in the United States.\n\n\n== List by university attended ==\n\n\n=== Did not graduate from college ===\nGeorge Washington (The death of Washington's father ended his formal schooling. The College of William & Mary issued surveying licenses in Virginia, and Washington received his license from the College in 1749 \u2014 surveyors did not attend classes at the school. Washington believed strongly in formal education, and his will left money and/or stocks to support three educational institutions, including George Washington University and Washington and Lee University)\nJames Monroe (attended the College of William and Mary, but dropped out to fight in the Revolutionary War)\nAndrew Jackson\nMartin Van Buren\nWilliam Henry Harrison (attended Hampden Sydney College for three years but did not graduate and then attended University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine but never received a degree)\nZachary Taylor\nMillard Fillmore (founded the University at Buffalo)\nAbraham Lincoln (had only about a year of formal schooling of any kind)\nAndrew Johnson  (no formal schooling of any kind)\nGrover Cleveland\nWilliam McKinley (attended Allegheny College, but did not graduate; also attended Albany Law School, but also did not graduate)\nHarry S. Truman (went to business college and law school, but did not graduate)\n\n\n=== Undergraduate ===\n\n\n==== Additional undergraduate information ====\nSome presidents attended more than one institution. George Washington never attended college, though The College of William & Mary did issue him a surveyor's certificate. One president attended a foreign college at the undergraduate level: John Quincy Adams at Leiden University (John F. Kennedy intended to study at the London School of Economics, but failed to attend as he fell ill before classes began.) Bill Clinton won a Rhodes Scholarship, enrolling at the University of Oxford in Fall 1968, where he read for a B.Phil in politics. He left Oxford without earning a degree in order to enroll at Yale Law School.   \nThree presidents have attended the United States Service academies: Ulysses S. Grant and Dwight D. Eisenhower graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, while Jimmy Carter graduated from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. No presidents have graduated from the United States Coast Guard Academy or the much newer U.S. Air Force Academy.  Eisenhower also graduated from the Army Command and General Staff College, Army Industrial College and Army War College. These were not degree-granting institutions when Eisenhower attended, but were part of his professional education as a career soldier.\n\n\n=== Graduate school ===\nA total of 20 presidents attended some form of graduate school (including professional schools). Among them, eleven presidents received a graduate degree during their lifetimes; two more received graduate degrees posthumously.\n\n\n==== Business school ====\n\n\n==== Graduate school ====\n\n\n==== Medical school ====\n\n\n==== Law school ====\n\nSeveral presidents who were lawyers did not attend law school, but became lawyers after independent study under the tutelage of established attorneys. Some had attended college before beginning their legal studies, and several studied law without first having attended college.  Presidents who were lawyers but did not attend law school include: John Adams; Thomas\nMost vice presidents of the United States have undergone higher education at an American university, college or law school.\n\n\n== List ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of presidents of the United States by education\n\n\n== References ==\nReligious affiliations can affect the electability of the presidents of the United States and shape their stances on policy matters and their visions of society and also how they want to lead it. While no president has ever openly identified as an atheist, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and William Howard Taft were speculated to be atheists by their opponents during political campaigns; in addition, a survey during the presidency of Donald Trump showed that 63% of Americans did not believe he was religious, despite his professed Christian affiliation. Trump supporters have also circulated conspiracy theories that Barack Obama is a Muslim. Conversely, other presidents, such as Jimmy Carter, have used their faith as a defining aspect of their campaigns and tenure in office.\nEssentially all of the presidents can be characterized as Christians, at least by upbringing, though some were unaffiliated with any specific religious body. Mainline Protestants predominate, with Episcopalians and Presbyterians being the most prevalent. John F. Kennedy was the first Catholic president, and Joe Biden, the current president, is the second.\n\n\n== Formal affiliation ==\nThe pattern of religious adherence has changed dramatically over the course of United States history, so that the pattern of presidential affiliations is quite unrepresentative of modern membership numbers. For example, Episcopalians are extraordinarily well represented among the presidents compared to a current membership of about 2% of the population; this is partly because the Church of England, from which the Episcopal Church is derived, was the established church in some of the British Colonies (such as New York and Virginia) before the American Revolution. The Episcopal Church has been much larger previously, with its decline in membership occurring only in more recent decades. The first seven presidents listed as Episcopalians were all from Virginia. Unitarians are also overrepresented, reflecting the importance of those colonial churches. Conversely, Baptists are underrepresented, a reflection of their quite recent expansion in numbers; the list includes only two Catholic presidents including the current president, although they are currently the largest single denomination. There have been no Adventist, Anabaptist, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, Latter Day Saint, or Pentecostal presidents.\nWhile many presidents did not formally join a church until quite late in life, there is a genre of tales of deathbed conversions. Biographers usually doubt these, though the baptism of James K. Polk is well documented.\n\n\n== Personal beliefs ==\nOn the other hand, there are several presidents who considered themselves aligned with a particular church, but who withheld from formal affiliation for a time. James Buchanan, for instance, held himself allied with the Presbyterian church, but refrained from joining it until he left office.\n\n\n=== Deism and the Founding Fathers ===\nDeism was a religious philosophy in common currency in colonial times, and some Founding Fathers (most notably Thomas Paine, who was an explicit proponent of it, and Benjamin Franklin, who spoke of it in his Autobiography) are identified more or less with this system. Thomas Jefferson became a deist in later life, and George Washington, James Madison, James Monroe, and John Tyler are often identified as having some degree of deistic beliefs.\n\n\n=== Unitarianism and Nontrinitarianism ===\nFour presidents are affiliated with Unitarian churches (not to be confused with Unitarian Universalism), and a fifth (Jefferson) was an exponent of ideas now commonly associated with Unitarianism. Unitarians fall outside of Trinitarian Christianity, and the question arises as to the degree to which the presidents themselves held Christian precepts. The information is generally available in the statements of the presidents themselves; for example, John Quincy Adams left detailed statements of his beliefs. William Howard Taft, a Unitarian, \nThis is a complete list of Philippine presidents by college education that consists of the 17 heads of state in the history of the Philippines. \nAlmost all presidents (except Emilio Aguinaldo, Joseph Estrada, and Bongbong Marcos) completed a college degree program. College and postgraduate education have prepared presidents in their future roles as heads of state, architects of foreign policy, commanders-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and managers of the entire government bureaucracy. \nBy law, under the Constitution of the Philippines, any Filipino citizen aged forty and above who can read and write and can meet residency requirements is eligible to run as president. However, in practice, popularity, political machinery, and financial resources are the key elements leading to a successful presidential candidate.\n\n\n== List by degree ==\nThis section lists presidents according to schools from which they earned degrees. Schools that presidents attended but did not earn degrees from are not included.\n\n\n=== Did not graduate from college ===\nEmilio Aguinaldo (A cholera epidemic forced the Colegio de San Juan de Letran where Aguinaldo attended the equivalent of high school to close in 1880. Aguinaldo never returned to any form of schooling following this closure.)\nJoseph Estrada (Estrada attended Map\u00faa Institute of Technology before transferring to Polytechnic Colleges of the Philippines, where he later dropped out.)\nBongbong Marcos (Marcos attended the Center for Research and Communication, where he took a special diploma course in economics, but did not finish. He also attended St Edmund Hall at the University of Oxford, studying philosophy, politics and economics (PPE). However, despite his claims that he graduated with a bachelor of arts in PPE, he did not obtain such a degree. Marcos had passed philosophy, but failed economics, and failed politics twice, thus making him ineligible for a degree. Instead, he received a special diploma in social studies, which was awarded mainly to non-graduates and is currently no longer offered by the university.)\n\n\n=== LL.B. ===\nThe J.D. was first conferred in the Philippines in lieu of the LL.B. by the Ateneo Law School in 1990, with the model program later adopted by most schools now offering the J.D. However, no president as of yet has graduated with the J.D., as all have earned the LL.B. prior to 1990.\n\n\n=== Master's ===\n\n\n=== Ph.D. ===\n\n\n=== Undergraduate ===\nSome presidents attended more than one institution, though only those from which they earned undergraduate degrees are included here.  Two presidents never earned undergraduate degrees: Emilio Aguinaldo never attended college, while Joseph Estrada dropped out from both colleges that he attended. One, Bongbong Marcos, did not finish his special diploma course at the Center for Research and Communication and received only a special diploma in social studies from the University of Oxford as he failed two components of his program of study, making him ineligible to receive an undergraduate degree. Marcos still falsely claims that he obtained a degree from Oxford despite Oxford confirming in 2015 and 2021 that Marcos did not finish his degree.\nThree presidents attended foreign colleges at the undergraduate level: Corazon Aquino, Fidel Ramos, and Bongbong Marcos. One president attended a United States service academy: Fidel Ramos graduated from the United States Military Academy as part of his professional education as a career soldier.\n\n\n== List by specialization ==\n\n\n=== Business school ===\n\n\n=== Law school ===\n\n\n== List by presidents ==\n\n\n== Other academic associations ==\n\n\n=== Faculty member ===\n\n\n=== School rector or president ===\n\n\n=== School trustee or governor ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nEducation in the Philippines\nList of prime ministers of Australia by education\nList of prime ministers of New Zealand by education\nList of prime ministers of Canada by academic degrees\nList of prime ministers of the United Kin\nListed below are the private residences of the various presidents of the United States. Except for George Washington all of them also lived at the White House (Executive Residence). For a list of official residences, see President of the United States \u00a7 Residence.\n\n\n== Private homes of the presidents ==\n\nThis is a list of notable homes where presidents resided with their families before or after their term of office.\n\n\n== Presidential vacation homes ==\nDuring their term of office, many presidents have owned or leased vacation homes in various parts of the country, which are often called by journalists the \"Western White House\", \"Summer White House\", or \"Winter White House\", depending on location or season.\n\n\n=== Summer White House ===\nThe \"Summer White House\" is typically the name given to the summer vacation residence of the sitting president of the United States aside from Camp David, the mountain-based military camp in Frederick County, Maryland, used as a country retreat and for high-alert protection of presidents and their guests.\n\n\n=== Winter White House ===\nA \"Winter White House\" is typically the name given to the winter vacation residence of the standing president of the United States aside from Camp David, the mountain-based military camp in Frederick County, Maryland, used as a country retreat and for high-alert protection of the president and his guests.\nAlthough Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy had spent significant time in Florida (Harry Truman having spent time there in the summer), Richard Nixon's Florida White House was the first that reporters called the \"Winter White House\".\n\n\n=== Western/Southern White House ===\n\nThe Western White House and Southern White House are terms sometimes applied to additional residences of the president, especially when those residences are very distant from the District of Columbia. Famous examples include Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, as well as George W. Bush's Prairie Chapel Ranch in Crawford, Texas; Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan have also used the term for their private residences (Nixon and Reagan in California, Johnson in Texas).\n\n\n=== Other secondary \"White Houses\" ===\nThe first governmental spending on property improvements of private presidential residences was at Dwight Eisenhower's Gettysburg farm, where the Secret Service added three guard posts to a fence. Federal law now allows the president to designate a residence outside of the White House as his temporary offices, so that federal money can be used to provide required facilities.\n\n\n== Other official residences occupied by presidents ==\n\n\n=== Official residences occupied while in other offices ===\nThis is a list of official residences occupied by individuals who later served as presidents with their families while they served in the office related to the residence.\n\n\n=== Official residences occupied by presidents while another member of their family served in other offices ===\nThis is a list of official residences occupied by presidents with their families (before or after their term of office) while another member of their family served in the office related to the residence.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nPresidential memorials in the United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPresidentialMuseums.com \u2013 Presidential museums, libraries, birthplaces, centers, and other notable places of historic importance.\nDiscover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary: American Presidents: List of Sites \u2013 National Park Service\nOf the 45 persons who have served as President of the United States, at least half have displayed proficiency in speaking or writing a language other than English. Of these, only one, Martin Van Buren, learned English as his second language; his first language was Dutch. Four of the earliest presidents were multilingual, with John Quincy Adams and Thomas Jefferson demonstrating proficiency in a number of foreign languages.\nJames A. Garfield and his successor Chester A. Arthur knew Ancient Greek and Latin, but it was Garfield's ambidexterity that would lead to rumors that he could write both at the same time. Both Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke French, and Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke German. As for Asian languages, James Madison studied Hebrew, Herbert Hoover spoke some Mandarin Chinese, while Barack Obama spoke Indonesian fluently as a child.\n\n\n== 18th century ==\n\n\n=== John Adams ===\nJohn Adams, the second president of the United States, learned to read Latin at a young age. In preparation for attending Harvard University, Adams attended a school for improving his Latin skills. While posted in France during the Revolutionary War, Adams became fluent in French.\n\n\n== 19th century ==\n\n\n=== Thomas Jefferson ===\nThomas Jefferson spoke and read multiple languages, which included French. According to notes he made while traveling in 1788, he was able to speak French, Latin, and Italian. He claimed to be able to read, as of 1817, these languages along with Greek and Spanish. He also studied and wrote about the Anglo-Saxon language (Old English) and studied German to some extent. After his death, a number of other books, dictionaries, and grammar manuals in various languages were found in Jefferson's library, suggesting that he studied additional languages, possibly including Arabic, Irish, and Welsh. His proficiency in these languages is not known.\nRegarding Spanish, Jefferson told John Quincy Adams that he had learned the language over the course of nineteen days while sailing from the United States to France. He had borrowed a Spanish grammar and a copy of Don Quixote from a friend and read them on the voyage. Adams expressed skepticism, noting Jefferson's tendency to tell \"large stories.\"\n\n\n=== James Madison ===\nJames Madison began his studies of Latin at the age of twelve and had mastered Greek, Latin, Italian, and French (the last reportedly with a Scottish accent) by the time he entered the College of New Jersey, later Princeton University. He produced many translations of Latin orations of Grotius, Pufendorf, and Vattel. He also studied Horace and Ovid. He learned Greek as an admissions requirement for higher college learning.\nWhile in college, Madison learned to speak and read Hebrew. When he could have graduated, Madison remained at college for an additional year to study ethics and Hebrew in greater depth.\n\n\n=== James Monroe ===\nJames Monroe was enrolled in the best school in the colony of Virginia, which is why Monroe was later able to immediately take advanced courses in Latin at the College of William & Mary.\nJames Monroe adopted many French customs while a diplomat in Paris, including learning fluent French. The entire Monroe family knew the language, and often spoke it with one another at home.\n\n\n=== John Quincy Adams ===\nJohn Quincy Adams went to school in both France and the Netherlands, and spoke fluent French and conversational Dutch. Adams strove to improve his abilities in Dutch throughout his life, and at times translated a page of Dutch a day to help improve his mastery of the language. Official documents that he translated were sent to the Secretary of State of the United States, so that Adams' studies would serve a useful purpose as well. When his father appointed him United States Ambassador to Prussia, Adams dedicated himself to becoming proficient in German in order to have the tools to strengthen relations between the two countries. He improved his skills by translating article\nIn political studies, surveys have been conducted in order to construct historical rankings of the success of the presidents of the United States. Ranking systems are usually based on surveys of academic historians and political scientists or popular opinion. The scholarly rankings focus on presidential achievements, leadership qualities, failures, and faults.\nPopular-opinion polls typically focus on recent or well-known presidents. \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nA 1948 poll was conducted by historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr. of Harvard University. A 1962 survey was also conducted by Schlesinger, who surveyed 75 historians. Schlesinger's son, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., conducted another poll in 1996.\nThe Chicago Tribune surveyed  49 historians in 1982.\nThe Siena College Research Institute has conducted surveys in 1982, 1990, 1994, 2002, 2010, 2018 and 2022 \u2013 during the second year of the first term of each president since Ronald Reagan. These surveys collect presidential rankings from historians, political scientists, and presidential scholars in a range of attributes, abilities, and accomplishments. The 1994 survey placed only two presidents, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln, above 80 points and two presidents, Andrew Johnson and Warren G. Harding, below 50 points.\nIn 1996, William J. Ridings Jr. and Stuart B. McIver conducted and published a poll and in 1997, an accompanying book on the poll results. 719 people took part in the poll, primarily academic historians and political scientists, although some politicians and celebrities also took part. Participants from every state were included and emphasis was placed upon getting input from female historians and \"specialists in African American studies\" as well as a few non-American historians. Poll respondents rated the presidents in five categories (leadership qualities, accomplishments, crisis management, political skill, appointments, and character and integrity) and the results were tabulated to create the overall ranking.\n\n\n=== 2000\u20132017 ===\nA 2005 presidential poll was conducted by James Lindgren for the Federalist Society and The Wall Street Journal. As in the 2000 survey, the editors sought to balance the opinions of liberals and conservatives, adjusting the results \"to give Democratic- and Republican-leaning scholars equal weight\". Franklin D. Roosevelt still ranked in the top three, but editor James Taranto noted that Democratic-leaning scholars rated George W. Bush the sixth-worst president of all time while Republican scholars rated him the sixth-best, giving him a split-decision rating of \"average\".\nIn 2008, The Times daily newspaper of London asked eight of its own \"top international and political commentators\" to rank all 42 presidents \"in order of greatness\".\nThe C-SPAN Survey of Presidential Leadership consists of rankings from a group of presidential historians and biographers. The C-SPAN Survey of Presidential Leadership has taken place four times: in 2000, 2009, 2017, and 2021. The 2021 survey was of 142 presidential historians, surveyed by C-SPAN's Academic Advisor Team, made up of Douglas G. Brinkley, Edna Greene Medford, Richard Norton Smith, and Amity Shlaes. In the survey, each historian rates each president on a scale of one (\"not effective\") to 10 (\"very effective\") on presidential leadership in ten categories: Public Persuasion, Crisis Leadership, Economic Management, Moral Authority, International Relations, Administrative Skills, Relations with Congress, Vision/Setting An Agenda, Pursued Equal Justice for All and Performance Within the Context of His Times\u2014with each category equally weighed. The results of all four C-SPAN surveys have been fairly consistent. Abraham Lincoln has taken the highest ranking in each survey and George Washington, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Theodore Roosevelt have always ranked in the top five while James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson, and Franklin Pierce have been ranked at the bottom of all four surveys.\nTh\nThis is a list of vice presidents of the United States by other offices (either elected or appointive) held, either before or after service as the vice president.\n\n\n== Federal government ==\n\n\n=== Executive branch ===\n\n\n==== President ====\n\n\n==== Cabinet secretaries ====\n\n\n==== Ambassadors ====\n\n\n==== Other federal appointees ====\n\n\n=== Judicial branch ===\nNo vice presidents have yet served in the judicial branch.\n\n\n=== Legislative branch ===\n\n\n==== Senators ====\n\nA number of future and former vice presidents served together while in the Senate:\n\nKing served with R.

Hamlin later served with Wilson (1855\u20131861; 1869\u20131873) and A. Johnson (1857\u20131861; 1875). Wilson and A. Johnson, during their continued service with each other (1861\u20131862), also served with Breckinridge (1861). Wilson also served with Hendricks (1863\u20131869).\nCurtis served with Barkley (1927\u20131929). Barkley later served with Truman (1935\u20131945), Humphrey (1955\u20131956) and L. Johnson (1955\u20131956). Humphrey and L. Johnson, who had served together before and after their service with Barkley (1949\u20131961), also served with Nixon (1950\u20131953). Humphrey would be succeeded by Mondale and would later serve with him (1971\u20131976) and Biden (1973\u20131978). Biden later served with Quayle (1981\u20131989) and Gore (1985\u20131993).\n\n\n==== Members of the House of Representatives ====\n\nA number of future vice presidents served in the House together:\n\nR.

The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.\nThe power of the presidency has grown substantially since the first president, George Washington, took office in 1789. While presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasingly significant role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, carrying over into the 21st century with notable expansions during the presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and George W. Bush. In modern times, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures and the leader of the world's only remaining superpower. As the leader of the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP, the president possesses significant domestic and international hard and soft power. For much of the 20th century, especially during the Cold War, the U.S. president was often called \"the leader of the free world\".\nArticle II of the Constitution establishes the executive branch of the federal government and vests executive power in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers.  Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy. The role includes responsibility for directing the world's most expensive military, which has the second-largest nuclear arsenal.\nThe president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of separation of powers, Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or veto federal legislation. Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent on the president. In recent decades, presidents have also made increasing use of executive orders, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to shape domestic policy.\nThe president is elected indirectly through the Electoral College to a four-year term, along with the vice president. Under the Twenty-second Amendment, ratified in 1951, no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. In addition, nine vice presidents have become president by virtue of a president's intra-term death or resignation. In all, 45 individuals have served 46 presidencies spanning 58 four-year terms. Joe Biden is the 46th and current president, having assumed office on January 20, 2021.\n\n\n== History and development ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, the Thirteen Colonies, represented by the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, declared themselves to be independent sovereign states and no longer under British rule. The affirmation was made in the Declaration of Independence, which was written predominantly by Thomas Jefferson and adopted unanimously on July 4, 1776, by the Second Continental Congress. Recognizing the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the British, the Continental Congress simultaneously began the process of drafting a constitution that would bind the states together. There were long debates on a number of issues, including representation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central government. Congress finished work on the Articles of Confederation to establish a perpetual union between the states in November 1777 and sent \nPresidents of the United States have often acquired nicknames, both flattering and unflattering.

Three attended the University of Edinburgh, three the University of Glasgow,  two Mason Science College, a predecessor institution of the University of Birmingham, and one - the incumbent prime minister Keir Starmer - the University of Leeds. John Major was (as of 2024) the last of the eight prime ministers who did not attend university after leaving secondary education. A number of the prime ministers who attended university never graduated. Oxford gained its 29th prime-ministerial alumnus when Liz Truss  succeeded Boris Johnson in September 2022, and its 30th - and fifth consecutive - a month later in Rishi Sunak. Starmer followed his undergraduate degree at Leeds with a postgraduate Bachelor of Civil Law degree at Oxford.\nTwenty prime ministers were schooled at Eton College, of whom nine were educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, including all three who held office between 1880 and 1902 (Gladstone, Salisbury, Rosebery). Seven were educated at Harrow School and six at Westminster School. Rishi Sunak was the second to be educated at Winchester College. Eleven prime ministers to date have been educated at only non-fee-paying schools; these include all five who held office between 1964 and 1997 (Wilson, Heath, Callaghan, Thatcher, Major). Theresa May was educated at both independent and grammar schools. Three did not receive (primary or secondary) school education and were homeschooled during childhood.\nSixteen Prime ministers trained as barristers at the Inns of Court, including 12 at Lincoln's Inn (although not all were called to the bar). Two (Wellington and Churchill) completed officer training at military academies.\nAlthough William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath (in 1746) and James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave (in 1757) briefly attempted to form governments, neither is usually counted as prime minister.

She has also been married for over 20 years to Frank Underwood, a Democratic Congressman from South Carolina. She is a crucial part in helping Frank manipulate his way into the presidency after he is betrayed for the secretary of state nomination by new president Garrett Walker.\nIn season 2, she is the new Second Lady of the United States from December 2013 after Frank becomes Walker's vice president. By the end of this season, she becomes First Lady of the United States in October 2014 when Frank ensures Walker's resignation and his own ascension to the position of president.\nIn season 3, she serves for a few months in 2015 as United States Ambassador to the United Nations but is forced to resign after falling for a manipulation of Russian President Viktor Petrov. The reason publicly stated for her resignation is to focus on Frank's re-election bid to cover up her failing. This event, combined with increasing tensions with Frank motivates her to leave him just before the Democratic New Hampshire primary in January 2016.\nAfter weeks of tensions between the two and a coverup of their marital split, Claire returns to Frank when he is shot and wounded in an assassination attempt in March 2016. This is however at the cost of Frank agreeing to make her his vice presidential candidate for the presidential election by manipulating the Democratic National Convention. With Frank facing investigation at the end of Season 4 due to past crimes, Claire suggests stirring up fear of terrorism to improve their popularity.\nDuring the events of Season 5, Claire is elected as Vice President of the United States in the 2016 election by the Senate initially after the Underwood campaign abuses presidential power to force Ohio and Tennessee into a scenario where their results cannot be certified, thus throwing the election of president to the House of Representatives. She becomes Acting President of the United States on January 20, 2017 due to the House being unable to choose between Frank and Republican nominee Will Conway. During her acting term, Claire proposes a new election in Ohio and Tennessee that is adopted by Congress and sees the Underwood's win after leaking damaging recordings of Conway and his vice presidential candidate, General Ted Brockhart.\nClaire resumes her new role as vice president once Frank resumes office in mid February 2017 but Frank is continually hounded by congressional investigations into his past. Frank, with the help of Chief of Staff Doug Stamper, manipulates events to allow a face saving resignation.\nTherefore, Claire is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on March 15, 2017 after Frank submits his resignation. This concludes Season 5.\nPlayed by: Robin Wright\nPolitical Party: Democrat\n\n\n=== President Francis J. \"Frank\" Underwood ===\nPresident in House of Cards (Season 2\u20135)\nAt the start of the series, he is the Democratic Majority Whip in the United States House of Representatives and a Congressman from South Carolina. He is initially promised the position of US Secretary of State by incoming President Garrett Walker but when Walker reneges, Underwood sets in motion a plan to replace Walker as president.\nThe first half of his plan sees him become vice president after manipulating a situation to get incumbent vice president Jim Matthews to run in the special election for his old position as Governor of Pennsylvania, with Frank destroying the campaign of Congressman Peter Russo. Frank then makes a deal with Raymond Tusk, a billionaire energy tycoon with significant influence over President Walker, to ensure Frank replaces Matthews as vice president. During these efforts, Frank is forced to murder his lover Zoe Barnes, a journalist,\nAssassination attempts and plots on the President of the United States have been numerous, ranging from the early 19th century to the present day. This article lists assassinations and assassination attempts on incumbent and former presidents and presidents-elect, but not on those who had not yet been elected president.\nFour sitting presidents have been killed: Abraham Lincoln (1865, by John Wilkes Booth), James A. Garfield (1881, by Charles J. Guiteau), William McKinley (1901, by Leon Czolgosz), and John F. Kennedy (1963, by Lee Harvey Oswald). Ronald Reagan (1981, by John Hinckley Jr.) is the only sitting U.S. president to have been injured in an assassination attempt while in office and survive. Theodore Roosevelt (1912, by John Schrank) and Donald Trump (2024, by Thomas Matthew Crooks) are the only two former presidents to be injured in an assassination attempt although Donald Trump would be re-elected later in 2024.\nIn all of these cases, the attacker's weapon was a firearm, and all the subjects were male. Gerald Ford experienced two attempted assassinations with a woman as the assailant.\nMany assassination attempts, both successful and unsuccessful, were motivated by a desire to change the policy of the American government. Not all such attacks, however, had political reasons. Many other attackers had questionable mental stability, and a few were judged legally insane. Historian James W. Clarke suggests that most assassination attempters have been sane and politically motivated, whereas the Department of Justice's legal manual claims that a large majority has been insane. Some assassins, especially mentally ill ones, acted solely on their own, whereas those pursuing political agendas have more often found supporting conspirators. Most assassination plotters were arrested and punished by execution or lengthy detention in a prison or insane asylum.\nThe fact that the successor of a removed president is the vice president, and all vice presidents since Andrew Johnson have shared the president's political party affiliation, may discourage such attacks, at least for policy reasons, even in times of partisan strife. The third person in line, the Speaker of the House, as outlined in the Presidential Succession Act, is often of the opposing party, however.\nThreats of violence against the president are often made for rhetorical or humorous effect without serious intent, while credibly threatening the president of the United States has been a federal felony since 1917.\n\n\n== Presidents assassinated ==\n\n\n=== Abraham Lincoln ===\n\nAbraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, was the first U.S. president to be assassinated (though not the first to die in office). The assassination took place on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., at about 10:15 PM. The assassin, John Wilkes Booth, was a well-known actor and a Confederate sympathizer from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate Army, he had contacts within the Confederate Secret Service. In 1864, Booth formulated a plan (very similar to one of Thomas N. Conrad previously authorized by the Confederacy) to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11, 1865 speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for Black people, Booth decided to assassinate the president instead. Learning that the president would be attending Ford's Theatre, Booth planned with co-conspirators to assassinate Lincoln at the theater. The conspiracy also included assassinating Vice President Andrew Johnson in Kirkwood House, where Johnson lived while Vice President.  and Secretary of State William H. Seward at Seward's house. On April 14, 1865 Lincoln attended the play Our American Cousin at Ford's Theatre. As the president sat in his state box in the balcony watching the play with his wife Mary and two guests, Major Henry Rathbone and Rathbone's fianc\u00e9e Clara Harris, Booth entered from behind. He aimed a .44-calib\nThe second lady of the United States or second gentleman (SLOTUS or SGOTUS) is the informal title held by the spouse of the vice president of the United States, concurrent with the vice president's term of office. Coined in contrast to \"first lady\" \u2013 albeit used less commonly \u2013 the title \"second lady\" was apparently first used by Jennie Tuttle Hobart (wife of Garret Hobart, vice president 1897\u20131899) to refer to herself. The first second gentleman of the United States is Doug Emhoff, the husband of Kamala Harris, the current vice president and first woman in the position, since January 20, 2021.\nTwelve second ladies have gone on to become first ladies during their husbands' terms as president. The first to do this was Abigail Adams, who was married to John Adams, who was the first vice president from 1789 to 1797 and then the second president from 1797 to 1801. Thus, Abigail was the first second lady and the second first lady. The most recent to do this is Jill Biden, who is married to Joe Biden, the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 and then the 46th president since 2021.\nSince the 1970s, the vice presidential official residence is Number One Observatory Circle in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe second spouse's visibility in the public sphere has been a somewhat recent development. Although the role of the first lady as White House hostess dates from the beginning of the republic (and was typically filled by another member of the president's family if the president was unmarried or a widower), with a few exceptions, it was generally not until the late 20th century and early 21st century that vice-presidential wives took on public roles that attracted significant media attention.\nIn one notable exception, Floride Calhoun, wife of Vice President John C. Calhoun, was a central figure in the Petticoat Affair, a social-political scandal which involved the social ostracism of Secretary of War John H. Eaton and his wife Margaret O'Neill Eaton, further damaging already-strained relations between Vice President Calhoun and President Andrew Jackson.\n\nIn 1978, Muriel Humphrey, wife of Vice President Hubert Humphrey, became the only former second lady to hold public office; after her husband, who had returned to the U.S. Senate after his term as vice president, died in office, she was appointed by Minnesota governor Rudy Perpich to continue her husband's term.\nThere have been 17 periods of vacancy in the role, the longest of which continued for 16 years between the service of vice presidential spouses Abigail Adams and Ann Gerry when there were three widower vice presidents and a one-year vacancy in the vice presidency. The most recent second lady vacancy was for 132 days in 1974, between the service of Betty Ford and Happy Rockefeller, when the vice presidency was also vacant.\n\n\n=== Role in practice ===\nThe role of the second lady is unpaid and not formally defined. The wife of the vice president of the United States was traditionally expected to serve as a hostess and appear at society functions. Jennie Tuttle Hobart, wife of Vice President Garret Hobart (1897\u20131899) is often cited as the first woman to style herself as \"Second Lady\". Hobart took over the hostess duties on behalf of First Lady Ida Saxton McKinley, who had chronic health issues including epilepsy. Starting in 1917, the wife of the vice president took on the unofficial role of convener of the Red Cross Senate Wives, presiding over their lunches; the organization later became known as the Senate Spouses Club. The question of the second lady's status became a topic of debate in 1929 when Dolly Curtis Gann, the sister of Vice President Charles Curtis (1929\u20131933), assumed the role of hostess on his behalf, since he was widowed. Gann had waged a public \"battle of precedence\" against Alice Roosevelt Longworth, the wife of the late speaker of the House.\n\nOver time, the spouse of the vice president started to become more visible as the Office of the Vice President itself \nSince the office was established in 1789, 45 persons have served as president of the United States. Of these, eight have died in office: four were assassinated, and four died of natural causes. In each of these instances, the vice president has succeeded to the presidency. This practice is now governed by Section One of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1967, which declares that, \"the Vice President shall become President\" if the president is removed from office, dies, or resigns. The initial authorization for this practice was provided by Article II, Section 1, Clause 6, of the U.S. Constitution.\nThe first incumbent U.S. president to die was William Henry Harrison, on April 4, 1841, only one month after Inauguration Day. He died from complications of what at the time was believed to be pneumonia. The second American president to die in office, Zachary Taylor, died on July 9, 1850, from acute gastroenteritis. Abraham Lincoln was the first U.S. president to be killed while in office. He was shot by John Wilkes Booth on the night of April 14, 1865, and died the following morning. Sixteen years later, on July 2, 1881, James A. Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau, surviving for over two months before dying on September 19, 1881.\nOn September 14, 1901, William McKinley died, eight days after being shot by Leon Czolgosz. Next, Warren G. Harding suffered a heart attack, and died on August 2, 1923. On April 12, 1945, Franklin D. Roosevelt (who had just begun his fourth term in office) collapsed and died as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage. The most recent U.S. president to die in office was John F. Kennedy, who was shot by Lee Harvey Oswald on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas.\n\n\n== 1841: William Henry Harrison ==\n\nOn March 26, 1841, William Henry Harrison became ill with a cold after being caught in a torrential downpour without cover. His symptoms grew progressively worse over the ensuing two days, at which time a team of doctors was called in to treat him. After making a diagnosis of right lower lobe pneumonia, they proceeded to place heated suction cups on his bare torso and to administer a series of bloodlettings, to supposedly draw out the disease. When those procedures failed to bring about improvement, the doctors treated him with ipecac, Castor oil, calomel, and finally with a boiled mixture of crude petroleum and Virginia snakeroot. All this only weakened Harrison further.\nInitially, no official announcement was made concerning Harrison's illness, which, the longer he remained out of public view, fueled public speculation and concern. By the end of the month large crowds were gathering outside the White House, holding vigil while awaiting any news about the president's condition. On the evening of April 4, 1841, nine days after becoming ill, and exactly one month after taking the oath of office, Harrison died at age 68. His last words were to his attending doctor, though assumed to be directed at Vice President John Tyler:\n\nSir, I wish you to understand the true principles of the government. I wish them carried out. I ask nothing more.\nA 30-day period of mourning commenced following the president's death. Various public ceremonies, modeled after European royal funeral practices, were held. An invitation-only funeral service was also held, on April 7 in the East Room of the White House, after which Harrison's coffin was brought to Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C., where it was placed in a temporary receiving vault.\nThat June, Harrison's body was transported by train and river barge to North Bend, Ohio. Then, on July 7, 1841, the nation's 9th president was buried in a family tomb at the summit of Mt. Nebo, overlooking the Ohio River \u2013 the William Henry Harrison Tomb State Memorial.\nHarrison's death sparked a brief constitutional crisis regarding succession to the presidency, as the U.S. Constitution was unclear as to whether Vice President John Tyler should assume the of\nThis article includes information on the African heritage of presidents of the United States, together with information on unsubstantiated claims that certain presidents of the United States had African ancestry. (All Homo sapiens descend from ancestors on the African continent, but \"African heritage\" here means descent from sub-Saharan Africans in roughly the past 500 years.)\n\n\n== Presidents with African ancestry ==\n\n\n=== Barack Obama ===\nPresident Barack Obama, who served as the 44th president of the United States from 2009 to 2017, had an African father and an American mother of mostly European ancestry. His father, Barack Obama Sr. (1936\u20131982), was a Luo Kenyan from Nyang'oma Kogelo, Kenya. In July 2012, drawing on a combination of historical documents and Y-DNA analysis, Ancestry.com found a strong likelihood that Obama\u2014through his mother, Stanley Ann Dunham\u2014was descended from John Punch, known as the \"first official slave in the English colonies.\"\n\n\n== Unsubstantiated claims that presidents had African ancestry ==\nClaims that certain U.S. presidents other than Barack Obama had African or African-American ancestry have been made by the amateur historian J. A. Rogers, ophthalmologist Leroy William Vaughn, and psychologist Auset BaKhufu. All base their theories chiefly on the work of J. A. Rogers, who apparently self-published a pamphlet in 1965 claiming that five presidents of the United States, widely accepted as white, also had African ancestry. Historian Henry Louis Gates has written that Rogers' pamphlet \"would get the 'Black History Wishful Thinking Prize,' hands down\". Vaughn's and BaKhufu's books were also self-published.\nHistorians' and biographers' studies of these presidents have not supported such claims, and they lack empirical evidence. These authors are generally ignored by scholars. They have been classified as \"rumormongers and amateur historians\" as well as conspiracy theorists. Vaughn and BaKhufu have added little substantive research to their claims, but there have been more rumors of the potential African heritage of other presidents in the decades since Rogers published his pamphlet. These rumors are considered unsubstantiated and have not been acknowledged by historians.\n\n\n=== Thomas Jefferson ===\nVaughn and others claim Thomas Jefferson's mother Jane Randolph Jefferson was of mixed-race ancestry. The academic consensus does not support such claims. In her recent analyses of historical evidence about the Hemings and Jeffersons, for example, the scholar Annette Gordon-Reed makes no claim of African descent in the Randolph family.\nSpecifically, Vaughn says, \"The chief attack on Jefferson was in a book written by Thomas Hazard in 1867 called The Johnny Cake Papers.  Hazard interviewed Paris Gardiner, who said he was present during the 1796 presidential campaign, when one speaker states that Thomas Jefferson was a mean-spirited son of a half-breed Indian squaw and a Virginia mulatto father.\" An overlapping claim is that, in an 18th-century presidential campaign, someone speaking against Jefferson's candidacy and in favor of that of John Adams accused Jefferson of being \"half Injun, half nigger, half Frenchman\" and born to a \"mulatto father\" or slave and \"a half-breed Indian squaw\", this birth to a mulatto and an Indian allegedly \"well-known in the neighbourhood where he was raised\" but otherwise unproven. These claims are based on damning stories from Jefferson's political opponents and are best understood as race-baiting rather than evidence about his actual lineage. \nThe Thomas Jefferson Foundation, which owns and operates Monticello, the major public history site on Jefferson, characterizes Jefferson's parents this way: \"His father Peter Jefferson was a successful planter and surveyor and his mother Jane Randolph a member of one of Virginia's most distinguished families.\" They describe the quote in The Johnny Cake Papers as one frequently repeated, but it is attributed in written sources to the 1800 ra\nIn the United States, education is provided in public and private schools and by individuals through homeschooling. State governments set overall educational standards, often mandate standardized tests for K\u201312 public school systems and supervise, usually through a board of regents, state colleges, and universities. The bulk of the $1.3 trillion in funding comes from state and local governments, with federal funding accounting for about $260 billion in 2021 compared to around $200 billion in past years.\nPrivate schools are free to determine their own curriculum and staffing policies, with voluntary accreditation available through independent regional accreditation authorities, although some state regulation can apply.\nAs of 2013, about 87% of school-age children attended state-funded public schools, about 10% attended tuition and foundation-funded private schools, and roughly 3% were home-schooled.\nTotal expenditures for American public elementary and secondary schools amounted to $927 billion in 2020\u201321 (in constant 2021\u201322 dollars).\nBy state law, education is compulsory over an age range starting between five and eight and ending somewhere between ages sixteen and nineteen, depending on the state. This requirement can be satisfied in public or state-certified private schools, or an approved home school program. Compulsory education is divided into three levels: elementary school, middle or junior high school, and high school.\nNumerous publicly and privately administered colleges and universities offer a wide variety of post-secondary education. Post-secondary education is divided into college, as the first tertiary degree, and graduate school. Higher education includes public research universities, private liberal arts colleges, historically black colleges and universities, community colleges, for-profit colleges, and many other kinds and combinations of institutions. College enrollment rates in the United States have increased over the long term. At the same time, student loan debt has also risen to $1.5 trillion.\nThe large majority of the world's top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the United States, including 19 of the top 25, and the most prestigious \u2013 Harvard University. The country placed first in the annual U.S. News & World Report Best Countries for Education rankings. The U.S. has by far the most Nobel Prize winners in history, with 403 (having won 406 awards).\nIn 2010, the United States had a higher combined per-pupil spending for primary, secondary, and post-secondary education than any other OECD country (which overlaps with almost all of the countries designated as being developed by the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations) and the U.S. education sector consumed a greater percentage of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) than the average OECD country. In 2014, the country spent 6.2% of its GDP on all levels of education\u20141.0 percentage points above the OECD average of 5.2%. In 2018, primary and secondary per-pupil spending in the United States was 34 percent higher than the OECD average (ranking 5th of 36 countries reporting data), post-secondary per-pupil spending was double the OECD average (ranking 2nd), and the U.S. education sector consumed 6 percent of the U.S. GDP (ranking 6th).\nFrom 1960 through 2017, per-pupil spending in public kindergartens, primary schools, and secondary schools increased in inflation-adjusted terms from $3,793 to $14,439. From 1950 through 2015, student-teacher and student-nonteaching staff ratios in public kindergartens, primary schools, and secondary schools declined from 27.5 students per teacher and 65 students per nonteaching staff member in 1950 to 16.1 students per teacher and 16.1 students per nonteaching staff member in 2015 (with nonteaching staffing increasing by 709%), while teacher salaries declined by 2% in inflation-adjusted terms from 1992 to 2015. From 1976 to 2018, enrollment at post-secondary institutions increased \nThe United States secretary of education is the head of the United States Department of Education. The secretary serves as the principal advisor to the president of the United States, and the federal government, on policies, programs, and activities related to all education in the United States. As a member of the Cabinet of the United States, the secretary is sixteenth in the line of succession to the presidency.\nThe current secretary of education is Miguel Cardona, who was confirmed by the Senate on March 1, 2021.\n\n\n== Function ==\nThe United States secretary of education is a member of the president's Cabinet and is the fifteenth in the United States presidential line of succession. This secretary deals with federal influence over education policy, and heads the United States Department of Education.\nThe secretary is advised by the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity, an advisory committee, on \"matters related to accreditation and to the eligibility and certification process for institutions of higher education.\"\n\n\n== List of secretaries ==\nPrior to the creation of the Department of Education in 1979, Education was a division of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.\n\nParties\n  Democrat\n  Republican\n\nStatus\n\n\n=== Health, Education, and Welfare ===\n\n\n=== United States Secretary of Education ===\nSource\n\n\n== See also ==\nEducation in the United states\nSpecial education in the U.S\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nUnder Article I, Section 3, Clause 4 of the Constitution of the United States, the vice president of the United States is the ex officio president of the Senate but may only cast a vote in the Senate to break a tie. As of December 5, 2023, vice presidents have cast a total of 301 tie-breaking votes in the Senate. There are also two tie-breaking votes cast by Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase during the 1868 impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, although it is still debated whether he had the authority to do so.\n\n\n== Constitutional basis ==\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause 4 of the Constitution of the United States states:\n\nThe Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nJohn Adams, the first vice president of the United States, cast 29 tie-breaking votes during his tenure. His first vote was on July 18, 1789. He used his votes to preserve the president's sole authority over the removal of appointees, influence the location of the national capital, and prevent war with Great Britain. At times, he even convinced senators to vote against legislation that he opposed and often provided guidance on procedural and policy matters. Adams' political views and active role in the Senate made him a target for critics of the Washington administration. Toward the end of his first term, threatened by a resolution that would have silenced him on all but procedural and policy matters, he exercised more restraint, hoping to be elected president of the United States in his own right.\nJohn C. Calhoun was the only vice president to cast tie-breaking votes against his own president, Andrew Jackson. In 1832, Calhoun cast a tie-breaking vote to delay and later defeat the nomination of Martin Van Buren as United States Minister to the United Kingdom. Calhoun's supporters in the Senate allowed him to defy Jackson, where just enough of Calhoun's faction abstained to create a tie that he then broke.\nIn the early 21st century, the threat of a filibuster increased the use of cloture to end debate in the Senate, especially on highly divisive issues, making it rare for the vice president to have the opportunity to cast a decisive vote, as cloture requires a three-fifths majority. However, rules changes in 2013 and 2017 reduced the requirement for cloture on nominations to a simple majority, which led to the first use of a tie-breaking vote to confirm a Cabinet member when Vice President Mike Pence confirmed Betsy DeVos as secretary of education in 2017. In 2018, Pence cast a tie-breaking vote to confirm Jonathan A. Kobes to the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, the first such vote to confirm a judicial nominee in U.S. history. \nFollowing the 2020 Senate elections, the Senate was divided 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats in the 117th Congress. Votes by Vice President Kamala Harris played a critical role in passing Democratic legislation, including the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act. In addition, Harris gave the Democratic Party majority-control of the Senate. On July 20, 2021, Harris broke Pence's record for the most tie-breaking votes in the first year of a vice presidency, casting seven tie-breaking votes in her first six months. She cast a total of 15 tie-breaking votes in her first year, setting a new record for the most tie-breaking votes in a single year in U.S. history, surpassing the 12 votes cast by John Adams in 1790. On May 11, 2022, Harris set a new record for tie-breaking votes in a single day, casting four votes. On July 13, 2023, Harris matched Calhoun's record for the most tie-breaking votes cast by a vice president in U.S history at 31 votes. On December 5, 2023, Harris broke Calhoun's record. In response, she received a \"golden gavel\" from Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to recognize her record.\nThe recent dramatic rise in the frequency of vice presidential votes is due in part to the Senate often being equally \nThe following is a list of fictional presidents of the United States, A through B.\n\n\n== A ==\n\n\n=== President Truman Abbott ===\nPresident in: The Vegas Legacy by Ovid Demaris (1983).\nRuns for a second term when arriving in Las Vegas for his party's convention.\nIs challenged for re-nomination by former governor Hamilton Foote.\nCuts a deal with mobsters to take on corrupt Nevada senator Randolph Godwin as a running mate.\n\n\n=== President William Abbott ===\nPresident in: Advise and Consent\nSpeaker of the House and a Representative from Colorado.\nSucceeds to presidency upon assassination of President Harley Hudson.\nDeclines to run for reelection, which leads to the election contest between Orrin Knox (The Promise of Joy) and Edward M.

The vice president is also an officer in the legislative branch, as the president of the Senate. In this capacity, the vice president is empowered to preside over the United States Senate, but may not vote except to cast a tie-breaking vote. The vice president is indirectly elected at the same time as the president to a four-year term of office by the people of the United States through the Electoral College, but the electoral votes are cast separately for these two offices. Following the passage in 1967 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the US Constitution, a vacancy in the office of vice president may be filled by presidential nomination and confirmation by a majority vote in both houses of Congress.\nThe modern vice presidency is a position of significant power and is widely seen as an integral part of a president's administration. The presidential candidate selects the candidate for the vice presidency, as their running mate in the lead-up to the presidential election. While the exact nature of the role varies in each administration, since the vice president's service in office is by election, the president cannot dismiss the vice president, and the personal working-relationship with the president varies, most modern vice presidents serve as a key presidential advisor, governing partner, and representative of the president. The vice president is also a statutory member of the United States Cabinet and United States National Security Council and thus plays a significant role in executive government and national security matters. As the vice president's role within the executive branch has expanded, the legislative branch role has contracted; for example, vice presidents now preside over the Senate only infrequently.\nThe role of the vice presidency has changed dramatically since the office was created during the 1787 Constitutional Convention. Originally something of an afterthought, the vice presidency was considered an insignificant office for much of the nation's history, especially after the Twelfth Amendment meant that vice presidents were no longer the runners-up in the presidential election. The vice president's role began steadily growing in importance during the 1930s, with the Office of the Vice President being created in the executive branch in 1939, and has since grown much further. Due to its increase in power and prestige, the vice presidency is now often considered to be a stepping stone to the presidency. Since the 1970s, the vice president has been afforded an official residence at Number One Observatory Circle.\nThe Constitution does not expressly assign the vice presidency to a branch of the government, causing a dispute among scholars about which branch the office belongs to (the executive, the legislative, both, or neither). The modern view of the vice president as an officer of the executive branch\u2014one isolated almost entirely from the legislative branch\u2014is due in large part to the assignment of executive authority to the vice president by either the president or Congress. Nevertheless, many vice presidents have previously served in Congress, and are often tasked with helping to advance an administration's legislative priorities.\nKamala Harris is the 49th and current vice president of the United States. A former senator, she is the first African American, first Asian American and first female occupant of the office. Harris is the highest ranking female official in United States history.

Santos wins the party nomination on the fourth ballot and names former Labor Secretary and White House Chief of Staff Leo McGarry as his running mate.\nSantos narrowly defeats Senator Arnold Vinick of California by a count of 272 to 266 electoral votes. However, this victory is undermined by the sudden death of Leo McGarry (written due to the real-life passing of McGarry's portrayer, actor John Spencer) on Election Night.\nBefore his inauguration, Santos names his defeated rival Vinick his Secretary of State, ensuring bipartisan cooperation in handling growing tensions between Russia and China, and seeks the confirmation of Pennsylvania Governor Eric Baker as his Vice President.\nSecond sitting U.S. Congressman to be elected to the Presidency after James A.

Separate statistics are maintained for the five permanently inhabited territories of the United States: Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands.\nAs of April 1, 2010, the date of the 2010 United States Census, the nine most populous U.S. states contain slightly more than half of the total population. The 25 least populous states contain less than one-sixth of the total population. California, the most populous state, contains more people than the 21 least populous states combined, and Wyoming, the least populous state, has a population less than any of the 31 most populous U.S. cities.\n\n\n== Method ==\nThe United States Census counts the persons residing in the United States including citizens, non-citizen permanent residents and non-citizen long-term visitors. Civilian and military federal employees serving abroad and their dependents are counted in their home state.\n\n\n== Electoral apportionment ==\nEvery 10 years, the U.S. Census Bureau is charged with making an actual count of all residents by state and territory.  The accuracy of this count is then tested after the fact, and sometimes statistically significant undercounts or overcounts occur.  For example, for the 2020 decennial census, 14 states had significant miscounts ranging from 1.5% to 6.6%.  While these adjustments may be reflected in government programs over the following decade, the 10-year representative apportionments discussed below are not changed to reflect the miscount.\n\n\n=== House of Representatives ===\nBased on this decennial census, each state is allocated a portion of the 435 fixed seats in the United States House of Representatives (until the early 20th century, the apportionment process generally increased the size of the House based on the results of the census until the size of the House was capped by the Reapportionment Act of 1929), with each state guaranteed at least one Representative. The allocation is based on each state's proportion of the combined population of the fifty states (not including the District of Columbia, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, or the United States Virgin Islands).\n\n\n=== Electoral College ===\nThe Electoral College, every four years, elects the President and Vice President of the United States based on the popular vote in each state and the District of Columbia. Each state's number of votes in the Electoral College is equal to its number of members in the Senate plus members in the House of Representatives.\nThe Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution additionally grants the District of Columbia (D.C.), which is not part of any state, as many Electoral College votes as it would have if it were a state, while having no more votes than the least populous state (currently, Wyoming). Since the U.S. Constitution guarantees every state at least one member of the U.S. House of Representatives and two members of the U.S. Senate, every state has at least three Electoral College votes. Thus, the Electoral College has 538 members (100 senators, plus 435 representatives due to the limit imposed by the Reapportionment Act of 1929, plus 3 members for the District of Columbia). Territories of the United States such as Puerto Rico are not included in the Electoral College: people in those territories cannot vote directly for the President of the United States, although they may participate in the partisan nominating primaries and caucuses.\n\n\n== State and territory rankings ==\n\n* \u2014 non-voting member of the House of Representatives.\n\n\n== Summary of population by region ==\n\nColumn header abbreviations: # = Rank, Geo. = Geographic\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nGeneral\n\"National Totals: Vintage 2015\". United States Cens\nThe Cabinet of the United States is the principal official advisory body to the president of the United States. The Cabinet generally meets with the president in a room adjacent to the Oval Office in the West Wing of the White House. The president chairs the meetings but is not formally a member of the Cabinet. The vice president of the United States serves in the Cabinet by statute. The heads of departments, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, are members of the Cabinet, and acting department heads also participate in Cabinet meetings whether or not they have been officially nominated for Senate confirmation. The president may designate heads of other agencies and non-Senate-confirmed members of the Executive Office of the President as members of the Cabinet.\nThe Cabinet does not have any collective executive powers or functions of its own, and no votes need to be taken. There are 26 members: the vice president, 15 department heads, and 10 Cabinet-level officials, all except two of whom require Senate confirmation. During Cabinet meetings, the members sit in the order in which their respective department was created, with the earliest being closest to the president and the newest farthest away.\nThe members of the Cabinet whom the president appoints serve at the pleasure of the president. The president can dismiss them from office at any time without the approval of the Senate or downgrade their Cabinet membership status (the vice president of the United States is elected not appointed and serves in the Cabinet by statute). Functionally, the president may give wide latitude to department heads and often it is legally possible for a Cabinet member to exercise certain powers over his or her own department against the president's wishes, but in practice this is highly unusual due to the threat of dismissal. The president also has the authority to organize the Cabinet, such as instituting committees. Like all federal public officials, Cabinet members are also subject to impeachment by the House of Representatives and trial in the Senate for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\".\nThe Constitution of the United States does not explicitly establish a Cabinet. The Cabinet's role is inferred from the language of the Opinion Clause (Article II, Section 2, Clause 1) of the Constitution for principal officers of departments to provide advice to the president. Additionally, the Twenty-fifth Amendment authorizes the vice president, together with a majority of the heads of the executive departments, to declare the president \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\". The heads of the executive departments are\u2014if eligible\u2014in the presidential line of succession.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe tradition of the Cabinet arose out of the debates at the 1787 Constitutional Convention regarding whether the president would exercise executive authority solely or collaboratively with a cabinet of ministers or a privy council. As a result of the debates, the Constitution (Article II, Section 1, Clause 1) vests \"the executive power\" in the president singly, and authorizes\u2014but does not compel\u2014the president (Article II, Section 2, Clause 1) to \"require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices\". The Constitution does not specify what the executive departments will be, how many there will be, or what their duties will be.\nGeorge Washington, the first president of the United States, organized his principal officers into a Cabinet, and it has been part of the executive branch structure ever since. Washington's Cabinet consisted of five members: himself, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, Secretary of War Henry Knox and Attorney General Edmund Randolph.
