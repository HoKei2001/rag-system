        "content": "The Big 12 Conference is a college athletic conference headquartered in Irving, Texas. It consists of 16 full-member universities (3 private universities and 13 public universities) in the states of Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia.\nThe Big 12 is a member of the Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for all sports. Its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS; formerly Division I-A), the higher of two levels of NCAA Division I football competition.\nThe Big 12 is one of the Power Four conferences, the four highest-earning and most historically successful FBS football conferences. Power Four conferences are guaranteed at least one bid to a New Year's Six bowl game and have been granted exemptions from certain NCAA rules.\nThe Big 12 is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Brett Yormark became the commissioner on August 1, 2022.\nThe Big 12 was founded in February 1994. All eight members of the former Big Eight Conference joined with half the members of the former Southwest Conference (Texas, Texas A&M, Baylor and Texas Tech) to form the conference, with play beginning in 1996.\nArizona, Arizona State, Colorado, and Utah joined the conference on August 2, 2024, as part of a more extensive NCAA conference realignment.\n\n\n== Member universities ==\n\n\n=== Current full members ===\n\nNotes\n\n\n=== Membership map ===\n\n\n=== Affiliate members ===\n\nNotes\n\nOn July 29, 2015, the Big 12 announced it would add the six former members of the Western Wrestling Conference—Air Force, Northern Colorado, North Dakota State, South Dakota State, Utah Valley, and Wyoming—as affiliate members for wrestling, plus Denver as an affiliate member for women's gymnastics, all effective with the 2015–16 academic year.\nOn July 5, 2017, the Big 12 added Fresno State and Northern Iowa as wrestling affiliates.\nOn May 2, 2019, the Big 12 added Fresno State as an equestrian affiliate. Fresno State would drop wrestling in 2021, but remains an equestrian affiliate.\nIn 2021, the Big 12 added former full member Missouri as a wrestling affiliate.\n\n\n=== Former full members ===\n\nNotes\n\n\n=== Former affiliate members ===\n\nNotes\n\n\n=== Membership timeline ===\n\nFull members Other Conference Other Conference Affiliate member (other sport)Founding members from Big 8 Conference Founding members from Southwest Conference \n\n\n==== Earlier Membership timelines ====\nClick here for the Big Eight Conference Timeline which predates the Big 12 timeline for founding members:\n\nColorado\nIowa State\nKansas\nKansas State\nMissouri\nNebraska\nOklahoma\nOklahoma State\nClick here for the Southwest Conference Timeline which predates the Big 12 timeline for founding members:\n\nBaylor\nTexas\nTexas A&M\nTexas Tech\nCurrent members with the longest continuous association with the Big Eight Conference / Southwest Conference / Big 12 Conference.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe Big 12 Conference sponsors championship competition in 10 men's and 15 women's NCAA sanctioned sports.\n\n\n=== Current champions ===\nSource:\n\n\n=== Men's sponsored sports by university ===\nBelow are the men's sports sponsored by each member institution.\nThe only men's sports with full participation by the entire conference are basketball, football, and golf.

Before the conference's 2023 expansion, it had the most competing schools of any Big 12 sport, with 13 members at that time. The 2022–23 and 2024–25 wrestling lineups both included only 4 full conference members; all remaining wrestling schools were affiliate members (listed in a separate table below).\n\nMen's (and Coed – see Rifle) varsity sports not sponsored by the Big 12 Conference which are played by Big 12 universities:\n\n\n=== Women's sponsored sports by university ===\nBelow are the women's sports sponsored by each member institution.\nThe only women's sports with full part\nThe Big 12 Conference is a conference of 16 universities which participate in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I Football Bowl Subdivision football. The conference formed in 1994 and begin conference play in the fall of 1996. The schools that compose the Big 12 Conference, except for Arizona, Arizona State, Brigham Young, Central Florida, Cincinnati, Utah, and West Virginia, were members of either the Big Eight Conference or the Southwest Conference, and have won 21 national titles including 3 titles since the inception of the Big 12 Conference.\n\n\n== Membership ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\n\n†Divisions existed from 1996 through 2010.\n‡: The Big 12 Conference recognizes TCU and Baylor as co-champions in 2014\n\n\n=== Former ===\n\n\n=== Facilities and coaches ===\n\n† denotes school is a private institution and does not have disclose coaches pay\n\n\n== Realignment ==\nIn 2010 it was announced that in 2011 both Nebraska and Colorado would leave the Big 12 for the Big Ten and Pac-10 respectively. Then in 2011 it was announced that Texas A&M and Missouri would both be leaving for the SEC. As replacements, TCU and West Virginia would be joining the conference from the Mountain West and Big East respectively. In 2021, Oklahoma and Texas announced they would leave to join the Southeastern Conference. In response, the Big 12 decided to backfill with the University of Cincinnati, the University of Central Florida, the University of Houston, and Brigham Young University. The first 3 schools joining from the American Athletic Conference and BYU being an Independent in football since 2010, with its basketball team playing in the West Coast Conference.\nOn July 27, 2023, Colorado, a former member of the Big 12, announced it would rejoin the conference from the Pac-12 beginning in the 2024–25 academic year. The following week, Arizona, Arizona State, and Utah announced they would leave the Pac-12 for the Big 12, also effective for the 2024–25 academic year.\n\n\n== Scheduling ==\n\n\n=== Divisions ===\n\nFrom the time the league was formed until realignment, the conference was split into two, six team, divisions.  Teams played a total of 11 regular season games, three non-conference match-ups and eight conference games per season. The conference games were a combination of five divisional foes and three from the opposing division. Inter-divisional play is a \"three-on, three-off\" system, where teams will play three teams from the other division on a home-and-home basis for two seasons, and then play the other three foes from the opposite side for a two-year home-and-home.\nAt the conclusion of the regular season, the top team from the South Division played the top team from the North Division in the Big 12 Championship Game.\n\n\n=== Round-robin ===\nAfter the departure of Nebraska and Colorado, both the divisional format and the Championship Game were dropped. Members continue to play three non-conference opponents in addition to playing all nine other members of the conference on an annual basis.\nStarting again in 2017 the Championship Game was reinstated, the two teams with the highest conference winning percentage play in the game.\n\n\n== Champions ==\n\nSince its inception in 1996, the Big 12 championship has been won by nine different schools, three of which no longer belong to the conference. From 1996 to 2010, the championship was determined in the Big 12 championship game. Following the departures of two schools in 2010, the conference discontinued the championship game in favor of a round-robin format to determine the champion. The University of Oklahoma Sooners have won the most championships with 14.\n\n\n=== Championship game ===\n\nThe Big 12 Championship Game was first held by the Big 12 Conference each year from 1996 until 2010 and again starting with the 2017 season. The original championship game pitted the Big 12 North Division champion against the Big 12 South Division champion in a game held after the regular season has been completed. The \nThe Pac-12 Conference is a collegiate athletic conference in the Western United States. It participates at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I level for all sports, and its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), the highest level of NCAA football competition. The conference currently comprises two members, Oregon State and Washington State.\nThe modern Pac-12 Conference formed after the disbanding of the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC), the principal members of which founded the Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU) in 1959. The conference previously went by the names Big Five, Big Six, Pacific-8, and Pacific-10. The Pac-12 moniker was adopted in 2011 with the addition of Colorado and Utah.\nNicknamed the \"Conference of Champions\", the Pac-12 has won more NCAA national championships in team sports than any other conference in history. Washington's national title in women's rowing in 2017 was the 500th NCAA championship won by a Pac-12 school. The Pac-12 holds a 200-plus championship lead over the second-place conference.\nOn August 2, 2024, 10 of the 12 members departed from the conference. The Pac-12 is operating as a two-team conference through the 2025–26 academic year, sponsoring five sports—baseball, football, track and field, women's gymnastics, and wrestling. In 2026, the Pac-12 will expand to eight members with the addition of five schools from the Mountain West Conference and one from the West Coast Conference.\n\n\n== Member universities ==\n\n\n=== Full members ===\nThe Pac-12 currently has two full-member institutions. The conference was previously split into two divisions, the North Division and the South Division, for football only.\n\n\n=== Membership map ===\n\n\n=== Future members ===\nOn September 12, 2024, the conference announced it would be adding four new members, Boise State, Colorado State, Fresno State and San Diego State, on July 1, 2026. The conference needs to add at least two more members before that date to be recognized by the NCAA as an FBS conference. On September 23, 2024, Utah State accepted an offer to join the league as its seventh member. This gave the Pac-12 the seven members needed to preserve its official \"multisport\" status, though one more football-sponsoring full member will be needed to preserve FBS status. On September 30, 2024, the conference announced that Gonzaga would be joining as a full member. \n\n\n=== Affiliate members ===\nThe Pac-12 has two affiliate member institutions in California and one in Arkansas.\n\nNotes\n\n\n=== Former full members ===\nNo school had left the Pac-12 from its founding as the AAWU in 1959 until 2024, when 10 of its 12 schools left. Two members of the PCC, Idaho and Montana, were not invited to join the AAWU or its successors.\n\n\n=== Former affiliate members ===\n\nNotes\n\n\n=== Membership timeline ===\nThe Pac-12 claims the PCC's history as its own. Not only did it maintain the automatic bid from the Rose Bowl inherited from the PCC, but the eight largest schools in the old PCC all eventually joined the new league. However, the old PCC operated under a separate charter.\nThe Pac-12 is one of the founding members of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF), a conference organized to provide competition in non-revenue Olympic sports. All-Pac-12 members participate in at least one MPSF sport (men's and women's indoor track and field both actually have enough participating Pac-12 schools for the conference to sponsor a championship, but the Pac-12 has opted not to do so). For certain sports, the Pac-12 admits certain schools as associate members.\n\n Full members  Full members (non-football) Other Conference  Other Conference  Associate members (non-football)\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pacific Coast Conference ===\n\nThe roots of the Pac-12 Conference go back to December 2, 1915, when the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) was founded at a meeting at the Imperial Hotel in Portland, Oregon. Charter members were the University of \nThe Big 12 Conference is a 16-school collegiate athletic conference headquartered in Irving, Texas. The Big 12 is a member of the Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for all sports. Its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS; formerly Division I-A), the higher of two levels of NCAA Division I football competition. Member schools are located in Arizona, Colorado. Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah,  and West Virginia.\nThe Big 12 Conference is the second youngest of the major college athletic conferences in the United States. It was formed in 1994 when all 8 members of one of the oldest conferences, the Big Eight, were joined by 4 of the Texas members of one of the other oldest conferences, the Southwest Conference. From its formation until 2011, its 12 members competed in two divisions. Major membership changes came during the 2010–2013 Big 12 Conference realignment and still more changes came or will come during the 2021–2024 NCAA conference realignment.\nIn 2012, the Big 12 Conference formed an alliance with the Southeastern Conference for a 12-year deal starting in the 2014 season to host a joint post-season college bowl game between the champions of each conference in the Sugar Bowl (except for the 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2023 seasons when the bowl game is used as a College Football Playoff semifinal game).\n\n\n== Origins ==\n\n\n=== College Football Association last days ===\nOn June 27, 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma that the NCAA could not punish its membership for selling their media content. As a result, individual schools and athletic conferences were freed to negotiate contracts on their own behalf.\nThe Big Ten and Pacific-10 conferences sold their rights to ABC.  Most of the rest of the Division I-A football programs (what is now called the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, or FBS) chose to sell their rights together through an organization called the College Football Association to ABC and CBS.  The primary function of the CFA was to negotiate television broadcast rights for its member conferences and independent colleges.\nBy 1990, the television landscape had changed and a number of the stronger programs saw opportunities for better deals outside of the CFA. Notre Dame left the CFA and sold their home game broadcast rights to NBC.\nWhen the Southeastern Conference (SEC) invited the University of Arkansas and the University of South Carolina to join in 1990, it created shockwaves across the CFA. The other CFA conferences correctly assumed the SEC made these additions to create a better TV product with the idea of leaving the CFA.\nThe SEC represented one of the more valuable CFA assets.  It seemed likely that if the SEC departed, the other conferences could have difficulty securing good TV deals.\nAfter Arkansas' departure from the Southwest Conference, the SWC and Big Eight Conference recognized they were in a poor position. The SEC, with about 18% of the nation's TV audience, had a very strong TV position. The Big 8 had an 8.1% share.  The Texas-based SWC had an even weaker hand with only 6.7%.\nIn February 1994, the SEC announced that it would leave the CFA and negotiate independently for a television deal that covered SEC schools only.  This led The Dallas Morning News to proclaim that \"the College Football Association as a television entity is dead\".  In 1995, the SEC and the Big East broke from the CFA, signing a national deal with CBS.  The SEC would earn a staggering $95 million from the deal.  More significantly, this change in television contracts ultimately would lead to a significant realignment of college conferences.\n\n\n=== The Southwest Conference ===\nFor decades the Southwest Conference (SWC) was one of the most dominant football conferences in America. It was seen as a football peer to other elite conferences like the Pacific Coast Conference (precursor to today's Pac-12), Big Ten\nThe 2024 Big 12 Conference football season will be the 29th season of the Big 12 Conference football taking place during the 2024 NCAA Division I FBS football season.\nThe 2024 season is the first season for the Big 12 to have 16 members, with the departure of Oklahoma and Texas, the return of Colorado after a 13-season absence, and the addition of Arizona, Arizona State, and Utah.\nThe 2024 Big 12 Championship Game will be played at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas on December 7, 2024, between the two highest finishing teams in the conference.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Previous season ===\nThe Texas Longhorns defeated the Oklahoma State Cowboys 49–21 in the Big 12 championship.\nNine teams participated in bowl games, finishing with a record of 5–4.

The game was played each year since the conference's formation in 1996 until 2010 and returned during the 2017 season. From 1996 to 2010, the championship game pitted the Big 12 North Division champion against the South Division champion in a game held after the regular season was completed. From 2017 onward, the game features the two teams with the best conference records.\nIn the first eight Big 12 championship games, from 1996 to 2003, the divisions split four games each, with the north champion winning in every odd-numbered year and the south champion winning in every even-numbered year. However, the North division champion did not win after No. 13 Kansas State's 35–7 upset victory over No. 1 Oklahoma in 2003.\nThe Big 12 is under contract to play the game at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas until 2030.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first championship game was played after the 1996 regular season, the first year of play for the Big 12 (which was created from the merger of the Big Eight Conference and four teams from the Southwest Conference). Like the SEC Championship Game (which has been played since 1992), the game matched the winners of the conference's two six-team divisions. The championship game was held at several sites within the Big 12 states, with Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, hosting more often than any other venue.\nThe 2008 Big 12 Championship Game was notable for the controversy over choosing the South Division representative. The Oklahoma Sooners, Texas Longhorns, and Texas Tech Red Raiders all finished with identical records and had each recorded a win and loss among one another. The Sooners earned a berth to the title game because they had the highest Bowl Championship Series ranking of the three at the time of selection. Oklahoma defeated the Missouri Tigers and earned a berth in the 2009 BCS National Championship Game.\nFrom 2009 through 2013, the game was scheduled to be played at Cowboys Stadium, now known as AT&T Stadium, in Arlington, Texas. During June 2010, however, Nebraska and Colorado announced that they would leave the Big 12 for other conferences (the Big Ten Conference and the Pac-12 Conference, respectively) in 2011. Because NCAA rules at the time required that a conference have 12 members in order to stage a football championship game that was exempt from NCAA limits on regular-season games, the conference dropped the championship game following the 2010 season. During this time, Oklahoma and Texas had expressed that a conference title game hurt the chances of the conference to have a representative in the BCS National Championship Game, and now the College Football Playoff, which started in 2014.\nIn December 2014 after completing the first season with the College Football Playoff, Baylor and TCU both finished the season with an 8–1 conference record and were declared co-champions by the conference despite Baylor's head-to-head win over TCU. When the selection committee met to set the teams for the first playoff, both Baylor and TCU were overlooked in favor of teams that competed in and won their conference's championship game, leaving the Big 12 out of the playoffs. This led to criticism of how the Big 12 determined its champion.\nIn April 2015, legislation was developed by the ACC and the Big 12 to deregulate conference championship games. It was announced by NCAA officials as being expected to pass in time for the start of the 2016 season.  The legislation passed on January 14, 2016 allowing a conference with fewer than twelve teams to stage a championship game between the top two teams, so long as they play a round-robin schedule. In late 2016, the Big 12 decided to bring back the championship game in 2017 after a seven-year-long gap of having no conference championship game.\n\n\n== Results ==\nBelow are the results from all Big 12 Championship Games played\nThe American Athletic Conference (AAC), also known as The American, is a collegiate athletic conference in the United States, featuring 13 full member universities and six affiliate member universities that compete in The National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Division I. Its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). Member universities represent a range of private and public research universities of various enrollment sizes located primarily in urban metropolitan areas in the Northeastern, Midwestern, and Southern regions of the United States.\nThe American's legal predecessor, the original Big East Conference, was considered one of the six collegiate power conferences of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) era in college football, and The American inherited that status in the BCS's final season. With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, The American became a \"Group of Five\" conference, which shares one automatic spot in the New Year's Six bowl games.\nThe league is the product of substantial turmoil in The Old Big East during The 2010–14 conference realignment period. It is one of two conferences to emerge from the all-sports Big East in 2013. While the other successor, which does not sponsor football, purchased The Big East Conference name, The American inherited The Old Big East's structure and is that conference's legal successor. However, both conferences claim 1979 as their founding date, and the same history up to 2013. The American Athletic Conference is headquartered in Irving, Texas, and led by Commissioner Tim Pernetti, who replaced the retiring Mike Aresco on June 1, 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The Big East ===\n\nThe Big East Conference was founded in 1979 as a basketball conference and included the colleges of Providence, St. John's, Georgetown, and Syracuse, which in turn invited Connecticut (UConn), Holy Cross, Rutgers, and Boston College to be members. UConn and Boston College would accept the invitation, while Holy Cross soon thereafter declined the invitation, and Rutgers eventually declined and remained in the Atlantic 10 Conference (then known as the Eastern 8 Conference). Seton Hall was then invited as a replacement and the conference started play with seven members.\nVillanova and Pittsburgh joined shortly thereafter under the leadership of the first Big East commissioner, Dave Gavitt.\nThe conference remained largely unchanged until 1991, when it began to sponsor football, adding Miami as a full member, and Rutgers, Temple, Virginia Tech, and West Virginia as football-only members. Rutgers and West Virginia were offered full all-sports membership in 1995, while Virginia Tech waited until 2000 for the same offer. Temple football was kicked out after the 2004 season, but rejoined in 2012 and intended to become a full member in 2013.\nThe unusual structure of the Big East, with the \"football\" and \"non-football\" schools, led to instability in the conference. The waves of defection and replacement brought about by the conference realignments of 2005 and the early 2010s revealed tension between the football-sponsoring and non-football schools that eventually led to the split of the conference in 2013.\n\n\n=== Realignment and reorganization ===\n\nThe conference was reorganized following the tumultuous period of realignment that hobbled the Big East between 2010 and 2013. The Big East was one of the most severely impacted conferences during the early-2010s conference realignment period. In all, 14 member schools announced their departure for other conferences, and 15 other schools announced plans to join the conference (eight as all-sports members, and four for football only). Three of the latter group later backed out of their plans to join (one for all sports, and the other two for football only).\nOn December 15, 2012, the Big East's seven remaining non-FBS schools, all Catholic institutions consisting of DePaul, Georgetown, Marquette, Providence, St. John's, Seton Hall, a\nThe Big 12 Conference is a group of 16 (originally 12) universities which compete in the NCAA Division I level.  The conference was formed in 1994 but did not begin conference play until the fall of 1996.  The schools that composed the Big 12 Conference in the most recent 2022–23 season, except West Virginia, were members of either the Big Eight Conference or the Southwest Conference, and have won six national titles including three titles since the inception of the Big 12 Conference.\nThe conference expanded to 16 members in the 2024–25 season with the return of charter-member Colorado, and the arrival of Arizona, Arizona State, and Utah.\n\n\n== Membership ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\n\n\n=== Former members ===\n\n\n== Standings ==\n\n\n=== All-time records ===\n\nTotals though the end of the 2023-24 season.\n\n\n=== Overall series records in Big 12 Play ===\n1997 - 2024 as Big 12 Members\nSource:Note: Some of the values from the bottom of page 32 don't match with the detailed numbers given on pages 33–41 so that latter values were used: *\n\nTotals though the end of the 2023–24 season.

It was formed in January 1907 as the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MVIAA) by its charter member schools: the University of Kansas, University of Missouri, University of Nebraska, and Washington University in St. Louis. Additionally, the University of Iowa was an original member of the MVIAA, while maintaining joint membership in the Western Conference (now the Big Ten Conference).\nThe conference's membership at its dissolution consisted of the University of Nebraska, Iowa State University, the University of Colorado at Boulder, the University of Kansas, Kansas State University, the University of Missouri, the University of Oklahoma, and Oklahoma State University. The Big Eight's headquarters were located in Kansas City, Missouri.\nIn February 1994, all eight members of the Big Eight Conference and four of the members of the Southwest Conference announced that the 12 schools had reached an agreement to form the Big 12 Conference. From a conventional standpoint, the Big 12 was a renamed and expanded Big Eight. But from a legal standpoint, the Big Eight ceased operations in 1996, and its members joined with the four SWC schools (Texas, Texas A&M, Baylor, and Texas Tech) to form the Big 12 the following year.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation ===\nThe conference was founded as the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MVIAA) at a meeting on January 12, 1907, of five charter member institutions: the University of Kansas, the University of Missouri, the University of Nebraska, Washington University in St. Louis, and the University of Iowa, which also maintained its concurrent membership in the Western Conference (now the Big Ten Conference). However, Iowa only participated in football and outdoor men's track and field for a brief period before leaving the conference in 1911.\n\n\n=== Early membership changes ===\nIn 1908, Drake University and Iowa Agricultural College (now Iowa State University) joined the MVIAA, increasing the conferences membership to seven. Iowa, which was a joint member, departed the conference in 1911 to return to sole competition in the Western Conference, but Kansas State University joined the conference in 1913. Nebraska left in 1918 to play as an independent for two seasons before returning in 1920. In 1919, the University of Oklahoma and Saint Louis University applied for membership, but were not approved due to deficient management of their athletic programs. The conference then added Grinnell College in 1919, with the University of Oklahoma applying again and being approved in 1920. Oklahoma A&M University (now Oklahoma State University) joined in 1925, bringing conference membership to ten, an all-time high.\n\n\n=== Split into Big Six Conference ===\nAt a meeting in Lincoln, Nebraska, on May 19, 1928, the conference split up. Six of the seven state schools (all except Oklahoma A&M) formed a conference that was initially known as the Big Six Conference. Just before the start of fall practice, the six schools announced they would retain the MVIAA name for formal purposes. However, fans and media continued to call it the Big Six. The three private schools – Drake, Grinnell, and Washington University – joined with Oklahoma A&M to form the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC). The old MVIAA's administrative staff transferred to the MVC.\nThe similarity of the two conferences' official names, as well as the competing claims of the two conferences, led to considerable debate over which conference was the original and which was the spin-off, though the MVIAA went on to become the more prestigious of the two. For the remainder of the Big Eight's run, both conferences claimed 1907 as their founding date, as well as the same history through 1927. To this day, it has never been definitively established which conference was the original.\n\nThe Big 12 Conference sponsors championships in 25 sports, 10 men's and 15 women's, with two women's sports to be added in the 2024–25 school year. The first conference championship awarded was the 1996 softball postseason tournament championship, which was won by Oklahoma.\nFrom 2011 through 2016, the football champion was decided by regular-season play. Previously divisional titles were awarded based on regular-season conference results, with the teams with the best conference records from the North and South playing in the Big 12 Championship Game for the Big 12 title. Following changes in NCAA rules, the Big 12 will reinstate its football championship game in 2017, with the top two teams in the final conference standings advancing to the title game. Baseball, basketball, soccer, and tennis titles are awarded in both regular-season and tournament play. Cross country, golf, gymnastics, rowing, swimming and diving, track and field, and wrestling titles are awarded during an annual meet of participating teams. The volleyball and softball titles are awarded based on regular-season play. Softball previously held a post season tournament.\n\n\n== Membership ==\n\n\n=== Current membership ===\n\n\n=== Former members ===\n\nAssociate members joining in 2024:\n\nWomen's lacrosse\nFlorida Gators\nSan Diego State Aztecs\nUC Davis Aggies\nWomen's rowing\nOld Dominion Monarchs\nTulsa Golden Hurricane\nWrestling\nOklahoma Sooners\n\n\n== Baseball ==\n\nAll current Big 12 members sponsor baseball except Iowa State, which dropped the sport after the 2001 season, and Colorado, which never sponsored baseball during its first conference tenure and still does not sponsor the sport.\n\n\n== Men's basketball ==\n\n\n== Women's basketball ==\n\n\n== Beach volleyball ==\nBeach volleyball, organized by the NCAA only for women, is the first of two women's sports to be added in 2024–25.

As a result, the following teams are also recognized as champions by the Big 12:\nNorth Co-Champions: Kansas State (1999), Nebraska (2000, 2001, 2008), Iowa State (2004), Kansas (2007), Missouri (2010)\nSouth Co-Champions: Texas (2002, 2008), Texas Tech (2008), Oklahoma State (2010), Texas A&M (2010)\n\n2011–2016\nWhen Nebraska and Colorado left the conference after the 2010 season, it left the conference with only 10 members. The conference did not replace the two teams and therefore eliminated the Big 12 Championship game. Under the new format, which remained in place through the 2016 season, every team played each other and the team with the best conference record won the Big 12 title. In the event of a tie b\nThis is a list of yearly Big 12 Conference football champions. Champions are determined in a head to head matchup in the Big 12 Championship Game held at the end of the regular season. The game was played each year since the conference's formation in 1996 until 2010 and returned during the 2017 season. From 1996 to 2010 the championship game pitted the Big 12 North Division champion against the South Division champion in a game held after the regular season was completed.\nBetween 2011 and 2016, the championship was earned in round-robin regular-season play among all conference members. Until 2014, the league did not employ tiebreaking procedures, such as head-to-head results, to determine a single champion, and thus it was not unusual for a season to end with \"co-champions.\" However with the 2015 season, head-to-head results will decide if two teams finish tied.\nFrom 2017 onward, the championship game features the two teams with the best conference records. The champion usually is invited to the Sugar Bowl unless selected to play in one of the national semifinals for the College Football Playoff. Co-champions are listed in alphabetical order. Co-champions are no longer possible as the Big 12 Conference has switched to using a Conference Championship game to determine the winner.\n\n\n== Champions by year ==\n\nBold indicates a national championship.\n\n\n== Championships by team ==\n\nItalics indicate a shared title.\n* indicates a school no longer competing in the Big 12.\n\n\n== Big 12 Championship Game ==\n\nSince 2017, the championship game has determined the conference champion.

Founded as the Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives in 1896, it predates the founding of its regulating organization, the NCAA. It is based in the Chicago area in Rosemont, Illinois. For many decades the conference consisted of ten prominent universities, which accounts for its name. On August 2, 2024, the conference expanded to 18 member institutions and 2 affiliate institutions. The conference competes in the NCAA Division I and its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), formerly known as Division I-A, the highest level of NCAA competition in that sport.\nBig Ten member institutions are major research universities with large financial endowments and strong academic reputations. A large student body is a hallmark of its universities, as 15 of the 18 members enroll more than 30,000 students. They are all public universities except Northwestern University and the University of Southern California, both private universities. Collectively, Big Ten universities educate more than 520,000 total students and have 5.7 million living alumni. The members engage in $9.3 billion in funded research each year; 17 out of 18 are members of the Association of American Universities (except Nebraska) and the Universities Research Association (except USC). All Big Ten universities are also members of the Big Ten Academic Alliance, formerly the Committee on Institutional Cooperation.\nAlthough the Big Ten has primarily been a Midwestern conference for nearly a century, the conference's geographic footprint has extended from the Mid-Atlantic to the Great Plains since 2014. In 2024, the conference gained a presence in the West Coast with the addition of four former Pac-12 Conference schools.\n\n\n== Member universities ==\n\n\n=== Current full members ===\n\nNotes:\n\n\n=== Membership map ===\n\n\n=== Affiliate members ===\n\nNotes\n\n\n=== Former member ===\nThe University of Chicago is the only full member to have permanently left the Big Ten Conference.\n\nNotes\n\n\n=== Membership timeline ===\n\nFull members  Full members (non-football)  Sport affiliate  Other conference  Other conference \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nAs intercollegiate football rapidly increased during the 1890s, so did the ruthless nature of the game. Tempers flared, fights erupted, and injuries soared. Between 1880 and 1905, college football players suffered more than 325 deaths and 1,149 injuries.  To deal with mounting criticism of the game, Purdue University president James Henry Smart invited the presidents of the University of Chicago, University of Illinois, Lake Forest College, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University, and University of Wisconsin to a meeting in Chicago on January 11, 1895, to create policies aimed at regulating intercollegiate athletics. The eligibility of student-athletes was one of the main topics of discussion. The Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives was founded at a second meeting on February 8, 1896. Lake Forest was not at the 1896 meeting and was replaced by the University of Michigan. At the time, the organization was more commonly known as the Western Conference, consisting of Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Chicago, Purdue, and Northwestern. These schools were the original seven members.\nThe conference is one of the nation's oldest, predating the founding of the NCAA by a decade and was one of the first collegiate conferences to sponsor men's basketball.\nThe first reference to the conference as the Big Nine was in 1899 after Iowa and Indiana had joined. Nebraska first petitioned to join the league in 1900 and again in 1911, but was turned away both times.\nIn 1905, the conference was officially incorporated as the \"Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives\".\nIn April 1907, Michiga\nThe 2023 Big 12 Conference football season was the 28th season of the Big 12 Conference football taking place during the 2023 NCAA Division I FBS football season.\nThe 2023 season was the first season for the Big 12 to have 14 members, with BYU, Cincinnati, Houston, and UCF joining the conference. It was also the last season for founding conference members Oklahoma and Texas, who left for the Southeastern Conference prior to the start of the 2024 season.\nThe 2023 Big 12 Championship Game was played at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas on December 2, 2023, between Texas and Oklahoma State. Texas won 49–21, winning their fourth Big 12 championship in team history.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Previous season ===\nThe Kansas State Wildcats defeated the TCU Horned Frogs in overtime 31–28 in the Big 12 title game.\nEight teams participated in bowl games, finishing with a record of 2–7.

They are part of the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of NCAA Division I, the highest level of collegiate football in the nation, and are considered the most elite conferences within that tier. Power conferences have provided most of the participants in the College Football Playoff since its inception, and generally have larger revenue, budgets, and television viewership than other college athletic programs.\nThe grouping currently consists of the Power Four conferences of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), Big Ten Conference, Big 12 Conference, and Southeastern Conference (SEC) as a result of the collapse of the Pac-12 Conference amid widespread conference realignment following the 2023 season. There are also suggestions from sportswriters that the Big Ten and SEC currently form a \"Power Two\" tier above the ACC and Big 12, with further moves and realignment sure to come in the future.\nThe conferences were known as the Power Five during the 4-team College Football Playoff (CFP) era and the later years of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). The BCS began in 1998 with six Automatic Qualifying conferences of the ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Big East, SEC, and Pac-12. The Big East's loss of stature during realignment in 2005 resulted in the term \"Power Five\" being used to refer to the remaining top tier of teams.\nThe FBS consists of the Power Four, five other conferences known as the Group of Five (G5), the two-member Pac-12 Conference, and a small number of independent schools. The term Power Conference is not defined by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), but the Power Four conferences are identified individually under NCAA rules as \"autonomy conferences\", which grants them some independence from standard NCAA rules to provide additional resources for the benefit of student-athletes. The power conferences also compete in numerous sports outside of football, but are not necessarily the most prominent conferences in each individual sport. For example, in men's college basketball, the modern Big East Conference is also generally considered to be a power conference.\nEach of the power conferences existed for decades before the establishment of the College Football Playoff, with the oldest power conference, the Big Ten, founded in 1896. By the middle of the 20th century, the top conferences sent teams to postseason bowl games such as the Rose Bowl or the Sugar Bowl, but the bowl season frequently ended with multiple teams claiming the national championship. In 1998, the current Power Four conferences joined with the Pac-12, the original incarnation of the Big East Conference, Notre Dame, and several leading bowl games to create the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). The BCS determined the college football FBS national champion until it was supplanted by the College Football Playoff in 2014, and each of the six founding conferences were known as \"automatic qualifying\" conferences since they received an automatic bid to one of the BCS bowl games. After the Big East lost several members and split into two conferences in 2013, its football successor, the American Athletic Conference, became part of the Group of Five. The Pac-12 was a member of the Power Five conferences but lost its autonomy conference status and most of its membership in 2024, leading to the current state of four power conferences.\n\n\n== List of conferences and teams ==\n\nThe ten FBS conferences as of the 2024–2025 academic year are listed.

The conference's members participated in 24 NCAA sports. The conference had a history of success at the national level in basketball throughout its history, while its shorter (1991 to 2013) football program, created by inviting one college and four other \"associate members\" (their football programs only) into the conference, resulted in two national championships.\nIn basketball, Big East teams made 18 Final Four appearances and won 7 NCAA championships as Big East members through 2013 (UConn with three, Georgetown, Syracuse, Louisville and Villanova with one each). Of the Big East's full members, all but South Florida attended the Final Four, the most of any conference, though Marquette, DePaul, Notre Dame, Rutgers, Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh made all their trips before joining the Big East. In 2011, the Big East set the record for the most teams sent to the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship by a single conference with eleven out of their sixteen teams qualifying.\nIn football, the Big East entered competition as a conference in 1991, after inviting five football colleges to become members of the Big East, joining three teams from the Big East whose football teams were competing as Division I independents (Boston College, Pittsburgh and Syracuse) to form a new Division I football league. The strength of this league earned the Big East an automatic berth in the Bowl Championship Series, when that series was created in 1998. The Big East won two national football championships, both by University of Miami. Between 2005 and 2012, four of the more successful football schools left the Big East for other conferences, starting a process that led to a complete realignment of the Big East in 2013.\nOn July 1, 2013, the non-football playing schools (also known collectively as the Catholic 7) formed a non-football playing conference that purchased the Big East Conference name. The remaining six football-playing members, three of whom had only joined the Big East in 2005 when the earlier exodus had started, joined with four schools from other conferences to become the American Athletic Conference (The American/AAC), which is the Big East's legal successor. The American retains the Big East's football structure and inherited its single automatic berth in the Bowl Championship Series. However, both conferences claim 1979 as their founding date, and the same history up to 2013.  As of the 2023–24 season, South Florida is the only full member of the original Big East that still plays in the AAC today.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding: the early years ===\nThe Big East, often referred to as the Classic Big East, was founded in 1979 after new NCAA basketball scheduling requirements caused the athletic directors of independent schools Providence, St. John's, Georgetown, and Syracuse to discuss the creation of a conference centered in the Northeast. Other schools invited were Seton Hall, Connecticut, Holy Cross, Rutgers, and Boston College, with Rutgers and Holy Cross declining to join. Villanova joined a year later in 1980 and Pittsburgh joined in 1982. Before the formation of the conference, many of these schools participated in the ECAC men's basketball tournament in order to receive an automatic bid for the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship.\nIn 1982, Penn State applied for membership, but was rejected, with only five schools in favor (Penn State needed six out of eight). It was long rumored that Syracuse cast the deciding vote against Penn State, but Mike Tranghese confirmed that this was not the case and that Syracuse had, in fact, voted for Penn State's inclusion.  Penn State would loom large over the conference during future rounds of realignment as the Nittany Lions had the potential to shore up the conference once football members began to join.  Followin\nThe 2024–25 Big 12 men's basketball season will begin with the start of the 2024–25 NCAA Division I men's basketball season in November. Regular season conference play will begin in December 2024 and conclude in March 2025. The 2025 Big 12 Conference men's basketball tournament will be held March, 2025, at the T-Mobile Center in Kansas City, Missouri.\nThis will be the first season for the Big 12 Conference with 16 teams after the addition of Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado and Utah, plus the departure of Oklahoma and Texas.\n\n\n== Coaches ==\n\n\n=== Coaching changes ===\n\n\n=== Head coaches ===\nNote: Stats are through the beginning of the season.

All 10 FBS conferences that existed at the start of the realignment cycle have seen or will see changes in their core membership.\nThe Associated Press named conference realignment, and in particular the collapse of the Pac-12 Conference, as the 2023 story of the year in U.S. sports. The Pac-12 Conference lost ten of its twelve members ahead of the 2024-25 academic year, leading to lawsuits and to ad-hoc arrangements for its remaining two members until newly invited members could join in 2026.\nThe Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) also saw significant changes, most notably the beginning of football sponsorship by the Atlantic Sun Conference (ASUN); the return of football by the Western Athletic Conference (WAC), which previously sponsored football at the FBS level until the end of the 2012 season; and two football-only conference mergers, one involving the ASUN and WAC and the other involving the Big South Conference and Ohio Valley Conference (OVC).\nOther sports saw significant change:\n\nIn men's ice hockey, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) was reestablished by seven members of the men's Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA), which led to the WCHA disbanding its men's league and becoming a women-only conference. Also, the men-only Atlantic Hockey Association and the women-only College Hockey America announced they would merge into a single conference, later unveiled as Atlantic Hockey America, after the 2023–24 season.\nIn men's soccer, the Sun Belt Conference reinstated the sport, ultimately leading to both Conference USA (CUSA) and the Mid-American Conference dropping the sport, and the OVC also added the sport.\nThe Atlantic 10 Conference launched a men's lacrosse league, leading to the Northeast Conference (NEC) and the Southern Conference dropping the sport. However, the NEC later reinstated men's lacrosse in 2024–25.\nThe NEC became the second D-I all-sports conference to sponsor men's volleyball.\nThe West Coast Conference and the Big West Conference added men's water polo, which led to the demise of the men's side of the water polo-only Golden Coast Conference.\nIn men's wrestling, the Ivy League announced it would hold its own conference championship meet starting in 2024–25, ending a century-long de facto relationship with the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association.\nThe Mountain West Conference began sponsoring women's gymnastics, leading to the demise of the single-sport Mountain Rim Gymnastics Conference.\nSeveral all-sports conferences underwent single-sport mergers or transfers of sponsorship:\nThe OVC merged its men's tennis league into the Horizon League.\nThe Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference merged its baseball league into the NEC.\nThe Southland Bowling League was absorbed by CUSA.\nThe ASUN added men's and women's swimming & diving, effectively taking over the aquatics side of the Coastal Collegiate Sports Association and leaving the latter a beach volleyball-only conference.\nSponsorship of men's swimming & diving transferred from the Mid-American Conference to the Missouri Valley Conference.\n\n\n== FBS conferences affected ==\n\n\n=== Southeastern Conference ===\nOn July 21, 2021, the Houston Chronicle reported that Oklahoma and Texas had approached the Southeastern Conference (SEC) about the possibility of joining that league. On July 26, Oklahoma and Texas notified the Big 12 Conference that the two schools did not wish to extend their grant of television rights beyond the 2024–25 athletic year and intended to leave the conference. On July 29, the presidents and chancellors of the 14 SEC members voted unanimously to extend invitations to Oklahoma and Texas, effective in 2025. The two schools eventually reached a buyout agreement with the Big 12 t\nThe Colorado Buffaloes football program represents the University of Colorado Boulder in college football at the NCAA Division I FBS level, and is a member of the Big 12 Conference. The team was a charter member of the Big 12 before leaving to join the Pac-12 Conference after the 2010 season. After 13 seasons in the Pac-12, the Buffaloes returned to the Big 12 in 2024. Before joining the Big 12, they were members of the Big Eight Conference. The CU football team has played at Folsom Field since 1924.  The Buffs all-time record is 716–520–36 (.577 winning percentage) as of the 2022 season. Colorado won the 1990 National Championship.  The football program is 27th on the all-time win list and 40th in all-time winning percentage.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBeginning in 1890, the Buffaloes have appeared in 29 bowl games (36th all-time), and won 27 conference championships, 5 division championships and an AP national championship in 1990.\nFolsom Field was built in 1924, and since then, Colorado has a 308–169–14 record at home through the 2016 season. The road game against the Nebraska Cornhuskers on November 24, 2006, was Colorado's 1,100th football game.

While the Georgia Tech won the United Press International Coaches Poll, Colorado won the Associated Press, Football Writers Association of America and other polls.  Colorado played the most difficult schedule in the country, beat more ranked teams and conference champions, and had a more talented roster. Colorado capped the season with a 10–9 win over Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl, a rematch of the 1989 season Orange Bowl Game which Notre Dame won 21–6. Colorado's tie came against Tennessee, who was ranked No. 8, the first week of the season when Colorado was ranked No. 5. The second week gave the Buffs a scare, scoring with 12 seconds left in the game on a 4th and Goal attempt. The next week gave Colorado its only loss of the season, losing 23–22 to Illinois and dropping Colorado to No. 20 in the polls. Colorado then went on to beat teams ranked (at the time) No. 22 Texas, No. 12 Washington, No. 22 Oklahoma, and No. 3 Nebraska. They ended the season 7–0 in the Big Eight Conference for the second straight season. They then capped the season with a win over Notre Dame who were number 1 until a loss in their second to last game of the regular season.\n\n\n=== Conference championships ===\n\nColorado has won 26 conference championships in over a century of college play, spanning through five conferences.\n\n† Co-champions\n\n\n=== Division championships ===\n\n† Co-champions\n\n\n== Head coaches ==\n\nThe Buffaloes have played in 1,109 games during their 125 seasons, through 2014.

Seeding is based on regular season records.\nThe winner of the tournament receives the Big 12 Conference automatic bid to the NCAA Championship tournament.\nBetween 2005 and 2019, no current Big 12 member besides Iowa State or Kansas won the tournament, and those two schools have won 18 of 27 titles. The remaining current Big 12 schools only account for six additional tournament titles. For its first twenty-three years, no school from outside the original Big Eight Conference had ever won the tournament. This streak ended when the Texas Longhorns won the championship game against Oklahoma State in 2021.\nThe tournament is set to be held at the T-Mobile Center (formerly Sprint Center) in Kansas City, Missouri until 2031.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe tournament has been held every year since the first full basketball season was completed in 1997. (The Big 12 was formed in 1996)  Since that time, it was held in Kemper Arena in Kansas City, Missouri in early March for every year up until 2003, and also in 2005. In 2003, 2004, and 2006 it was held at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas, and in 2007 it was held in the Ford Center at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In 2008 it was again held in Kansas City, but this time at the Sprint Center.\nThe 2009 edition of the championship was held in Oklahoma City, with the event returning to Kansas City from 2010 through 2020. On October 24, 2018, it was announced that the Big 12 Tournament would stay in Kansas City through 2024, and on June 12, 2020, it was announced that it would stay in Kansas City through 2025.

Part of a larger NCAA conference realignment that began in the 2010–11 academic year and continued through 2013–14, the Big 12 was one of the more severely impacted conferences. In all, four schools left during this cycle (Colorado, Missouri, Nebraska, Texas A&M) and two joined (West Virginia, TCU).\n\n\n== First wave ==\nNebraska announced that it would leave the Big 12 Conference for the Big Ten Conference effective in 2011.\nColorado also announced a change in conference alignment; originally planning to transfer to the Pac-10 for the 2012–13 season, the school agreed to depart a year early after Nebraska announced its plans to depart the conference in 2011.\nWith the loss of Colorado (who had been a member of the Big 12 and its predecessor the Big Eight Conference since 1947) to the Pac-10 and Nebraska (whose association with the Big 12 dates back to the 1907 founding of what was to become the Big Eight) to the Big Ten, the Big 12 was reduced to ten teams and faced more possible attrition.\nOther Big 12 schools were rumored to be candidates for expansion by other conferences, including further expansion by the Pac-10 or Big Ten. Speculation and rumors centered on Texas, Texas Tech, Oklahoma, and Oklahoma State following Colorado to the Pac-10. Texas A&M was also considered as a PAC-10 candidate but was also reportedly considering a move to the SEC.\nESPN reported on June 11 that Texas, Texas Tech, and the two Oklahoma schools were prepared to accept an invitation from the Pac-10. The report also indicated that Texas A&M was torn between the Pac-10 and SEC and was given a 72-hour deadline to decide on its future destination. Meanwhile, Baylor announced that it would wait and see what the final outcome of the Big 12's realignment would be before making any final decision concerning where they would go if the Big 12 dissolved. On June 14, ESPN, citing sources within the Big 12, initially reported that Texas, Texas Tech, Oklahoma, and Oklahoma State would join the Pac-10 no later than June 15, while Texas A&M was now most likely to opt for the SEC. The remaining Big 12 schools Baylor, Iowa State, Kansas, Kansas State, and Missouri may have been left to find new leagues, with early speculation pointing to a possible move for some of those schools to the Mountain West or Big East conferences. Kansas men's basketball coach Bill Self stated, on the day that TCU announced its entry into the Big East, that had the Big 12 collapsed the Big East would have offered membership to Kansas, Kansas State, Iowa State, and Missouri.\nOn June 14, reports started surfacing that the almost certain departure of Texas (and, along with them, several other schools) from the Big 12 would not happen. Indications were that a last-minute effort by Big 12 Commissioner Dan Beebe to hold the 10-remaining Big 12 teams together might be successful. Beebe's plan showed that the remaining 10 schools could nearly double their television revenue if they stuck with the Big 12. In addition, Beebe said that Texas would be allowed to start its own network if the school stayed with the Big 12—a business move that Texas has wanted to do that would not be allowed in the Pac-10. If Texas decided to stay with the Big 12, that had the potential to effectively end any further realignment in the NCAA, save for one or two moves in the Pac-10 and Mountain West Conference. However, others were saying that while Texas might want to keep the Big 12 together with this deal, the remaining Big 12 South teams that were considering departing the Big 12 (Texas Tech, Texas A&M, Oklahoma and Oklahoma State) would not be interested in a deal that would give a school that already has a competitive advantage an even larger one.\nLater that day, Andy Katz of ESPN.com, citing an NCAA sour",
