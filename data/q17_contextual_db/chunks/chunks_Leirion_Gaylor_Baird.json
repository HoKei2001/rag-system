        "content": "Leirion Gaylor Baird is an American politician. Since the 2019 election, she has been the mayor of Lincoln, Nebraska, where she previously served as a city councilwoman.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nGaylor Baird grew up in Portland, Oregon; her parents were public school teachers. She completed a Bachelor of Arts in history from Yale College in 1993. She earned a Master of Science in comparative social policy from University of Oxford in 1997.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBaird began her career as a management consultant, working also as a city budget and policy analyst. She was the director of an after-school and summer program in San Francisco. Upon moving to Lincoln, Nebraska, she was appointed to the Lincoln/Lancaster County Planning Commission and helped develop its 2040 Comprehensive Plan. She was elected to the Lincoln City Council as a city-wide representative in May 2013 and was, at the time, its only female member. She won reelection in 2017.\nFollowing the ratification of a term limit amendment by referendum, Baird announced her intention to succeed incumbent three-term Mayor Chris Beutler. Affiliated with the Democratic Party, she officially ran as a nonpartisan candidate due to municipal election law. She won the election for mayor on May 7, 2019, against Republican-affiliated Cyndi Lamm. She was sworn in on May 20, 2019, alongside the new city council.\n\n\n== Political positions and mayoralty ==\nDuring her campaign for the mayoralty, Baird campaigned on additional road funding for the city, environmental preservation, and community land trusts for housing. During her time as a city councilwoman, she introduced legislation to ban bump stocks in the city.\nA recall against Baird was organized in October 2020. LNK Recall objected to the suspension of city charter rules that allowed Pat Lopez to be designated as health director. Organizers needed at least 21,652 signatures by December 23, 2020, to trigger a recall election; they were unable to do so. Baird responded by saying she continued to work as mayor.\nBaird was reelected in the 2023 mayoral election. Her two opponents in the primary were Republican state senator Suzanne Geist and Republican Stan Parker.\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n=== 2019 ===\n\n\n=== 2023 ===\n\n\n== References ==\nThe 2023 United States elections were held, in large part, on Tuesday, November 7, 2023. The off-year election included gubernatorial and state legislative elections in a few states, as well as numerous citizen initiatives, mayoral races, and a variety of other local offices on the ballot. At least three special elections to the United States Congress were scheduled as either deaths or vacancies arose. The Democratic Party retained control of the governorship in Kentucky, flipped the Wisconsin Supreme Court and held a seat on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, gained six seats in the New Jersey General Assembly, and won back unified control of the Virginia General Assembly, while Republicans also flipped the governorship in Louisiana and narrowly retained Mississippi's governorship. The election cycle also saw Ohio voting to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution and legalize cannabis for recreational use. The results were widely seen as a success for the Democratic Party.\nThe election cycle was generally marked by a trend of strong Democratic overperformances in special elections. Daily Kos and FiveThirtyEight analyses of at least 38 races in September 2023 determined that the party outperformed the partisan lean by an average of 10 percent. In comparison, Democrats outperformed by an average of 4 percent in elections held between the 2018 and 2020 elections, and an average of 7.6 percent in elections held in 2020. The 2023 overperformances consisted of unusually larger margins of victory in races held in safely Democratic areas and unusually smaller margins of defeat in races held in safely Republican areas. The results indicate a suburban shift among affluent, college-educated voters that started as an underlying reaction to Donald Trump's election in 2016. While the results were generally in line with predictions, Democrats still outperformed expectations despite the low approval ratings of incumbent Democratic president Joe Biden and polls indicating his middling prospects in the 2024 presidential election.\nBoth Democratic and Republican operatives attributed the Democrats' overperformance streak to general support of broad abortion rights in the wake of the Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision. This marked a continuing trend of bipartisan voter support for ballot initiatives on abortion rights since the June 2022 decision. Many conservative political analysts and commentators called a continued Republican alliance with the anti-abortion movement \"untenable\" and an \"electoral disaster\", and urged the party to favor abortion rights. Young voters in particular gave overwhelming support for abortion rights. Among voters between 18 and 29 years old in increasingly Republican Ohio, an estimated 77% voted for Ohio Issue 1, including a majority of Republicans. Exit polling indicated Ohioans believed abortion should be \"mostly legal\" by a margin of 61–36%.\n\n\n== Federal elections ==\n\n\n=== House of Representatives ===\n\nThree special elections were held in 2023 to fill vacancies during the 118th U.S. Congress.\n\nVirginia's 4th congressional district: Democrat Jennifer McClellan defeated Republican Leon Benjamin in the February special election, to succeed Donald McEachin  who died on November 28, 2022, of colorectal cancer. The district has a partisan index of D+16.\nRhode Island's 1st congressional district: Democrat Gabe Amo defeated Republican Gerry Leonard Jr. to succeed David Cicilline, who resigned on May 31, 2023, to become the president and CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation. The district has a partisan index of D+14.\nUtah's 2nd congressional district: Republican Celeste Maloy defeated State Senator Kathleen Riebe, as well as five independent candidates, to succeed Republican Chris Stewart, who resigned on September 15, 2023, due to his wife's ongoing health issues. The district has a partisan index of R+11.\n\n\n== State elections ==\n\n\n=== Gubernatorial elections ===\n\nThree states held g\nThe 2023 Lincoln, Nebraska mayoral election was held on May 2, 2023 to determine the mayor of Lincoln, Nebraska. It was preceded by a primary election on April 4 where the top two vote-getters, regardless of party affiliation, advanced to the general election. Incumbent Democratic mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird ran for reelection to a second term in office, and was re-elected. The election was officially nonpartisan.\n\n\n== Primary election ==\n\n\n=== Declared ===\nLeirion Gaylor Baird, incumbent mayor (2019–present) (party affiliation: Democratic)\nSuzanne Geist, former Nebraska state senator (2017–2023) (party affiliation: Republican)\nStan Parker, Christian radio executive and former University of Nebraska football player (party affiliation: Republican)\n\n\n=== Declined ===\nJack Riggins, KLIN radio host (party affiliation: Republican)\n\n\n=== Endorsements ===\n\n\n=== Results ===\n\nAn additional 670 mailed ballots were received by the Election Commission in the days following the primary election, too late to be counted.\n\n\n== General election ==\n\n\n=== Candidates ===\nLeirion Gaylor Baird, incumbent mayor (Democratic)\nSuzanne Geist, former Nebraska state senator (Republican)\n\n\n=== Debate ===\n\n\n=== Endorsements ===\n\n\n=== Results ===\n\nFollowing the second hourly results pull, Leirion Gaylor Baird was declared the winner and Suzanne Geist conceded.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial campaign websites\nLeirion Gaylor Baird (D) for Mayor\nSuzanne Geist (R) for Mayor\nStan Parker (R) for Mayor\nThe 2019 United States elections were held, in large part, on Tuesday, November 5, 2019. This off-year election included gubernatorial elections in Kentucky, Louisiana, and Mississippi; regularly-scheduled state legislative elections in Louisiana, Mississippi, Virginia, and New Jersey; and special elections for seats in various state legislatures. Numerous citizen initiatives, mayoral races, and a variety of other local elections also occurred. Three special elections to the United States House of Representatives also took place in 2019 as a result of vacancies.\nDemocrats regained the governorship of Kentucky and held the office in Louisiana, despite strong campaign efforts by President Donald Trump for the Republican candidates. Democrats also took control of the state legislature in Virginia. Republicans held the governor's mansion in Mississippi and expanded their control of the Louisiana state legislature and gained seats in the New Jersey state legislature. A major theme in the election results was a suburban revolt against Trump and the Republican Party in general, as these areas swung heavily towards Democratic candidates in local, state, and federal elections.\n\n\n== Federal special elections ==\n\nThree special elections were held in 2019 to fill vacancies during the 116th United States Congress:\n\nPennsylvania's 12th congressional district: Republican Tom Marino resigned on January 23, 2019, to take a private sector job. The district has a partisan index of R+17. Republican state Rep. Fred Keller defeated Democrat Marc Friedenberg in the May 21 election, keeping the seat in Republican hands.\nNorth Carolina's 3rd congressional district: Republican Walter B. Jones Jr. died on February 10, 2019. The district has a partisan index of R+12. Republican state Rep. Greg Murphy was elected, defeating Democrat Allen M. Thomas and Libertarian Tim Harris.\nNorth Carolina's 9th congressional district: Due to allegations of election fraud, the results for the 9th congressional district were not certified for the 2018 election, leaving the seat vacant once the 116th Congress began (the seat was previously held by Republican Robert Pittenger, who lost his party's nomination in 2018). On February 21, 2019, the North Carolina State Board of Elections voted unanimously to hold a new election. The district has a partisan index of R+8. Republican state Sen. Dan Bishop was narrowly elected, defeating Democrat Dan McCready, Libertarian Jeff Scott, and Green Loran Allen Smith.\nAdditional vacancies occurred in Wisconsin's 7th Congressional district following the resignation of Republican Sean Duffy in September 2019; New York's 27th Congressional district following the October 2019 resignation of Republican Chris Collins ahead of his pleading guilty to insider trading; California's 25th Congressional district following the resignation of Democrat Katie Hill in November 2019; and Maryland's 7th Congressional district following the death of Democrat Elijah Cummings on October 17, 2019. Georgia Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson announced in August 2019 that he would resign on December 31, 2019, due to deteriorating health. Special elections to fill the seats occurred in 2020.\n\n\n=== Party switchers ===\nAlso during 2019, changes in partisan balance in the House of Representatives happened as the result of members of Congress switching their party affiliation. On July 4, 2019, Rep. Justin Amash declared he would leave the Republican Party but continue to serve in Congress as an independent, turning an evenly split Michigan delegation into a Democratic majority delegation. Following a week of speculation, on December 19, the day after voting against the impeachment of Donald Trump, Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey officially left the Democratic Party to become a Republican.\n\n\n== State elections ==\n\n\n=== Gubernatorial ===\n\nThree states held gubernatorial elections in 2019:\n\nKentucky: In the May 21 primaries, one-term incumbent Republican Matt Bevin faced a st\nKatharine Sarah Gallego (née Widland, born October 21, 1981) is an American politician serving as the 62nd mayor of Phoenix, Arizona, since 2019. A member of the Democratic Party, she previously served on the Phoenix City Council from 2014 to 2018.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn Katharine Sarah Widland, Gallego grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Her parents are attorneys who moved to Albuquerque from Chicago after the 1979 Chicago blizzard. She grew up with asthma, which made air quality important to her. Gallego is Jewish, celebrating her bat mitzvah in Albuquerque.\nGallego graduated from Albuquerque Academy, where she served as student body vice president. She earned a bachelor's degree in environmental science and public policy from Harvard College and a Master of Business Administration from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nGallego worked for the Arizona Democratic Party, the Arizona Office of Tourism, as well as on economic development and strategic planning for the Salt River Project.  On November 5, 2013, Gallego was elected to the Phoenix City Council for the 8th district; she was reelected in 2017. With Greg Stanton, the Mayor of Phoenix, running for the United States House of Representatives in the 2018 elections, Gallego announced she would run in a special election to succeed him. She resigned from the city council effective August 7, 2018.\n\n\n=== Elections ===\nThe city of Phoenix has nonpartisan mayoral elections. In the 2018 special election, Kate Gallego and Daniel Valenzuela advanced to a runoff in November 2018. They defeated Moses Sanchez and Nicholas Sarwark. Although the election was nonpartisan, both candidates were Democrats. Previously on the city council, they had voted similarly. Kate Gallego defeated Daniel Valenzuela in the special general runoff election for the mayor of Phoenix in 2019. She received 58.6% of votes. She assumed office on March 21, 2019. She is only the second female mayor in Phoenix history and one of the youngest big city mayors in the United States. She was backed by progressives, labor unions, the Arizona Republic editorial board, and liberal advocacy organizations. Examples of these include Emily's List, Sierra Club, and the Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona.\nIn 2020, Kate Gallego ran for re-election. In November 2020, she was returned to office with the highest number of votes ever cast in a mayoral election. Merissa Hamilton, a Libertarian write in candidate, was Gallego's closest opponent. Hamilton received 26.29% of votes. Gallego won the election receiving 60.7% of the votes. In March 2024, Gallego announced her intention to run for re-election for another term.\n\n\n=== Climate change ===\nDuring Gallego's tenure as mayor, Phoenix has taken steps to counter the urban heat island effects which are aggravated by climate change. Increasing temperatures in the Phoenix area are projected to cost billions of dollars per year. Among the steps being taken are the creation of \"cool corridors\" through the planting of desert-adapted trees, and the use of lighter-colored sidewalks and streets, particularly in areas with high pedestrian traffic and little shade. Where to plant the trees is determined in part based on \"tree equity.\" The city uses an interactive tool from the nonprofit American Forests that grades shade in neighborhoods based on satellite images. Phoenix has also opened one of the first city heat mitigation offices in the United States. It will support climate mitigation in Phoenix and share strategies with individuals and cities worldwide.\n\n\n=== Policing ===\nThe police department of Phoenix recorded shooting 44 people in 2018, spurring a reassessment from the community on police accountability. In 2020, Gallego suggested a plan for a citizens review board that would balance the police department interests and community interests. City councilman Carlos Garcia, who ran on further police accountability, created a plan\nThomas Frederick O'Connell (born 1976/1977) is an American politician and currently serves as the 10th Mayor of the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County.

The daughter of Taiwanese immigrants, she was the first Asian American woman to serve on the Boston City Council, from 2014 to 2021, and acted as its president from 2016–2018. She is the first woman and first non-white person to have been elected mayor of Boston. At 36 years of age, she was also the youngest individual to have been elected to the position in nearly a century. Wu is a member of the Democratic Party.\nWhile on the Boston City Council, Wu authored several ordinances that were enacted. This included an ordinance to prevent the city from contracting with health insurers that discriminate in their coverage against transgender individuals. She also authored ordinances to have the city protect wetlands, support adaption to climate change, enact a plastic bag ban, adopt Community Choice Aggregation, and provide paid parental leave to municipal employees. As a city councilor, Wu also partook in a successful effort to adopt regulations on short-term rentals.\nDuring her mayoralty, Wu has advocated for a municipal \"Green New Deal\" (the Boston Green New Deal) and signed an ordinance to divest city investments from companies that derive more than 15 percent of their revenue from fossil fuels, tobacco products, or prison facilities.

On the first day of the 86th Texas Legislature, he was chosen by his colleagues—Democrats and Republicans—to serve as president pro tempore. The position typically goes to the most senior member, regardless of party, who has not yet served as president pro tem, and is second in line of succession to the Governor.\nIt was announced by the Austin American-Statesman that Watson had planned to resign from the Texas Senate to become the first dean of the University of Houston's Hobby School of Public Affairs. His resignation was effective April 30, 2020. With incumbent Mayor Steve Adler not seeking another term, Watson entered the race to become Austin mayor for a second time. He was elected for his second stint as mayor in the 2022 Austin mayoral election runoff with 50.4% of the vote.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWatson was born in Oklahoma City and raised in Saginaw, Texas, a suburb of Fort Worth, where he attended Boswell High School.

Watson was an active Democrat throughout the 1990s and served as the chairman of the Travis County Democratic Party.\nIn 1991, Watson was appointed by Governor Ann Richards to serve as chairman of the Texas Air Control Board, the state agency that was charged with protecting air quality in Texas.  During his tenure, he worked to merge the agency with the Texas Air Control Board and the Texas Water Commission to form the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission, and oversaw implementation of the 1991 amendments to the federal Clean Air Act.\nIn 1994, he was named the Outstanding Young Lawyer of Texas. In 1997, Watson co-founded the Austin law firm of Watson Bishop London & Galow, creating a broad law practice that represented families, doctors, small businesses, and some of the state's major universities.\n\n\n== First term as Mayor of Austin (1997–2001) ==\nIn 1997, after Watson moved from Rollingwood to Austin, he was elected as the 54th mayor of Austin, a nonpartisan position. He ran on a pledge to build consensus in a city that was then dominated by political battles between environmentalists and developers. He campaigned to raise more than $78 million for land preservation and $300 million for transportation improvements. Watson's signature accomplishments as mayor included the transformation of Downtown Austin into a \"24-hour downtown\" by encouraging development of housing and retail in place of vacant warehouses and parking lots, partially through tax incentives and the city's Smart Growth initiatives.\nIn 1999, Watson spearheaded a redevelopment project along several blocks of waterfront property in Downtown Austin, in an effort to create a new public-private \"digital district\" in place of dilapidated warehouses and businesses including the former Liberty Lunch, which were demolished. Watson, along with architect Larry Speck, courted the Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) by offering a $10.4 million tax incentive to anchor two office buildings on the site in\nErin Mendenhall (born June 8, 1980) is an American politician and activist who has been serving as the mayor of Salt Lake City, Utah since 2020. Upon taking office as Salt Lake City’s 36th mayor, Mendenhall became the city’s third and youngest woman in the role (after Deedee Corradini and Jackie Biskupski). Prior to assuming office, Mendenhall represented the city’s 5th district on the Salt Lake City Council.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMendenhall was born in Arizona and moved to Sandy, Utah, when she was seven. Her father, Don, died from Hodgkin lymphoma when she was 14. She graduated from the University of Utah with a Bachelor of Arts degree in gender studies and a certificate in Non Profit Leadership and Management. In 2019, she earned a Master of Science degree in science and technology from the University of Utah.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nAfter college, Mendenhall conducted air-quality testing and internal auditing at Sterigenics, which sterilizes medical equipment.\nShe first entered politics as an air-quality activist with Utah Moms for Clean Air, but in 2010 moved on to co-found the non-profit Breathe Utah because \"she quickly realized she could more effectively fight for changes as someone sitting at the decision-making table rather than protesting outside the door.\"\n\n\n== City Council (2014–2020) ==\nMendenhall was elected to the Salt Lake City Council in November 2013 to represent District 5, which includes the Ballpark, Liberty Wells, Central 9th, and East Liberty Park neighborhoods. She took office in January 2014 and improving air quality became her signature issue. In May 2014, Mendenhall was appointed to the Utah Air Quality Board, which is the \"primary air quality policy maker for the State of Utah.\"\nIn 2015, Mendenhall and the City Council voted unanimously to cut campaign-finance limits, reducing the maximum contribution to a mayoral election from $7,500 to $3,500, and the maximum contribution to a City Council candidate from $1,600 to $750.\nIn July 2017, Mendenhall led on the passage of an ordinance to crack down on \"businesses that are hotbeds of crime.\" The ordinance was designed to close a loophole that led to stop motels and hotels on State Street allowing sex work and drug dealing without legal consequence. \"We are drawing a line in the sand,\" Mendenhall said.\nIn 2017, Mendenhall was re-elected to the City Council with 84% of the vote.\nIn November 2017, Mendenhall led the Salt Lake City Council to unanimously approve an ordnance limiting the capacity of homeless shelters to 200.\nIn March 2018, the Utah Legislature passed a bill that cut Salt Lake City out of the process of developing an inland port in the city’s Northwest Quadrant. The legislation also took 100% of the tax revenue generated from the Inland Port while denying the city’s mayor a seat on the Inland Port Authority and forcing the city to pay for police and fire department coverage of the area.\nIn July 2018, Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski withdrew from negotiations with the state government over the port project.  With the state moving the Port project forward without the city’s input, Mendenhall re-opened negotiations in her capacity as chair of the City Council.\nBased on those negotiations, on July 18, 2018, the Legislature passed additional legislation that required 10% of tax revenue generated by the inland port to be invested in affordable housing in Salt Lake City. The bill also required the Port to pay the city for its share of taxes needed to cover the cost of city services including police and fire.

It saw the election of Leirion Gaylor Baird.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIncumbent Democratic mayor Chris Beutler was prevented from running by a term-limits amendment to the city charter that was approved by voters on November 6, 2018. In the summer of 2018, several prominent Republican politicians successfully led a petition drive for an amendment to the city charter that would limit the Lincoln mayor to serving three consecutive terms. The amendment would apply retroactively, thereby prohibiting Beutler from running for a fourth term in the 2019 municipal election.\n\n\n== Primary ==\nThe primary was held on April 9.\n\n\n== General election ==\n\n\n== References ==\nChokwe Antar Lumumba (born March 29, 1983) is an American attorney, activist, and politician serving as the 53rd mayor of Jackson, Mississippi, the 7th consecutive African-American to hold the position.\nHe was first elected in 2017. In the primary election, Lumumba soundly won the Democratic nomination, defeating both incumbent mayor Tony Yarber and State Senator John Horhn. Lumumba went on to win the general election in a landslide. He is a self-described progressive and socialist. Lumumba has also referred to himself as a political revolutionary.\nHe is the son of former mayor and Black nationalist activist Chokwe Lumumba, who served briefly as mayor of Jackson before his death in 2014.\n\n\n== Mayor of Jackson, Mississippi ==\nLumumba was elected mayor in June 2017 with 93% of the vote. The Nation commented that \"Lumumba lit up the left press with his promise—delivered later that month in a speech at the People's Summit in Chicago—to make Jackson 'the most radical city on the planet.'\"\nIn summer 2018, Lumumba attended Michael Bloomberg's \"Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative.\" The City of Jackson noted that the Initiative was created by Bloomberg to train leaders to \"manage the complexities of running a city, and to have opportunities to learn from one another.\" Four months later, in November 2018, Bloomberg gave the City of Jackson $1 million to create art spotlighting food insecurity. Lumumba won reelection in 2021 with almost seventy percent of the vote.\n\n\n=== Jackson Zoo crisis ===\nIn April 2018, when the Jackson Zoo announced plans to consider moving from its current West Jackson location, Lumumba joined Working Together Jackson, the Zoo Area Progressive Partnership, Rosemont Missionary Baptist Church and other community groups, in an effort to prevent the zoo from moving. He described the proposed plan as disingenuous and disrespectful. A city investigation discovered that the Jackson Zoological Society had mismanaged funds and failed to pay $6 million in water bills.\nLumumba took direct control of the zoo and approved $200,000 to renovate it. The zoo reopened in August 2020 under city control.\n\n\n=== Jackson water crisis ===\nIn 2019, over 3 billion U.S. gallons (11 gigaliters) of raw sewage was released into the Pearl River, leading to the local government telling residents to avoid contact with the water by swimming or fishing.\nIn 2020, following a record-breaking amount of rain during the early months of the year, the city's sewage system once again overflowed and led to 1⁄2 billion U.S. gallons (1.9 gigaliters) of raw sewage, as well as 5.7 billion U.S. gallons (22 gigaliters) of treated sewage, being dumped into the Pearl River.\nIn March 2021, Lumumba wrote to Mississippi state governor Tate Reeves requesting $47M in aid needed to make the urgently needed repairs and updates to the water infrastructure system in Jackson.\nIn August 2022, Lumumba declared a water system emergency following the failure of the largest water treatment plant in Jackson. The crisis was caused by decades of mishandled and out-of-date water and waste infrastructure that led to at least 2,300 U.S. gallons (8,700 liters) of sewage overflowing into the Pearl River. Overflowing water from the Ross Barnett Reservoir and the Pearl River caused the water treatment plant in Jackson to completely fail. With the system down, many of the 153,000 residents of Jackson were left without clean drinking water, or with poor water pressure.\nOn January 6, 2023, Lumumba announced that they had secured the funding needed to begin repairing and reconstructing the water systems in Jackson. Nearly $800 million in funding was pulled from the $1.7 trillion federal omnibus bill that was passed back in late 2022. The EPA would work closely with the mayor and officials of Jackson to handle the funding and project.\n\n\n=== National politics ===\nIn February 2020, Lumumba endorsed Bernie Sanders in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.

The city covers 100.4 square miles (260.035 km2) and had an estimated population of 294,757 in 2023. It is the state's second-most populous city and the 71st-largest in the United States. Lincoln is the economic and cultural anchor of the Lincoln Metropolitan and Lincoln-Beatrice Combined Statistical Areas, home to 361,921 people.\nLincoln was founded in 1856 as the village of Lancaster on the wild salt marshes and arroyos of what became Lancaster County. Renamed after President Abraham Lincoln, it became Nebraska's state capital in 1869. The Bertram G. Goodhue–designed state capitol building was completed in 1932, and is the nation's second-tallest capitol. As the city is the seat of government for the state of Nebraska, the state and the U.S. government are major employers. The University of Nebraska was founded in Lincoln in 1869. The university is Nebraska's largest, with 26,079 students enrolled, and the city's third-largest employer. Other primary employers fall into the service and manufacturing industries, including a growing high-tech sector. The region makes up a part of what is known as the Midwest Silicon Prairie.\nDesignated as a \"refugee-friendly\" city by the U.S. Department of State in the 1970s, the city was the 12th-largest resettlement site per capita in the country by 2000. Refugee Vietnamese, Karen (Burmese ethnic minority), Sudanese and Yazidi (Iraqi ethnic minority) people, as well as refugees from Iraq, the Middle East and Afghanistan, have resettled in the city. During the 2018–19 school year, Lincoln Public Schools provided support for about 3,000 students from 150 countries, who spoke 125 different languages.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Natives ===\nBefore the expansion westward of settlers, the prairie was covered with buffalo grass. Plains Indians, descendants of indigenous peoples who occupied the area for thousands of years, lived in and hunted along Salt Creek. The Pawnee, which included four tribes, lived in villages along the Platte River. The Great Sioux Nation, including the Ihanktowan-Ihanktowana and the Lakota, to the north and west, used Nebraska as a hunting and skirmish ground, but did not have any long-term settlements in the state. An occasional buffalo could still be seen in the plat of Lincoln in the 1860s.\n\n\n=== Founding ===\n\nLincoln was founded in 1856 as the village of Lancaster and became the county seat of the newly created Lancaster County in 1859. The village was sited on the east bank of Salt Creek. The first settlers were attracted to the area due to the abundance of salt. Once J. Sterling Morton developed his salt mines in Kansas, salt in the village was no longer a viable commodity. Captain W. T. Donovan, a former steamer captain, and his family settled on Salt Creek in 1856. In 1859, the village settlers met to form a county. A caucus was formed and the committee, which included Donovan, selected Lancaster as the county seat. The county was named Lancaster. After the passage of the 1862 Homestead Act, homesteaders began to inhabit the area. The first plat was dated August 6, 1864.\nBy the end of 1868, Lancaster had a population of approximately 500. The township of Lancaster was renamed Lincoln, with the incorporation of the city of Lincoln on April 1, 1869. In 1869, the University of Nebraska was established in Lincoln by the state with a land grant of about 130,000 acres. Construction of University Hall, the first building, began the same year.\n\n\n=== State capital ===\n\nNebraska was granted statehood on March 1, 1867. The capital of the Nebraska Territory had been Omaha since the creation of the territory in 1854. Most of its population lived south of the Platte River. After much of the territory south of the Platte was considered annexation to Kansas, the territorial legislature voted to place the capital south of the river and as far west as possible.

He dropped out of the mayoral race in August 2014 and endorsed Jorge Elorza, the eventual winner. Elorza named Smiley the city's chief operating officer after the election. In September 2016, he became the chief of staff to Governor Gina Raimondo. In December 2019, Raimondo named Smiley as the new head of the Rhode Island Department of Administration. He resigned in February 2021.\n\n\n== Mayor of Providence ==\nAfter his resignation, Smiley announced his candidacy for mayor of Providence in the 2022 election, seeking to succeed Jorge Elorza, who was prevented from running for a third term due to term limits. He won the Democratic primary in September 2022 with 42% of the vote, while Gonzalo Cuervo received 36% and Nirva LaFortune earned 22%. He faced no opposition in the November 8 general election and took the oath of office on January 2, 2023.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSmiley's husband, Jim DeRentis, is a real estate agent.\n\n\n== References ==\nLauren Stein McLean (born October 20, 1974) is an American politician and entrepreneur serving as the mayor of Boise, Idaho. McLean served as a member of the Boise City Council from 2011 to 2019, and as council president from 2017 to 2019, before defeating four term incumbent Mayor Dave Bieter in the 2019 mayoral election.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMcLean was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and raised in Houston, Texas, and Cazenovia, New York. McLean received her Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Notre Dame in 1997 and a Master of Public Administration in environmental policy from Boise State University in 2001.\n\n\n== Personal Life ==\nMcLean and her husband Scott have two children.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMcLean serves on the board of governors of the Andrus Center for Public Policy at Boise State University. She is also a member of the Boise City Planning and Zoning Association and Boise Parks Commission.\n\n\n=== Mayor ===\n\n\n==== 2019 election ====\nMcLean was a candidate in the 2019 Boise mayoral election, running against incumbent Dave Bieter, former mayor H. Brent Coles, and others. Since neither Bieter nor McLean had surpassed the 50 percent vote threshold required to claim victory, the two competed in a runoff election held on December 3, 2019. McLean won with 65.5 percent of the vote to Bieter's 34.5 percent. The mayor's office is a nonpartisan position, though McLean is a registered Democrat.\nMcLean is the first woman elected to the office, and the second to serve as Boise mayor after Carolyn Terteling-Payne, who served briefly on an interim basis from 2003 to 2004. McLean was inaugurated on January 7, 2020.\n\n\n==== Tenure ====\nOn July 1, 2020, McLean presided over the swearing-in of Boise's new police chief, Ryan Lee, who had been confirmed to the position by the Boise City Council. The ceremony took place the day following a Boise Black Lives Matter rally. McLean does not support defunding the police to divert funds to social services. In response to a question about her position, she stated that \"We have to have a safe city if we’re going to have a city where everyone can thrive. I’m in full support of our police department.\" McLean has stated that she supports increasing funding for social services while maintaining funding for the police department.\nMcLean announced in March 2020 that April rents in city-owned public housing would be forgiven, and that during the same period the city would place a moratorium on evictions from public rental housing.\nIn November 2020, in response to rising numbers of COVID-19 cases and occupied hospital beds, McLean issued a mask mandate and closed public facilities. In response to the mask mandate, there were protests outside McLean's residence, in addition to a mask-burning ceremony. The city of Boise announced in January 2021 that public facilities would expand services beginning on February 1, 2021. McLean noted that \"We have seen a steady hold in cases the last couple weeks and our city is here to serve the public.\"\nMcLean announced Idaho's votes in the roll call at the 2020 Democratic National Convention where she also promoted the city's efforts to combat global warming. Due to Idaho's rising population, McLean has worked with city developers to build affordable housing.\n\n\n==== 2023 election ====\nMcLean was the incumbent candidate. Former police chief Mike Masterson ran in 2023 along with Joe Evans who received 0.9 percent of the vote and Aaron Reis who received 0.3 percent of the vote. McLean won with 55.4 percent of the vote, and Masterson with 43%.  This election year had 43.8 percent turnout of registered Boise voters.  The voter turnout was higher than in previous years.\n\n\n== Electoral history ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of mayors of Boise, Idaho\n\n\n== References ==\nMichael Christopher Johnston (born November 17, 1974) is an American educator and politician serving as the 46th and current mayor of Denver, Colorado. A member of the Democratic Party, he won the 2023 Denver mayoral election, defeating Kelly Brough in the June 6 runoff election.\nJohnston first entered politics when he served in the Colorado Senate, representing the 33rd district from 2009 to 2017. He was a candidate for governor of Colorado in 2018, losing in the primary to Jared Polis, who went on to win the general election. He was also a candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2020, before withdrawing from the race in September 2019.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nOne of four children, Johnston was born in Oklahoma City and raised in Vail, Colorado, the son of Sarah \"Sally\" (née Cox) and Paul Ross Johnston. His father was a U.S. Army veteran and businessman who served on the town council for more than a decade and then as mayor from 1983 to 1987.\nAfter graduating from Vail Mountain School in 1993, Johnston attended Yale College, earning his bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1997. During high school and college, he was involved in community service activities, including volunteering at a Denver homeless shelter and mentoring youth in a New Haven housing project. After graduating from college, he taught English at Greenville High School in rural Mississippi for two years as part of the Teach For America program. Based on this experience, he wrote the book In the Deep Heart's Core.\nAfter his program ended, Johnston enrolled in the Harvard Graduate School of Education, earning a master's degree in education policy. While at Harvard, he worked with Al Gore's education advisor, Jon Schnur. With Schnur and others, he helped to found New Leaders for New Schools, an organization dedicated to training and recruiting leaders for urban schools. Upon earning his master's degree, he enrolled in Yale Law School, and became an education policy advisor to political candidates, including U.S. Senate candidate Tom Strickland in 2002.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nAfter returning to Colorado in 2003, he was hired as principal at Joan Farley Academy. In 2004, he served as principal of the Marvin Foote Detention Center, which houses students in detention centers held in state custody, and organized the first high school graduation in the center's history. In 2005, Johnston taught education law at the University of Denver Law School and became the founding principal of Mapleton Expeditionary School of the Arts (MESA), a public school in Thornton, Colorado. As the school's principal, he helped to develop the school's curriculum and program as the school district shifted to developing smaller schools.\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Johnston helped lead an education summit in New Orleans and worked with U.S. Congressman George Miller on legislation to recruit and retain teachers. He joined Senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign as an informal advisor early in 2007; by May 2008, he was regarded as one of the campaign's key advisors on education issues. Obama delivered a major address on education from MESA in May 2008.  The school's achievements were highlighted in an October 2008 campaign advertisement.\nJohnston has served on the boards of local and national education and service organizations, including the I Have A Dream Foundation, the Urban League, City Year, New Leaders, America Achieves, and America Succeeds. In 2010, he was featured in Forbes magazine's \"7 Most Powerful Educators\" and Time magazine's \"40 Under 40\".\nJohnston served as the chief executive officer of Gary Community Ventures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under his leadership, the nonprofit organization delivered almost two million test kits and helped coordinate thousands of vaccinations across Colorado.\n\n\n== Early political career ==\n\n\n=== Colorado Senate ===\n\n\n==== Elections ====\nIn April 2009, Johnston declared his candidacy for Colorado's 33rd Senate district, a hist\nMary-Ann Baldwin is an American marketing executive and politician from the state of North Carolina. A member of the Democratic Party, she is the mayor of Raleigh, North Carolina, serving since 2019, and previously served on the Raleigh City Council from 2007 to 2017.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBaldwin grew up in Rhode Island and graduated from the University of Rhode Island. She is married to Jim Baldwin and she has two children, a daughter and son-in-law.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Baldwin communications ===\nPrior to political service, she worked in the marketing field, including working as marketing director for several firms and managing her own consulting firm, Baldwin Communications.\n\n\n=== City council service ===\n\nShe served on the Raleigh City Council for ten years, from 2007 through 2017 during the mayoral terms of Charles Meeker and Nancy McFarlane. While on the city council, she served as chair of the Law & Public Safety Committee and the Transportation Committee, and served on several other committees, as well as acting as the city's representative to GoTriangle, a regional transportation authority.  When Meeker decided to step down prior to the 2011 election, he approached both Baldwin and McFarlane to run for mayor in his stead, Baldwin however declined the offer to run, as she was dealing with personal issues, she felt would interfere with her ability to effectively campaign and serve in the role as mayor.\n\n\n=== Mayoral tenure ===\nOn March 27, 2019, Baldwin announced that she would be running for mayor of Raleigh in the 2019 election to succeed McFarlane, who was stepping down as mayor in the midst of health troubles. Baldwin came in first place, winning 38% of the vote. A runoff was not requested by Charles Francis, the runner-up, and so Baldwin became mayor of Raleigh. She assumed office December 2, 2019. Baldwin ran for reelection in 2022, defeating DaQuanta Copeland and Terrance Ruth. On April 16, 2024, Baldwin announced that she would not seek reelection.\n\n\n==== Response to COVID-19 ====\nBaldwin was mayor while the COVID-19 pandemic impacted Raleigh. On June 17, 2020, she made a proclamation that mandated masks. Baldwin made a second mask mandate on August 13, 2021, due to the rise in the Delta variant that she later terminated on February 18, 2022. Mayor Baldwin tested positive for COVID-19 on April 18, 2022.\n\n\n==== Response to George Floyd Protests ====\nBaldwin was mayor during the George Floyd protests in Raleigh. In the midst of rioting she declared a citywide curfew. Her response was criticized in the following weeks.\n\n\n==== Tax Increment Grant (TIG) and Property Tax Increase ====\nOn May 4, 2021, Raleigh City Council approved a tax increment grant (TIG) policy which Mayor Baldwin voted in favor of. Mayor Baldwin received campaign contributions from developer John Kane, who may benefit from the TIG. The TIG policy allows the city of Raleigh to provide up to $5 million per year (2% of the annual budget) in tax rebates to private developers, effectively shielding them from increases in property taxes due to rising property values. A month later on June 1, 2021, Raleigh City Council passed an annual budget that included an increase in property taxes generating an increased $7 million per year which was supported by Mayor Baldwin.\n\n\n==== Gun violence ====\nBaldwin responded after the 2022 Raleigh shootings killed five people, including a law enforcement employee.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mayors of the 50 largest cities in the United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nProfile at Vote Smart\nBio page City of Raleigh website.\nFrank D. Scott Jr. (born November 18, 1983) is an American politician from the state of Arkansas. He is the mayor of Little Rock, Arkansas, serving since January 2019. Scott is a member of the Democratic Party.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nScott is from Southwest Little Rock. He graduated from Parkview Arts and Science Magnet High School. He then earned his bachelor's degree in business from the University of Memphis, where he became a brother of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, and his Master of Business Administration from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nScott began his public service career in the office of Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe, where he served for five years, first as deputy policy director and later as director of intergovernmental affairs. Scott accepted a position as a community banker with First Security Bank, while continuing to devote significant time to serving both his city and state as a member of the Port of Little Rock Board of Directors and as a member of the Arkansas Highway Commission.\nIn the 2018 election, Scott ran for mayor of Little Rock. In the November 6 nonpartisan election, he led a five-candidate field with 37.11% of the vote, falling short of the 40% required to avoid a runoff election. Scott and Baker Kurrus advanced to a December 4 runoff, where Scott defeated Kurrus. Scott is the first elected African American mayor of Little Rock.\nScott was sworn in on January 1, 2019. In his first term, Scott proposed the \"Rebuild the Rock\" initiative, to be supported by a new sales tax to replace an expiring one. The initiative is meant to fund improvement of infrastructure and public parks, a senior center, sports complex, and upgrade technology and equipment used by first responders. The measure was defeated in a referendum in September 2021. Scott continues to push for a new sales tax and a date for a new referendum has been set for November 2024.\nScott ran for reelection in the 2022 election. He defeated local businessman Steve Landers, Sr, with 50% of the vote.\nOn April 21, 2023, the Arkansas Ethics Commission voted 4-1 that Scott was in violation of the law for not reimbursing the city when he used his city-owned vehicle to travel to and from campaign events in his 2022 re-election campaign. Scott paid a $250 fine.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nProfile at Vote Smart",

The 2023 overperformances consisted of unusually larger margins of victory in races held in safely Democratic areas and unusually smaller margins of defeat in races held in safely Republican areas. The results indicate a suburban shift among affluent, college-educated voters that started as an underlying reaction to Donald Trump's election in 2016.

Many conservative political analysts and commentators called a continued Republican alliance with the anti-abortion movement \"untenable\" and an \"electoral disaster\", and urged the party to favor abortion rights. Young voters in particular gave overwhelming support for abortion rights. Among voters between 18 and 29 years old in increasingly Republican Ohio, an estimated 77% voted for Ohio Issue 1, including a majority of Republicans.
