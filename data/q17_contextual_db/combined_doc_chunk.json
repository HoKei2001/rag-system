        "content": "Lincoln is the capital of the U.S. state of Nebraska and the county seat of Lancaster County. The city covers 100.4 square miles (260.035 km2) and had an estimated population of 294,757 in 2023. It is the state's second-most populous city and the 71st-largest in the United States. Lincoln is the economic and cultural anchor of the Lincoln Metropolitan and Lincoln-Beatrice Combined Statistical Areas, home to 361,921 people.\nLincoln was founded in 1856 as the village of Lancaster on the wild salt marshes and arroyos of what became Lancaster County. Renamed after President Abraham Lincoln, it became Nebraska's state capital in 1869. The Bertram G. Goodhue–designed state capitol building was completed in 1932, and is the nation's second-tallest capitol. As the city is the seat of government for the state of Nebraska, the state and the U.S. government are major employers. The University of Nebraska was founded in Lincoln in 1869. The university is Nebraska's largest, with 26,079 students enrolled, and the city's third-largest employer. Other primary employers fall into the service and manufacturing industries, including a growing high-tech sector. The region makes up a part of what is known as the Midwest Silicon Prairie.\nDesignated as a \"refugee-friendly\" city by the U.S. Department of State in the 1970s, the city was the 12th-largest resettlement site per capita in the country by 2000. Refugee Vietnamese, Karen (Burmese ethnic minority), Sudanese and Yazidi (Iraqi ethnic minority) people, as well as refugees from Iraq, the Middle East and Afghanistan, have resettled in the city. During the 2018–19 school year, Lincoln Public Schools provided support for about 3,000 students from 150 countries, who spoke 125 different languages.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Natives ===\nBefore the expansion westward of settlers, the prairie was covered with buffalo grass. Plains Indians, descendants of indigenous peoples who occupied the area for thousands of years, lived in and hunted along Salt Creek. The Pawnee, which included four tribes, lived in villages along the Platte River. The Great Sioux Nation, including the Ihanktowan-Ihanktowana and the Lakota, to the north and west, used Nebraska as a hunting and skirmish ground, but did not have any long-term settlements in the state. An occasional buffalo could still be seen in the plat of Lincoln in the 1860s.\n\n\n=== Founding ===\n\nLincoln was founded in 1856 as the village of Lancaster and became the county seat of the newly created Lancaster County in 1859. The village was sited on the east bank of Salt Creek. The first settlers were attracted to the area due to the abundance of salt. Once J. Sterling Morton developed his salt mines in Kansas, salt in the village was no longer a viable commodity. Captain W. T. Donovan, a former steamer captain, and his family settled on Salt Creek in 1856. In 1859, the village settlers met to form a county. A caucus was formed and the committee, which included Donovan, selected Lancaster as the county seat. The county was named Lancaster. After the passage of the 1862 Homestead Act, homesteaders began to inhabit the area. The first plat was dated August 6, 1864.\nBy the end of 1868, Lancaster had a population of approximately 500. The township of Lancaster was renamed Lincoln, with the incorporation of the city of Lincoln on April 1, 1869. In 1869, the University of Nebraska was established in Lincoln by the state with a land grant of about 130,000 acres. Construction of University Hall, the first building, began the same year.\n\n\n=== State capital ===\n\nNebraska was granted statehood on March 1, 1867. The capital of the Nebraska Territory had been Omaha since the creation of the territory in 1854. Most of its population lived south of the Platte River. After much of the territory south of the Platte was considered annexation to Kansas, the territorial legislature voted to place the capital south of the river and as far west as possible. Before the vote to remove the capit\nThe University of Nebraska–Lincoln (Nebraska, NU, or UNL) is a public land-grant research university in Lincoln, Nebraska, United States. Chartered in 1869 by the Nebraska Legislature as part of the Morrill Act of 1862, the school was the University of Nebraska until 1968, when it absorbed the Municipal University of Omaha to form the University of Nebraska system. It is the state's oldest university and the flagship institution of the state-wide system. The university has been governed by the Board of Regents since 1871, whose members are elected by district to six-year terms.\nThe university is organized into nine colleges: Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources, Architecture, Arts and Sciences, Business, Education and Human Sciences, Engineering, Fine and Performing Arts, Journalism and Mass Communications, and Law. NU offers over two hundred degrees across its undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral programs. The school also offers programs through the University of Nebraska Omaha College of Public Affairs and Community Service, the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Dentistry and College of Nursing, and the Peter Kiewit Institute, which is managed in partnership with the Kiewit Corporation.\nNebraska is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\". According to the National Science Foundation, Nebraska spent $320 million on research and development in 2020. Between its three campus locations (City Campus, East Campus, and Nebraska Innovation Campus) the university has over one hundred classroom buildings and research facilities. The university's enrollment in 2021 was 19,552 undergraduate students and 4,879 graduate students, with 1,595 full-time or part-time instructional faculty. Undergraduate admission to the school is considered \"more selective.\"\nNebraska's athletic programs, known as the Cornhuskers, compete in NCAA Division I and are a member of the Big Ten Conference. NU's football team has won forty-six conference championships and claims five national championships, with an additional nine unclaimed. Twenty-five former Cornhuskers have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. A total of 111 former Nebraska student-athletes have combined to win fifty-four Olympic medals, including sixteen gold medals. Among approximately 300,000 Nebraska alumni are three Nobel laureates, four Pulitzer Prize winners, one Turing Award winner, and twenty-two Rhodes Scholars.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Rise to Western prominence ===\nThe University of Nebraska was created by an act of the Nebraska Legislature in 1869, two years after Nebraska was admitted into the Union as the thirty-seventh state. The law described the new university's aims: \"The object of such institution shall be to afford to the inhabitants of the state the means of acquiring a thorough knowledge of the various branches of literature, science, and the arts.\" The school received an initial federal land grant of about 130,000 acres (53,000 ha) through the Morrill Act of 1862. Public opinion on the new school was split; many argued the state did not need a university as it did not even have a state-wide high school system, and others suggested any public university should be church-controlled, which was typical of eastern colleges at the time.\n\nCampus construction began in September 1869 when the cornerstone of University Hall was laid at the corner of 11th and S Streets. Though the building was very large, expensive, and ornate, it was made of low-quality materials and required a foundation repair before hosting a single class. By 1871, the university welcomed its inaugural class of twenty collegiate students and 110 preparatory students, and in 1873 offered its first degrees to graduating students. A school newspaper, Monthly Hesperian Student (later The Hesperian, now The Daily Nebraskan), was quickly established and the University of Nebraska State Museum (now Morrill Hall) opened in University Hall. In its earl\nLincoln Airport (IATA: LNK, ICAO: KLNK, FAA LID: LNK; formerly Lincoln Municipal Airport) is a joint public/military airport five miles (8.0 km) northwest of downtown Lincoln, the state capital, in Lancaster County, Nebraska, United States. It is owned by the Lincoln Airport Authority and is the second-largest airport in Nebraska. It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2023–2027 in which it is categorized as a non-hub primary commercial service facility. It has four gates with jetways, to be, as of February 2022, expanded to six.\nThe 12,901-foot (3,932 m) primary runway was a designated emergency landing site for the Space Shuttle, although it was never used as such. The runway can handle heavy military aircraft including the C-5 Galaxy and the Boeing E-4. The airport is also the home of Lincoln Air National Guard Base, an installation for the KC-135R Stratotanker aircraft operated by the 155th Air Refueling Wing (155 ARW) of the Nebraska Air National Guard. Airliners on charter flights by visiting college athletic teams which play the Nebraska Cornhuskers also utilize Lincoln Airport as a primary destination, although many football teams fly into Omaha's Eppley Airfield, since they lodge in Omaha the night before a game due to lack of available hotel space in Lincoln, then depart from Lincoln immediately after the game. The airport is home to Duncan Aviation, a family-owned aircraft maintenance and refurbishing company. Duncan Aviation has hangars on the east side of the airport and parts storage on the west side.\nLincoln Airport appeared in the 1983 movie Terms of Endearment,  the 2008 film Yes Man, and the 2013 animated film Planes.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nWhat would become Lincoln Airport began in the early 1920s when the city selected a plot of land Northwest of the city to be used as a municipal airport. Charles Lindbergh  learned to fly at Lincoln Airfield in 1922. The airfield became an air mail stop in 1928 and became a United Air Lines stop during 1927; United continues to serve Lincoln to this day through its regional partners.\nThe Lincoln Airplane and Flying School was established in 1928 and operated at the airfield (which briefly was known as Lindbergh Field), before later moving to Union Airport a few miles east.  In 1939, the Lincoln Airplane and Flying School was one of nine civilian contract flight schools contracted by the United States Army Air Corps as Lincoln Army Air Field for basic flight training of air cadets under the 4500 pilot training expansion program.  The school was operated by E. J. Sias.  However, due to the short summer flying season, flight training in Lincoln was closed on 15 November 1940 and moved to Drane Field in Lakeland, Florida where it reopened with new owners under the name \"Lakeland School of Aeronautics\" and continued Army contract pilot training.  As part of the contract flying school, the Air Corps established the 47th Training Detachment to command the military flight cadets at the school, which apparently also moved to Lakeland along with the school. The school/base closed in December 1945 and the airport was transferred back to the City of Lincoln.\nAlong with its civil use, Lincoln Airport became host to a flying unit of the newly formed Nebraska Air National Guard along with a Naval Reserve unit flying patrol aircraft. The 173rd Fighter Squadron became the host unit of what became known as Lincoln Air National Guard Base.  Equipped with P-51 Mustang fighters in 1946, it was the second Air National Guard unit established. A few years later, F-80C Shooting Star jet fighters would replace the unit's F-51s until the advent of the Korean War. The United States Navy Reserve also established Naval Air Station Lincoln (NAS Lincoln) on the airport, primarily as home to Patrol Squadron 762 (VP-762) and its P-2 Neptune aircraft.\nIn 1952, the United States Air Force took over the airport as Lincoln Air Force Base, complicat\nLincoln County is a county located in the U.S. state of Nebraska. As of the 2020 census, the population was 34,676. Its county seat is North Platte. Despite the county's name, the state capital city of Lincoln is not in or near Lincoln County. Lincoln County is one of the three counties in the North Platte Micropolitan Statistical Area. In the Nebraska license plate system, Lincoln County is represented by the prefix 15 (it had the fifteenth-largest number of vehicles registered for a state county when the license plate system was established in 1922).\n\n\n== Geography ==\nLincoln County is located in the Nebraska Sandhills, a region of mixed-grass prairie on grass-stabilized dunes. The land is generally given to agriculture, with considerable center pivot irrigation and cattle ranching. The North Platte River and the South Platte River flow eastward from Keith County, joining to form the Platte River east of the city of  North Platte in central Lincoln County.  The Platte then flows ESE out of the county. The county has a total area of 2,575 square miles (6,670 km2), of which 2,564 square miles (6,640 km2) is land and 11 square miles (28 km2) (0.4%) is water. It is the third-largest county in Nebraska by area.\nMost of Nebraska's 93 counties (the eastern 2/3, including Lincoln County) observe Central Time; the western counties observe Mountain Time. Lincoln County is the westernmost of the Nebraska counties to entirely observe Central Time.\n\n\n=== Major highways ===\n\n\n=== Transit ===\nBurlington Trailways\nExpress Arrow\n\n\n=== Adjacent counties ===\n\n\n=== Protected areas ===\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of the 2020 United States Census there were 34,674 people and 14,485 households in the county. The population density was 13.46 people per square mile (5.20 people/km2).  The racial makeup of the county was 94.6% White, 1.3% Black or African American, 1.3% Native American, 0.9% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, and 1.8% from two or more races. 10% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.\nAs of the 2000 United States Census there were 34,632 people, 14,076 households, and 9,444 families in the county. The population density was 14 people per square mile (5.4 people/km2). There are 15,438 housing units in Lincoln: 6 units per square mile (2.3/km2). The racial makeup of the county was 94.70% White, 0.54% Black or African American, 0.51% Native American, 0.37% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 2.65% from other races, and 1.21% from two or more races. 5.43% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.\nThere were 14,076 households, out of which 32.00% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 55.90% were married couples living together, 8.00% had a female householder with no husband present, and 32.90% were non-families. 28.30% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.60% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.41 and the average family size was 2.97.\nThe county population contained 26.20% under the age of 18, 8.30% from 18 to 24, 26.60% from 25 to 44, 23.80% from 45 to 64, and 15.10% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 96.50 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 93.40 males.\nThe median income for a household in the county was $36,568, and the median income for a family was $45,185. Males had a median income of $36,244 versus $20,252 for females. The per capita income for the county was $18,696. About 7.20% of families and 9.70% of the population were below the poverty line, including 12.10% of those under age 18 and 9.30% of those age 65 or over.\n\n\n== Communities ==\n\n\n=== City ===\nNorth Platte  (county seat)\n\n\n=== Villages ===\nBrady\nHershey\nMaxwell\nSutherland\nWallace\nWellfleet\n\n\n=== Unincorporated communities ===\n\n\n== Politics ==\nLincoln County voters generally vote Republican. In only three national elections since 1916 has the county selected the Democratic Party candidate,\nThe Nebraska State Capitol is the seat of government of the U.S. state of Nebraska and is located in downtown Lincoln. Designed by New York architect Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue in 1920, it was constructed of Indiana limestone from 1922 to 1932. The capitol houses the primary executive and judicial offices of Nebraska and is home to the Nebraska Legislature—the only unicameral state legislature in the United States.\nThe Nebraska State Capitol's 400-foot (120 m) tower can be seen twenty miles (32 km) away. It was the first state capitol to incorporate a functional tower into its design. Goodhue stated that \"Nebraska is a level country and its capitol should have some altitude or beacon effect.\" In 1976, the National Park Service designated the capitol a National Historic Landmark, and in 1997, the Park Service extended the designation to include the capitol grounds, which Ernst H. Herminghaus designed in 1932.\n\n\n== Dimensions and features ==\n\nThe structure is anchored by a three-story, 437-foot (133 m) square base. This square base houses offices most frequently visited by the public. The second floor (main floor) is home to the office of the Governor of Nebraska, the Nebraska Supreme Court, the Nebraska Court of Appeals, and the Nebraska Legislature.\nFrom the center of the base, a tower rises 362 feet (110 m), crowned by a gold-tiled dome. The finial—The Sower and its pedestal—add an additional 32 feet (9.8 m) to the building's height. Common measurements list the capitol at 400 feet (120 m), making it the second-tallest U.S. statehouse, surpassed only by the 450-foot (140 m) Louisiana State Capitol (then-Governor of Louisiana Huey Pierce Long insisted the new Louisiana capitol be built taller than Nebraska's.).\nGoodhue originally envisioned much of the tower to house the collections of the Nebraska State Library, and he planned for each of the 17-foot (5.2 m) tower floors to include glass-floored stacks for book storage. As early as November 1920, however, Goodhue indicated that the tower could serve any purpose, including office space. By September 1925, the Capitol Commission decided that the tower should be built for office space. Tower floors continue to house various offices today.\nIn total, there are 15 stories in the capitol (three mechanical levels also exist within the tower between the 3rd and 4th floors). Memorial Chamber on the 14th floor—the highest publicly accessible level—has four observation decks that offer views of Lincoln from 245 feet (75 m) above the ground.\nLincoln Municipal Code places height restrictions on structures within the designated Capitol Environs District. This code helps to maintain the capitol's title as the tallest building in Lincoln. The capitol held the title of tallest building in Nebraska until 1969 with the completion of the 478-foot (146 m) Woodmen Tower in downtown Omaha. With the completion of Omaha's 634-foot (193 m) First National Bank Tower in 2002, the capitol became the third-tallest building in Nebraska.\n\n\n== Capital cities, capitol buildings ==\n\nCongress officially opened Nebraska Territory with the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. Almost instantly a factional divide between North Platters (those living north of the Platte River) and South Platters (those living south of the Platte) arose over the question of capital location. Much to the chagrin of the South Platters, Acting Governor Thomas B. Cuming selected the small northern village of Omaha City for the seat of government. Cuming was from Iowa, and as his political allies were investors in the Council Bluffs and Nebraska Ferry Company, Omaha as capital would be beneficial to his personal political career. \nResults from the first territorial census, however, revealed 914 North Platters and 1,818 South Platters. The South Platters, with greater legislative representation, would be able to take the capital, but Cuming ignored proportional representation and assigned seven councilmen and fourteen representatives \nLincoln High School is a public secondary school located in Lincoln, Nebraska, United States. A part of the Lincoln Public Schools school district, it is the largest high school in the city.  More than 40,000 students have graduated from Lincoln High in its 153-year history. The school colors are red and black, and the mascot is the Links. Its mascot is memorialized in a statue on the school's front lawn, gifted by the class of 1970, with four individual links chained together. These represent the hopeful characteristics of Lincoln High School: tradition, diversity, excellence, and unity.\n\n\n== History ==\nLincoln High School was founded in 1871 and is the oldest of six public high schools in the city of Lincoln. The present building was opened in 1915, with significant additions completed in 1927, 1957, 1985, and 1996. It is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools and has the AA accreditation rating of the Nebraska State Board of Education. In 1984 it was named a Recognized School of Excellence by the U.S. Department of Education. Lincoln High School began its formal participation in the International Baccalaureate Program in 2008 after a formal application process. It is one of only three high schools in Nebraska involved in the program. The others are Millard North High School and Omaha Central High School, both located in Omaha.\nIn 2018, Lincoln High School was honored as a \"School of Opportunity\" by the National Education Policy Center, at the University of Colorado Boulder, for its commitment to multicultural educational support and academic rigor. It was one of only eight public schools awarded this honor with the \"Gold\" designation, the highest designation for this honor. Principal Mark Larson states, \"This recognition also speaks to the unique culture that has been in place at Lincoln High for many years and hopefully will continue for years to come.\"\nWhile teaching at Lincoln High School, four Lincoln High faculty have been honored as Nebraska Teacher of the Year, including John Heineman (2000), Patsy Koch Johns (2006), Amber Vlasnik (2017), and Sydney Jensen (2019).\nAfter the Lincoln Public Schools administration building burned in 2011, the Lincoln High Library Media Center staff realized the importance of digitizing the archives of Lincoln High School. The school newspaper, The Advocate, is available digitally.\n\n\n== Student body and academic programs ==\nThe student body is 46% White, 11% African-American, 10% Asian-American, 21% Hispanic/Latino, and 2% Native American, Native Hawaiian, or Alaska Native. 9% of students are of two or more races. LHS has approximately 330 students in ELL (English Language Learner) classes. Over 60% of its student body is in the Free or Reduced Price Lunch Program, and 17% are identified as either gifted or highly gifted. Over 30 different languages are spoken as first languages to students. The largest group speak Spanish (56), and the next four largest groups speak Arabic, Kurdish, Vietnamese, and Karen. Other languages spoken are Russian, Ukrainian, Nuer (Sudan), Bosnian, Pashtu, Dinka, Cambodian, Filipino, Chinese, and Burmese.\nLincoln High School offers hundreds of courses in twelve different departments to its over 2,000 students, operating on a seven-period day schedule. It has 150 certified staff members and 90 support staff members.\n\n\n== Athletics ==\nLincoln High School competes as a NSAA District 1 school in the Heartland Athletic Conference.\n\n\n=== Baseball ===\nLincoln High School's baseball program is headed by Coach Jon Beiermann, JV Nathan Gumb, Reserve Thomas Riley, and 9th Chase Martin.

It borders South Dakota to the north; Iowa to the east and Missouri to the southeast, both across the Missouri River; Kansas to the south; Colorado to the southwest; and Wyoming to the west. Nebraska is the 16th-largest state by land area, with just over 77,220 square miles (200,000 km2). With a population of over 1.9 million, it is the 38th-most populous state and the eighth-least densely populated. Its capital is Lincoln, and its most populous city is Omaha, which is on the Missouri River. Nebraska was admitted into the United States in 1867, two years after the end of the American Civil War. The Nebraska Legislature is unlike any other American legislature in that it is unicameral, and its members are elected without any official reference to political party affiliation. Nebraska is one of only two states that divide electoral college votes by district, and is not winner-take-all.\nNebraska is composed of two major land regions: the Dissected Till Plains and the Great Plains. The Dissected Till Plains region consists of gently rolling hills and contains the state's largest cities, Omaha and Lincoln. The Great Plains region, occupying most of western Nebraska, is characterized by treeless prairie. Eastern Nebraska has a humid continental climate while western Nebraska is primarily semi-arid. The state has wide variations between winter and summer temperatures; the variations decrease in southern Nebraska. Violent thunderstorms and tornadoes occur primarily during spring and summer, and sometimes in autumn. The Chinook wind tends to warm the state significantly in the winter and early spring.\nIndigenous peoples, including Omaha, Missouria, Ponca, Pawnee, Otoe, and various branches of the Lakota (Sioux) tribes, lived in the region for thousands of years before European discovery and exploration. The state is crossed by many historic trails, including that of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The completion of the Transcontinental Railroad through Nebraska and passage of the Homestead Acts led to rapid growth in the population of American settlers in the 1870s and 1880s and the development of a large agriculture sector for which the state is known to this day.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nNebraska's name is the result of anglicization of the archaic Otoe Ñí Brásge (contemporary Otoe: Ñíbrahge; pronounced [ɲĩbɾasꜜkɛ]), or the Omaha Ní Btháska, (pronounced [nĩbɫᶞasꜜka]), meaning \"flat water\", after the Platte River which flows through the state.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nIndigenous peoples lived in the region of present-day Nebraska for thousands of years before European colonization. The historic tribes in the state included the Omaha, Missouria, Ponca, Pawnee, Otoe, and various branches of the Lakota (Sioux), some of which migrated from eastern areas into the region. When European exploration, trade, and settlement began, both Spain and France sought to control the region. In the 1690s, Spain established trade connections with the Apache, whose territory then included western Nebraska. By 1703, France had developed a regular trade with native peoples along the Missouri River in Nebraska, and by 1719 had signed treaties with several of these peoples. After war broke out between the two countries, Spain dispatched an armed expedition to Nebraska under Lieutenant General Pedro de Villasur in 1720. The party was attacked and destroyed near present-day Columbus by a large force of Pawnee and Otoe, both allied with the French. The massacre ended Spanish exploration of the area for the remainder of the 18th century.\nIn 1762, during the Seven Years' War, France ceded the Louisiana territory to Spain. This left Britain and Spain competing for dominance along the Mississippi River; by 1773, the British were trading with the native peoples of Nebraska. Spain dispatched two trading expeditions up the Missouri River in 1794 and 1795; the second, un\nMemorial Stadium, nicknamed The Sea of Red, is an American football stadium located on the campus of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in Lincoln, Nebraska. The stadium primarily serves as the home venue for the Nebraska Cornhuskers of the Big Ten Conference.\nMemorial Stadium was built in 1923 at a cost of $450,000 and a capacity of 31,080 to replace Nebraska Field, where the Cornhuskers played home games from 1909 to 1922. The first game at the new stadium was a 24–0 victory over Oklahoma on October 13, 1923. A series of expansions raised the stadium's capacity to 85,458, but attendance numbers have in the past exceeded 90,000. Nebraska has sold out an NCAA-record 402 consecutive games at Memorial Stadium, a streak that dates back to 1962.\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\nIn 1909, the University of Nebraska constructed Nebraska Field on the corner of North 10th Street and T Street in downtown Lincoln, the school's first football-only stadium. However, its wooden construction and limited seating capacity meant that after less than ten years there was significant momentum toward the building of a larger steel-and-concrete stadium for the Cornhuskers. The abrupt departure of highly successful head coach Ewald O. Stiehm temporarily slowed this momentum, but by the early 1920s, with \"the present athletic field as inadequate now as the old one was in 1907,\" the university began plans to build a new stadium on the site of Nebraska Field.\nThe new stadium project was initially conceived as a combination gymnasium-stadium-war museum complex to be called the \"Nebraska Soldiers and Sailors Memorial.\" Enthusiasm for the fundraising effort was high following the death of former Nebraska football captain Dusty Rhodes, who was killed in action in France during World War I. Due to a slow post-war economy, the scope of the project was decreased to just a football stadium (though the Nebraska Coliseum was ultimately completed next door to Memorial Stadium just three years later). John Latenser Sr. of Omaha and Ellery L. Davis of Lincoln were selected as the head architects for the new stadium as they were willing to work pro bono. When the fundraising target amount of $450,000 had been met, construction began and a groundbreaking ceremony was held on April 23, 1923. Construction was completed on the 31,000-seat stadium in just over ninety days, in time for NU's first home game of the 1923 season, a 24–0 win over Oklahoma on October 13. Memorial Stadium was dedicated the following week to honor Nebraskans who served in the American Civil War and the Spanish–American War, and the 751 Nebraskans who died in World War I. Later, the dedication was expanded to honor Nebraskans who died in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War.\nEach corner of the stadium was given an inscription from philosophy professor Hartley Burr Alexander:\n\nSoutheast: \"In Commemoration of the men of Nebraska who served and fell in the Nation's Wars.\"\nSouthwest: \"Not the victory but the action; Not the goal but the game; In the deed the glory.\"\nNorthwest: \"Courage; Generosity; Fairness; Honor; In these are the true awards of manly sport.\"\nNortheast: \"Their Lives they held their country's trust; They kept its faith; They died its heroes.\"\nThe playing field is aligned north-south at an approximate elevation of 1,150 feet (350 m) above sea level. In its original layout, the stadium had open end zones and grandstands on the east and west sides of the field with a seating capacity of 31,080. A quarter-mile track surrounded the playing field for use by the school's track and field program.\n\n\n== Expansion ==\nMemorial Stadium remained largely unchanged for over a decade after its 1923 opening, and by the mid-1930s the university began planning to build extra football facilities along the stadium's north end zone.

The county of Lancaster was founded in 1859.  Prior to settlement from the westward expansion of the United States, Plains Indians, descendants of indigenous peoples who occupied the area for thousands of years lived in and hunted along Salt Creek.  Settlers first came to extract salt from the wild salt flats of Salt Creek.  Nebraska was granted statehood March 1, 1867.  Soon afterwards a commission created by the State was appointed to locate the State Capital on State lands.  The village of Lancaster was chosen for the Capital of Nebraska.  The village of Lancaster became Lincoln.  Lincoln was named after Abraham Lincoln.  The first State Capitol was completed in 1868.  Lincoln incorporated on April 1, 1869.\nBy 1870, railroads began to use Lincoln as a stop westward, and by 1892, Lincoln was a rail center.  In the early twentieth century, Volga-German immigrants from Russia began settling in the North Bottoms neighborhood.  By 1911, the Omaha-Lincoln-Denver Highway (O-L-D) established through Lincoln. By 1920 the first air field Union Airport was established northeast of Lincoln.  As transportation linked Lincoln to points east, west, north and south, the cities population grew to 54,948 by 1920.\nThe suburban Gateway Mall was completed in 1960.  The downtown core began to deteriorate as businesses moved to suburban areas. Revitalization began in 1969 after the passage of State laws for revitalization and beautification of blighted urban areas.  Lincoln's first woman mayor, Helen Boosalis, was elected in 1975.  Mayor Boosalis was a strong supporter of revitalization and for making Lincoln a home for refugees beginning with the Vietnamese relocation program in the late 1970s.  Lincoln was designated as a \"Refugee Friendly\" city by the U.S. Department of State in 1990.  Lincoln's population grew to 258,379 by 2010.\n\n\n== 19th century ==\n\n\n=== Pioneer Lincoln ===\n\nPrior to the expansion westward of settlers, the prairie was covered with buffalo grass.  From 1847 to 1860, the cattle of the west-bound ox trains spread seed that they had eaten along the trails in their journey westward, introducing new plant species to the prairie.  Plains Indians, descendants of indigenous peoples who occupied the area for thousands of years, lived in and hunted along Salt Creek.  The Pawnee, which included four tribes, lived in villages along the Platte River.  The Great Sioux Nation, including the Ihanktowan-Ihanktowana and the Lakota located to the north and west, used Nebraska as a hunting and skirmish ground, although they did not have any long-term settlements in the state.  An occasional buffalo could still be seen in the plat of Lincoln in the 1860s.\n\n\n=== Founding ===\nLincoln was founded in 1856 as the village of Lancaster and became the county seat of the newly created Lancaster County in 1859.  The village was sited on the east bank of Salt Creek.  The first settlers were attracted to the area due to the abundance of salt.  Salt was a commodity used primarily in the preservation of meat.  Greater quantities of salt could be obtained by boiling away the water in vats. Once J. Sterling Morton developed his salt mines in Kansas, salt in the village was no longer a viable commodity.\nCaptain W. T. Donovan, a former steamer captain, and his family settled on Salt Creek in 1856.  The Captain was selected to represent the Crescent Company in the production of salt.  Other settlers began to settle in the area.  During the latter part of 1858, Captain Donovan and his family abandoned the schemes of the Crescent Company and left the area to the Stevens Creek settlement due to the threatening aspect of the Pawnee Indians.\nIn the fall of 1859, the village settlers met to form a county.  A caucus was formed and the committee, which included Captain Donovan from Stevens Creek, selected the village of Lancaster to be the county seat.  The county was named La\nThe Lincoln Journal Star is an American daily newspaper that serves Lincoln, Nebraska, the state capital and home of the University of Nebraska. It is the most widely read newspaper in Lincoln and has the second-largest circulation in Nebraska (after the Omaha World-Herald). The paper also operates a commercial printing unit.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Lincoln Journal Star is the result of a 1995 merger between the city's two historic newspapers. The Lincoln Star, established in 1905, was Lincoln's morning newspaper while the Lincoln Journal was distributed in the evenings. The Journal was itself the conglomeration of several previous Lincoln newspapers.\n\n\n=== The Lincoln Journal ===\n\nOn September 7, 1867, Charles Henry Gere founded the Nebraska Commonwealth. A member of the prominent Gere family, Gere was a New York native and Civil War veteran. As an attorney who had studied law in Baltimore, Gere quickly became an important figure in Nebraska, serving as the private secretary of the state's first governor. Gere spearheaded numerous local issues, specifically favoring the idea that all state government functions should be housed in one city as opposed to scattering them across the state. As such, Gere became an important voice in the nascent state capital, Lincoln, and the Nebraska Commonwealth became its first newspaper.\nIn 1869, two years after moving the Commonwealth to Lincoln, Gere changed the name of the publication to the  Nebraska State Journal. The following year, the newspaper became a daily. As his publication grew, Gere retired from law to become an active part of his newspaper. Having served in the first governor's administration, the state constitutional convention, the state senate, the education commission, the committee on railroads, and the University of Nebraska Board of Regents, Gere's long history of involvement in local politics and strongly-held views impacted the editorial tone of the paper. In one editorial in 1890, Gere famously likened the Farmer's Alliance and its candidates to \"a herd of hogs\", criticizing the party for disrupting Republican party politics in the state.\nIn 1897, J.C. Seacrest, a former reporter for the Nebraska State Journal, purchased the Lincoln Evening News, which was published by the State Journal as an evening edition. By 1922, Seacrest had changed the name of the Lincoln Evening News to the Lincoln Evening Journal and become the majority owner of the State Journal Company. Seacrest merged the two publications to create the Lincoln Evening Journal & Nebraska State Journal.\n\n\n=== The Lincoln Star ===\nIn 1902, Lincoln utilities tycoon and millionaire D.E. Thompson established the Lincoln Daily Star. In 1910, Thompson sold the Daily Star to local grain operator Herbert E. Gooch. The Great Depression caused Gooch to sell the publication to the Lee Group of Davenport, Iowa, now Lee Enterprises, for one million dollars in 1930. As the Depression wore on, financial circumstances forced the Seacrests and Lee Group to buy minority interest in each other's companies in 1931 to stay afloat. However, the two publications remained independent and controlled their own content.\n\n\n=== Merger ===\nThe two papers had held minority stakes in each other since 1931. In 1937, J.C. Seacrest created a trust which ensured that the Journal would remain in the possession of the Seacrest family throughout the lifetimes of his sons, Joe W. and Fred S. Seacrest, and their children. Joe W. and Fred inherited the Journal upon their father's death in 1942.\nHowever, financial realities forced greater cooperation between the Journal and Star and in 1950, the State Journal Printing Company and Star Printing Company merged into the Journal-Star Printing Company. Despite being printed by the same company and sharing offices and production facilities, the publications maintained competing news teams and ran separate stories. In 1971, Joe W. Seacrest chose his son Joe R. Seacrest and his nephew Mark Seacrest to run the Jo\nLancaster County is a county located in the U.S. state of Nebraska.

His three elder brothers were Robert (1843–1926), Edward (1846–1850), and William (1850–1862). Named after his paternal grandfather Thomas Lincoln, he was soon nicknamed \"Tad\" by his father, for his small body and large head, and because as an infant he wiggled like a tadpole. Tad's first name has occasionally been erroneously recorded as Thaddeus.\nTad was born with a form of cleft lip and palate, which caused him speech problems throughout his life. He had a lisp and delivered his words rapidly and unintelligibly. Often only those close to Lincoln were able to understand him. For example, he called his father's bodyguard, William H. Crook, \"Took,\" and his father \"Papa Day\" instead of \"Papa Dear.\" The cleft palate contributed to uneven teeth; he had such difficulty chewing food that his meals were specially prepared.\nLincoln and his brother Willie were considered \"notorious hellions\" during the period they lived in Springfield. William Herndon, Abraham Lincoln's law partner, wrote about the times Lincoln would bring the boys to work with him in Illinois: \"The boys were absolutely unrestrained in their amusement.  If they pulled down all the books from the shelves, bent the points of all the pens, overturned inkstands, scattered law papers over the floor or threw the pencils into the spittoon, it never disturbed the serenity of their father's good nature.\"\n\n\n== White House years ==\n\nUpon their father's election as President, both Tad and Willie moved into the White House and it became their new playground and home. At the request of Mrs. Lincoln, Julia Taft brought her younger brothers, 14-year-old \"Bud\" (Horatio Nelson Taft Jr., 1847–1915) and 12-year-old \"Holly\" (Halsey Cook Taft, 1849–1897), to the White House, and they became playmates of the two young Lincolns.\nIn February 1862, both Lincoln boys contracted typhoid fever and both boys were bedridden. Willie died on February 20, while Tad recovered. However he cried frequently for a month, not only for his brother's death, but for the loss of his other two playmates Bud and Holly, for his mother sent them away after Willie's death, because they reminded her too much of him. After Willie's death, Tad's parents became even more lenient toward Tad's behavior, and Tad spent nearly all his time with his father.\nDuring the time his father was alive, Tad was impulsive and unrestrained, and did not attend school. John Hay wrote that the boy's numerous tutors in the White House usually quit in frustration. Tad had free run of the White House, and there are stories of him interrupting presidential meetings, collecting animals, charging visitors to see his father, and more.\nOn April 14, 1865, Tad went to Grover's Theatre to see the play Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp while his parents attended the performance of Tom Taylor's play Our American Cousin at Ford's Theatre. That night, his father was assassinated by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth. When news of the assassination spread to Grover's Theatre, the manager made an announcement to the entire audience. Tad began running and screaming: \"They killed Papa! They killed Papa!\" Tad was escorted back to the White House, while his mother pleaded to have him brought to his father's deathbed at the Petersen House. \"Bring Tad—he will speak to Tad—he loves him so.\" Late that night, an inconsolable Tad was put to bed by a White House doorman. President Lincoln died the next morning, on Saturday, April 15, at 7:22 am. About the death of his father, Tad said:\n\nPa is dead. I can hardly believe that I shall never see him again. I must learn to take care of myself now. Yes, Pa is dead, and I am only Tad Lincoln now, little Tad, like other littl\nThe University of Nebraska system is the public university system of the U.S. state of Nebraska.

The rivalry is usually held on the Friday after Thanksgiving.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe proximity of the two teams played an important role in the early days of the game, with exclusive trains running between Iowa City and Lincoln to allow fans to travel. The first meeting of the series, which occurred on Thanksgiving Day in Omaha, Nebraska, was the first game Iowa had ever played outside of its home state. Other notable games during the 20th century occurred during the four-year renewal of the rivalry from 1979 to 1982. In the 1979 meeting, #7 Nebraska prevailed over unranked Iowa after overcoming a two-touchdown deficit late in the third quarter, which resulted in a standing ovation from fans of both teams. In the 1981 meeting, unranked Iowa upset #7 Nebraska at Kinnick Stadium in what legendary Iowa coach Hayden Fry called \"the biggest win since I’ve been here.\"\nWhen Nebraska moved to the Big Ten Conference in 2011, the teams resumed the rivalry on an annual basis and played on the Friday following Thanksgiving. Starting that year, the game was referred to as the \"Heroes Game\" and the Heroes Trophy was awarded to the winner. Sponsored by Hy-Vee, the game recognizes individuals from both states for acts of heroism in their communities.\nIn 2017, it was announced by the Big Ten Conference that in 2020 and 2021, the game would not take place on the Friday following Thanksgiving. After significant opposition from fans, Nebraska athletic director Bill Moos made it a priority to restore the game to the Friday after Thanksgiving; accordingly, the Big Ten has scheduled the Iowa-Nebraska game for the Friday after Thanksgiving for all future post-2021 games through 2025. In the end, due to schedule changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 and 2021 games were ultimately rescheduled to Black Friday as well.\nSince 1903, the rivalry has never been contested anyplace besides Lincoln, Nebraska or Iowa City, Iowa; and now alternates between the two respective campuses. Odd-year games are played in Lincoln, while even-year games are played in Iowa City.\n\n\n== Game results ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of NCAA college football rivalry games\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIowa–Nebraska series history Archived December 8, 2015, at the Wayback Machine\nThe Nebraska Zephyr was a streamlined passenger train operated by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q, commonly known by the shorter name of \"Burlington\") between Chicago, Illinois; Omaha, Nebraska; and Lincoln, Nebraska, from 1947 to 1971. Until 1968, the service was provided by two Twin Cities Zephyr articulated trainsets — the \"Train of the Gods\" and \"Train of the Goddesses\" — that became synonymous with it. The Nebraska Zephyr was one of many trains discontinued when Amtrak began operations in 1971. The \"Train of the Goddesses\" set is preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum in Union, Illinois.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Burlington introduced the Nebraska Zephyr on the Chicago–Omaha–Lincoln route on November 16, 1947, replacing the Ak-Sar-Ben Zephyr.: 50  The Zephyr joined four other trains on the route: the Exposition Flyer, Denver Zephyr, Ak-Sar-Ben, and Fast Mail. On-board services included a parlor car, dining car, and cocktail lounge. The trains operated on a daylight schedule between Chicago and Lincoln. Westbound #11 departed Chicago at 12:45 PM and arrived in Lincoln at 10:30 PM. Eastbound #12 departed Lincoln at 11:00 AM and arrived in Chicago at 8:45 PM. The 551-mile (887 km) trip took 9 hours 45 minutes, an average speed of 56 miles per hour (90 km/h).\nAlthough the Burlington removed the distinctive \"Zephyr\" trainsets in February 1968, the train continued to operate as the Nebraska Zephyr, albeit with reduced service. A June 1968 timetable advertised a \"dinette coach\" as the only amenity, and the running time had lengthened to 11 hours 30 minutes. The Nebraska Zephyr lost its name prior to its discontinuance on April 30, 1971.\n\n\n== Equipment ==\n\nThe twin Nebraska Zephyr trainsets were built in 1936 by the Budd Company as the second pair of Twin Zephyrs, built for service between Chicago and Minneapolis-St. Paul, both of which had cars named for classical deities. One trainset was known as the \"Train of the Goddesses\" and its cars were named Venus, Vesta, Minerva, Psyche, Ceres, Diana, and  Juno. The other trainset was known as the \"Train of the Gods\" and its cars were named Apollo, Mars, Neptune, Cupid, Vulcan, Mercury, and Jupiter. Each consist included the following cars: cocktail lounge, two 60-seat coaches, a coach-dinette, dining car, a parlor car, and a parlor-observation car. Early typical motive power for these trains was provided by a pair of shovel-nose diesels named Pegasus (CB&Q #9904) and Zephyrus (CB&Q 9905).: 214 \nIn their original configuration the two parlor cars, Diana and Mercury, had 19 seats and a private drawing room. In 1942, prior to the sets entering service as the Nebraska Zephyr, 42 standard seats replaced the parlor seats. The Burlington added two new baggage cars, the Argo and Olympus, to the trains in February 1948. Finally, cost-cutting in the 1960s led to several changes in the food service arrangements on the trains. In 1963 the Burlington removed the cocktail lounges from the Venus and Apollo, replacing them with 42 coach seats. In 1966 the dining cars Ceres and Vulcan were rebuilt as \"cafeteria cars\" featuring vending machines.: 214 \nThe Burlington withdrew the sets from service in February 1968, though the Nebraska Zephyr continued to operate. The \"Train of the Goddesses\" arrived at the Illinois Railway Museum on September 21, 1968, and it has been in use by the museum since then; it is still operated on short runs on the museum's substantial trackage, providing train enthusiasts and tourists with an experience reminiscent of the heyday of the Burlington's Zephyr service. \nIn 1977 the \"Train of the Gods\" was refurbished, sold by the Burlington, and delivered to Saudi Arabia for use on the Dammam–Riyadh line of the Saudi Railways Organization,  where it operated into the 21st century.: 112  \n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nIllinois Railway Museum official webs\nLincoln, Nebraska has many neighborhoods, including 45 recognized by Urban Development, City of Lincoln.

He led the United States through the American Civil War, defending the nation as a constitutional union, defeating the Confederacy, playing a major role in the abolition of slavery, expanding the power of the federal government, and modernizing the U.S. economy.\nLincoln was born into poverty in a log cabin in Kentucky and was raised on the frontier, mainly in Indiana. He was self-educated and became a lawyer, Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator, and U.S. representative from Illinois. In 1849, he returned to his successful law practice in Springfield, Illinois. In 1854, angered by the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which opened the territories to slavery, he re-entered politics. He soon became a leader of the new Republican Party. He reached a national audience in the 1858 Senate campaign debates against Stephen A. Douglas. Lincoln ran for president in 1860, sweeping the North to gain victory. Pro-slavery elements in the South viewed his election as a threat to slavery, and Southern states began seceding from the nation. They formed the Confederate States of America, which began seizing federal military bases in the South. A little over one month after Lincoln assumed the presidency, Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter, a U.S. fort in South Carolina. Following the bombardment, Lincoln mobilized forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the union.\nLincoln, a moderate Republican, had to navigate a contentious array of factions with friends and opponents from both the Democratic and Republican parties. His allies, the War Democrats and the Radical Republicans, demanded harsh treatment of the Southern Confederates. He managed the factions by exploiting their mutual enmity, carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people. Anti-war Democrats (called \"Copperheads\") despised Lincoln, and some irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements went so far as to plot his assassination. His Gettysburg Address became one of the most famous speeches in American history. Lincoln closely supervised the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals, and implemented a naval blockade of the South's trade. He suspended habeas corpus in Maryland and elsewhere, and he averted war with Britain by defusing the Trent Affair. In 1863, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared the slaves in the states \"in rebellion\" to be free. It also directed the Army and Navy to \"recognize and maintain the freedom of said persons\" and to receive them \"into the armed service of the United States.\" Lincoln pressured border states to outlaw slavery, and he promoted the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which abolished slavery, except as punishment for a crime. Lincoln managed his own successful re-election campaign. He sought to heal the war-torn nation through reconciliation. On April 14, 1865, just five days after the Confederate surrender at Appomattox, he was attending a play at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., with his wife, Mary, when he was fatally shot by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth.\n\nLincoln is remembered as a martyr and a national hero for his wartime leadership, as well as for his efforts to preserve the Union and abolish slavery. Accordingly, he is often ranked in both popular and scholarly polls as the greatest president in American history.\n\n\n== Family and childhood ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\n\nAbraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, the second child of Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks Lincoln, in a log cabin on Sinking Spring Farm near Hodgenville, Kentucky. He was a descendant of Samuel Lincoln, an Englishman who migrated from Hingham, Norfolk, to its namesake, Hingham, Massachusetts, in 1638. The family through subsequent generations migrated west, passing through New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and\nThe 2023 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team represented the University of Nebraska–Lincoln as a member of the West Division of the Big Ten Conference during the 2023 NCAA Division I FBS football season.

The Cornhuskers offense scored 459 points while the defense allowed 162 points.\n\n\n== Before the season ==\nThere was much anticipation for the 1994 season.  The 1993 Nebraska team compiled an 11–0 record in the regular season before narrowly losing to Florida State in the 1994 Orange Bowl on a last-second missed field goal.

The game pitted two teams that had posted undefeated regular-season records in 1993. Quarterback Tommie Frazier was the game's MVP, rushing for 130 yards on 12 carries, including touchdown runs of 25, 27, and 42 yards. He also completed 8 of 16 passes for 100 yards and another touchdown. I-back Lawrence Phillips also ran 126 yards on 24 carries. In all, Nebraska gained 368 rushing yards and 468 total. The Nebraska defense dominated the Mountaineers, registering eight quarterback sacks and holding West Virginia to 8 yards rushing and 89 total yards. Todd Sauerbrun set a record for West Virginia with a 90-yard punt and averaged 60.1 yards on nine punts. The victory marked Nebraska's first shutout victory in two years. It was also Nebraska's first shutout victory against a ranked non-conference opponent since a 20–0 win over No. 19 Baylor in Lincoln 1939, and the first ever such win in a game played outside of Lincoln. The win vaulted Nebraska to No. 1 in the polls.\n\n\n=== Texas Tech ===\n\nNext up was a road victory that saw the Huskers cruise past the Texas Tech Red Raiders, 42–16, which remarkably saw the Huskers drop to #2 in the polls.

Berringer, a pro-style QB from Goodland, Kansas, came off the bench and performed at his best in two straight victories against Wyoming and Oklahoma State, even at times with a partially collapsed lung.  When it became too much for Berringer, walk-on QB Matt Turman stepped up to lead the Cornhuskers against Okie State and in a tough road game that pitched the Huskers against conference foe and neighbor Kansas State.

When European exploration, trade, and settlement began, both Spain and France sought to control the region. In the 1690s, Spain established trade connections with the Apache, whose territory then included western Nebraska. By 1703, France had developed a regular trade with native peoples along the Missouri River in Nebraska, and by 1719 had signed treaties with several of these peoples.

Tad's first name has occasionally been erroneously recorded as Thaddeus.\nTad was born with a form of cleft lip and palate, which caused him speech problems throughout his life. He had a lisp and delivered his words rapidly and unintelligibly. Often only those close to Lincoln were able to understand him. For example, he called his father's bodyguard, William H. Crook, \"Took,\" and his father \"Papa Day\" instead of \"Papa Dear.\" The cleft palate contributed to uneven teeth; he had such difficulty chewing food that his meals were specially prepared."

The conference currently comprises two members, Oregon State and Washington State.\nThe modern Pac-12 Conference formed after the disbanding of the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC), the principal members of which founded the Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU) in 1959. The conference previously went by the names Big Five, Big Six, Pacific-8, and Pacific-10. The Pac-12 moniker was adopted in 2011 with the addition of Colorado and Utah.\nNicknamed the \"Conference of Champions\", the Pac-12 has won more NCAA national championships in team sports than any other conference in history. Washington's national title in women's rowing in 2017 was the 500th NCAA championship won by a Pac-12 school. The Pac-12 holds a 200-plus championship lead over the second-place conference.\nOn August 2, 2024, 10 of the 12 members departed from the conference. The Pac-12 is operating as a two-team conference through the 2025–26 academic year, sponsoring five sports—baseball, football, track and field, women's gymnastics, and wrestling. In 2026, the Pac-12 will expand to eight members with the addition of five schools from the Mountain West Conference and one from the West Coast Conference.\n\n\n== Member universities ==\n\n\n=== Full members ===\nThe Pac-12 currently has two full-member institutions. The conference was previously split into two divisions, the North Division and the South Division, for football only.\n\n\n=== Membership map ===\n\n\n=== Future members ===\nOn September 12, 2024, the conference announced it would be adding four new members, Boise State, Colorado State, Fresno State and San Diego State, on July 1, 2026. The conference needs to add at least two more members before that date to be recognized by the NCAA as an FBS conference. On September 23, 2024, Utah State accepted an offer to join the league as its seventh member. This gave the Pac-12 the seven members needed to preserve its official \"multisport\" status, though one more football-sponsoring full member will be needed to preserve FBS status. On September 30, 2024, the conference announced that Gonzaga would be joining as a full member. \n\n\n=== Affiliate members ===\nThe Pac-12 has two affiliate member institutions in California and one in Arkansas.\n\nNotes\n\n\n=== Former full members ===\nNo school had left the Pac-12 from its founding as the AAWU in 1959 until 2024, when 10 of its 12 schools left. Two members of the PCC, Idaho and Montana, were not invited to join the AAWU or its successors.\n\n\n=== Former affiliate members ===\n\nNotes\n\n\n=== Membership timeline ===\nThe Pac-12 claims the PCC's history as its own. Not only did it maintain the automatic bid from the Rose Bowl inherited from the PCC, but the eight largest schools in the old PCC all eventually joined the new league. However, the old PCC operated under a separate charter.\nThe Pac-12 is one of the founding members of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF), a conference organized to provide competition in non-revenue Olympic sports. All-Pac-12 members participate in at least one MPSF sport (men's and women's indoor track and field both actually have enough participating Pac-12 schools for the conference to sponsor a championship, but the Pac-12 has opted not to do so). For certain sports, the Pac-12 admits certain schools as associate members.\n\n Full members  Full members (non-football) Other Conference  Other Conference  Associate members (non-football)\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pacific Coast Conference ===\n\nThe roots of the Pac-12 Conference go back to December 2, 1915, when the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) was founded at a meeting at the Imperial Hotel in Portland, Oregon. Charter members were the University of \nThe Big 12 Conference is a 16-school collegiate athletic conference headquartered in Irving, Texas. The Big 12 is a member of the Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for all sports. Its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS; formerly Division I-A), the higher of two levels of NCAA Division I football competition. Member schools are located in Arizona, Colorado. Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah,  and West Virginia.\nThe Big 12 Conference is the second youngest of the major college athletic conferences in the United States. It was formed in 1994 when all 8 members of one of the oldest conferences, the Big Eight, were joined by 4 of the Texas members of one of the other oldest conferences, the Southwest Conference. From its formation until 2011, its 12 members competed in two divisions. Major membership changes came during the 2010–2013 Big 12 Conference realignment and still more changes came or will come during the 2021–2024 NCAA conference realignment.\nIn 2012, the Big 12 Conference formed an alliance with the Southeastern Conference for a 12-year deal starting in the 2014 season to host a joint post-season college bowl game between the champions of each conference in the Sugar Bowl (except for the 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2023 seasons when the bowl game is used as a College Football Playoff semifinal game).\n\n\n== Origins ==\n\n\n=== College Football Association last days ===\nOn June 27, 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma that the NCAA could not punish its membership for selling their media content. As a result, individual schools and athletic conferences were freed to negotiate contracts on their own behalf.\nThe Big Ten and Pacific-10 conferences sold their rights to ABC.  Most of the rest of the Division I-A football programs (what is now called the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, or FBS) chose to sell their rights together through an organization called the College Football Association to ABC and CBS.  The primary function of the CFA was to negotiate television broadcast rights for its member conferences and independent colleges.\nBy 1990, the television landscape had changed and a number of the stronger programs saw opportunities for better deals outside of the CFA. Notre Dame left the CFA and sold their home game broadcast rights to NBC.\nWhen the Southeastern Conference (SEC) invited the University of Arkansas and the University of South Carolina to join in 1990, it created shockwaves across the CFA. The other CFA conferences correctly assumed the SEC made these additions to create a better TV product with the idea of leaving the CFA.\nThe SEC represented one of the more valuable CFA assets.  It seemed likely that if the SEC departed, the other conferences could have difficulty securing good TV deals.\nAfter Arkansas' departure from the Southwest Conference, the SWC and Big Eight Conference recognized they were in a poor position. The SEC, with about 18% of the nation's TV audience, had a very strong TV position. The Big 8 had an 8.1% share.  The Texas-based SWC had an even weaker hand with only 6.7%.\nIn February 1994, the SEC announced that it would leave the CFA and negotiate independently for a television deal that covered SEC schools only.  This led The Dallas Morning News to proclaim that \"the College Football Association as a television entity is dead\".  In 1995, the SEC and the Big East broke from the CFA, signing a national deal with CBS.  The SEC would earn a staggering $95 million from the deal.  More significantly, this change in television contracts ultimately would lead to a significant realignment of college conferences.\n\n\n=== The Southwest Conference ===\nFor decades the Southwest Conference (SWC) was one of the most dominant football conferences in America. It was seen as a football peer to other elite conferences like the Pacific Coast Conference (precursor to today's Pac-12), Big Ten\nThe 2024 Big 12 Conference football season will be the 29th season of the Big 12 Conference football taking place during the 2024 NCAA Division I FBS football season.\nThe 2024 season is the first season for the Big 12 to have 16 members, with the departure of Oklahoma and Texas, the return of Colorado after a 13-season absence, and the addition of Arizona, Arizona State, and Utah.\nThe 2024 Big 12 Championship Game will be played at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas on December 7, 2024, between the two highest finishing teams in the conference.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Previous season ===\nThe Texas Longhorns defeated the Oklahoma State Cowboys 49–21 in the Big 12 championship.\nNine teams participated in bowl games, finishing with a record of 5–4.

The game was played each year since the conference's formation in 1996 until 2010 and returned during the 2017 season. From 1996 to 2010, the championship game pitted the Big 12 North Division champion against the South Division champion in a game held after the regular season was completed. From 2017 onward, the game features the two teams with the best conference records.\nIn the first eight Big 12 championship games, from 1996 to 2003, the divisions split four games each, with the north champion winning in every odd-numbered year and the south champion winning in every even-numbered year. However, the North division champion did not win after No. 13 Kansas State's 35–7 upset victory over No. 1 Oklahoma in 2003.\nThe Big 12 is under contract to play the game at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas until 2030.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first championship game was played after the 1996 regular season, the first year of play for the Big 12 (which was created from the merger of the Big Eight Conference and four teams from the Southwest Conference). Like the SEC Championship Game (which has been played since 1992), the game matched the winners of the conference's two six-team divisions. The championship game was held at several sites within the Big 12 states, with Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, hosting more often than any other venue.\nThe 2008 Big 12 Championship Game was notable for the controversy over choosing the South Division representative. The Oklahoma Sooners, Texas Longhorns, and Texas Tech Red Raiders all finished with identical records and had each recorded a win and loss among one another. The Sooners earned a berth to the title game because they had the highest Bowl Championship Series ranking of the three at the time of selection. Oklahoma defeated the Missouri Tigers and earned a berth in the 2009 BCS National Championship Game.\nFrom 2009 through 2013, the game was scheduled to be played at Cowboys Stadium, now known as AT&T Stadium, in Arlington, Texas. During June 2010, however, Nebraska and Colorado announced that they would leave the Big 12 for other conferences (the Big Ten Conference and the Pac-12 Conference, respectively) in 2011. Because NCAA rules at the time required that a conference have 12 members in order to stage a football championship game that was exempt from NCAA limits on regular-season games, the conference dropped the championship game following the 2010 season. During this time, Oklahoma and Texas had expressed that a conference title game hurt the chances of the conference to have a representative in the BCS National Championship Game, and now the College Football Playoff, which started in 2014.\nIn December 2014 after completing the first season with the College Football Playoff, Baylor and TCU both finished the season with an 8–1 conference record and were declared co-champions by the conference despite Baylor's head-to-head win over TCU. When the selection committee met to set the teams for the first playoff, both Baylor and TCU were overlooked in favor of teams that competed in and won their conference's championship game, leaving the Big 12 out of the playoffs. This led to criticism of how the Big 12 determined its champion.\nIn April 2015, legislation was developed by the ACC and the Big 12 to deregulate conference championship games. It was announced by NCAA officials as being expected to pass in time for the start of the 2016 season.  The legislation passed on January 14, 2016 allowing a conference with fewer than twelve teams to stage a championship game between the top two teams, so long as they play a round-robin schedule. In late 2016, the Big 12 decided to bring back the championship game in 2017 after a seven-year-long gap of having no conference championship game.\n\n\n== Results ==\nBelow are the results from all Big 12 Championship Games played\nThe American Athletic Conference (AAC), also known as The American, is a collegiate athletic conference in the United States, featuring 13 full member universities and six affiliate member universities that compete in The National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Division I. Its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). Member universities represent a range of private and public research universities of various enrollment sizes located primarily in urban metropolitan areas in the Northeastern, Midwestern, and Southern regions of the United States.\nThe American's legal predecessor, the original Big East Conference, was considered one of the six collegiate power conferences of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) era in college football, and The American inherited that status in the BCS's final season. With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, The American became a \"Group of Five\" conference, which shares one automatic spot in the New Year's Six bowl games.\nThe league is the product of substantial turmoil in The Old Big East during The 2010–14 conference realignment period. It is one of two conferences to emerge from the all-sports Big East in 2013. While the other successor, which does not sponsor football, purchased The Big East Conference name, The American inherited The Old Big East's structure and is that conference's legal successor. However, both conferences claim 1979 as their founding date, and the same history up to 2013. The American Athletic Conference is headquartered in Irving, Texas, and led by Commissioner Tim Pernetti, who replaced the retiring Mike Aresco on June 1, 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The Big East ===\n\nThe Big East Conference was founded in 1979 as a basketball conference and included the colleges of Providence, St. John's, Georgetown, and Syracuse, which in turn invited Connecticut (UConn), Holy Cross, Rutgers, and Boston College to be members. UConn and Boston College would accept the invitation, while Holy Cross soon thereafter declined the invitation, and Rutgers eventually declined and remained in the Atlantic 10 Conference (then known as the Eastern 8 Conference). Seton Hall was then invited as a replacement and the conference started play with seven members.\nVillanova and Pittsburgh joined shortly thereafter under the leadership of the first Big East commissioner, Dave Gavitt.\nThe conference remained largely unchanged until 1991, when it began to sponsor football, adding Miami as a full member, and Rutgers, Temple, Virginia Tech, and West Virginia as football-only members. Rutgers and West Virginia were offered full all-sports membership in 1995, while Virginia Tech waited until 2000 for the same offer. Temple football was kicked out after the 2004 season, but rejoined in 2012 and intended to become a full member in 2013.\nThe unusual structure of the Big East, with the \"football\" and \"non-football\" schools, led to instability in the conference. The waves of defection and replacement brought about by the conference realignments of 2005 and the early 2010s revealed tension between the football-sponsoring and non-football schools that eventually led to the split of the conference in 2013.\n\n\n=== Realignment and reorganization ===\n\nThe conference was reorganized following the tumultuous period of realignment that hobbled the Big East between 2010 and 2013. The Big East was one of the most severely impacted conferences during the early-2010s conference realignment period. In all, 14 member schools announced their departure for other conferences, and 15 other schools announced plans to join the conference (eight as all-sports members, and four for football only). Three of the latter group later backed out of their plans to join (one for all sports, and the other two for football only).\nOn December 15, 2012, the Big East's seven remaining non-FBS schools, all Catholic institutions consisting of DePaul, Georgetown, Marquette, Providence, St. John's, Seton Hall, a\nThe Big 12 Conference is a group of 16 (originally 12) universities which compete in the NCAA Division I level.  The conference was formed in 1994 but did not begin conference play until the fall of 1996.  The schools that composed the Big 12 Conference in the most recent 2022–23 season, except West Virginia, were members of either the Big Eight Conference or the Southwest Conference, and have won six national titles including three titles since the inception of the Big 12 Conference.\nThe conference expanded to 16 members in the 2024–25 season with the return of charter-member Colorado, and the arrival of Arizona, Arizona State, and Utah.\n\n\n== Membership ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\n\n\n=== Former members ===\n\n\n== Standings ==\n\n\n=== All-time records ===\n\nTotals though the end of the 2023-24 season.\n\n\n=== Overall series records in Big 12 Play ===\n1997 - 2024 as Big 12 Members\nSource:Note: Some of the values from the bottom of page 32 don't match with the detailed numbers given on pages 33–41 so that latter values were used: *\n\nTotals though the end of the 2023–24 season.

It was formed in January 1907 as the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MVIAA) by its charter member schools: the University of Kansas, University of Missouri, University of Nebraska, and Washington University in St. Louis. Additionally, the University of Iowa was an original member of the MVIAA, while maintaining joint membership in the Western Conference (now the Big Ten Conference).\nThe conference's membership at its dissolution consisted of the University of Nebraska, Iowa State University, the University of Colorado at Boulder, the University of Kansas, Kansas State University, the University of Missouri, the University of Oklahoma, and Oklahoma State University. The Big Eight's headquarters were located in Kansas City, Missouri.\nIn February 1994, all eight members of the Big Eight Conference and four of the members of the Southwest Conference announced that the 12 schools had reached an agreement to form the Big 12 Conference. From a conventional standpoint, the Big 12 was a renamed and expanded Big Eight. But from a legal standpoint, the Big Eight ceased operations in 1996, and its members joined with the four SWC schools (Texas, Texas A&M, Baylor, and Texas Tech) to form the Big 12 the following year.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation ===\nThe conference was founded as the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MVIAA) at a meeting on January 12, 1907, of five charter member institutions: the University of Kansas, the University of Missouri, the University of Nebraska, Washington University in St. Louis, and the University of Iowa, which also maintained its concurrent membership in the Western Conference (now the Big Ten Conference). However, Iowa only participated in football and outdoor men's track and field for a brief period before leaving the conference in 1911.\n\n\n=== Early membership changes ===\nIn 1908, Drake University and Iowa Agricultural College (now Iowa State University) joined the MVIAA, increasing the conferences membership to seven. Iowa, which was a joint member, departed the conference in 1911 to return to sole competition in the Western Conference, but Kansas State University joined the conference in 1913. Nebraska left in 1918 to play as an independent for two seasons before returning in 1920. In 1919, the University of Oklahoma and Saint Louis University applied for membership, but were not approved due to deficient management of their athletic programs. The conference then added Grinnell College in 1919, with the University of Oklahoma applying again and being approved in 1920. Oklahoma A&M University (now Oklahoma State University) joined in 1925, bringing conference membership to ten, an all-time high.\n\n\n=== Split into Big Six Conference ===\nAt a meeting in Lincoln, Nebraska, on May 19, 1928, the conference split up. Six of the seven state schools (all except Oklahoma A&M) formed a conference that was initially known as the Big Six Conference. Just before the start of fall practice, the six schools announced they would retain the MVIAA name for formal purposes. However, fans and media continued to call it the Big Six. The three private schools – Drake, Grinnell, and Washington University – joined with Oklahoma A&M to form the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC). The old MVIAA's administrative staff transferred to the MVC.\nThe similarity of the two conferences' official names, as well as the competing claims of the two conferences, led to considerable debate over which conference was the original and which was the spin-off, though the MVIAA went on to become the more prestigious of the two. For the remainder of the Big Eight's run, both conferences claimed 1907 as their founding date, as well as the same history through 1927. To this day, it has never been definitively established which conference was the original.\n\nThe Big 12 Conference sponsors championships in 25 sports, 10 men's and 15 women's, with two women's sports to be added in the 2024–25 school year. The first conference championship awarded was the 1996 softball postseason tournament championship, which was won by Oklahoma.\nFrom 2011 through 2016, the football champion was decided by regular-season play. Previously divisional titles were awarded based on regular-season conference results, with the teams with the best conference records from the North and South playing in the Big 12 Championship Game for the Big 12 title. Following changes in NCAA rules, the Big 12 will reinstate its football championship game in 2017, with the top two teams in the final conference standings advancing to the title game. Baseball, basketball, soccer, and tennis titles are awarded in both regular-season and tournament play. Cross country, golf, gymnastics, rowing, swimming and diving, track and field, and wrestling titles are awarded during an annual meet of participating teams. The volleyball and softball titles are awarded based on regular-season play. Softball previously held a post season tournament.\n\n\n== Membership ==\n\n\n=== Current membership ===\n\n\n=== Former members ===\n\nAssociate members joining in 2024:\n\nWomen's lacrosse\nFlorida Gators\nSan Diego State Aztecs\nUC Davis Aggies\nWomen's rowing\nOld Dominion Monarchs\nTulsa Golden Hurricane\nWrestling\nOklahoma Sooners\n\n\n== Baseball ==\n\nAll current Big 12 members sponsor baseball except Iowa State, which dropped the sport after the 2001 season, and Colorado, which never sponsored baseball during its first conference tenure and still does not sponsor the sport.\n\n\n== Men's basketball ==\n\n\n== Women's basketball ==\n\n\n== Beach volleyball ==\nBeach volleyball, organized by the NCAA only for women, is the first of two women's sports to be added in 2024–25.

As a result, the following teams are also recognized as champions by the Big 12:\nNorth Co-Champions: Kansas State (1999), Nebraska (2000, 2001, 2008), Iowa State (2004), Kansas (2007), Missouri (2010)\nSouth Co-Champions: Texas (2002, 2008), Texas Tech (2008), Oklahoma State (2010), Texas A&M (2010)\n\n2011–2016\nWhen Nebraska and Colorado left the conference after the 2010 season, it left the conference with only 10 members.

From 1996 to 2010 the championship game pitted the Big 12 North Division champion against the South Division champion in a game held after the regular season was completed.\nBetween 2011 and 2016, the championship was earned in round-robin regular-season play among all conference members. Until 2014, the league did not employ tiebreaking procedures, such as head-to-head results, to determine a single champion, and thus it was not unusual for a season to end with \"co-champions.\" However with the 2015 season, head-to-head results will decide if two teams finish tied.\nFrom 2017 onward, the championship game features the two teams with the best conference records. The champion usually is invited to the Sugar Bowl unless selected to play in one of the national semifinals for the College Football Playoff. Co-champions are listed in alphabetical order. Co-champions are no longer possible as the Big 12 Conference has switched to using a Conference Championship game to determine the winner.\n\n\n== Champions by year ==\n\nBold indicates a national championship.\n\n\n== Championships by team ==\n\nItalics indicate a shared title.\n* indicates a school no longer competing in the Big 12.\n\n\n== Big 12 Championship Game ==\n\nSince 2017, the championship game has determined the conference champion.

Conference realignment saw the Big 12 expand to 14 teams for 2025, The 2025 tournament will be a Single-elimination tournament with the top 12 teams in the final regular season standings qualifying for tournament.  The top four teams in final regular season standings will receive byes into the second round.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Big 12 tournament was first played in 1997 at All Sports Stadium in Oklahoma City, before moving to Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark the following year. The tournament has been played in Oklahoma City each year, save for 2002 and 2004, when the event was played in Arlington, Texas, at the home park of Major League Baseball's Texas Rangers.

Founded as the Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives in 1896, it predates the founding of its regulating organization, the NCAA. It is based in the Chicago area in Rosemont, Illinois. For many decades the conference consisted of ten prominent universities, which accounts for its name. On August 2, 2024, the conference expanded to 18 member institutions and 2 affiliate institutions. The conference competes in the NCAA Division I and its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), formerly known as Division I-A, the highest level of NCAA competition in that sport.\nBig Ten member institutions are major research universities with large financial endowments and strong academic reputations. A large student body is a hallmark of its universities, as 15 of the 18 members enroll more than 30,000 students. They are all public universities except Northwestern University and the University of Southern California, both private universities. Collectively, Big Ten universities educate more than 520,000 total students and have 5.7 million living alumni. The members engage in $9.3 billion in funded research each year; 17 out of 18 are members of the Association of American Universities (except Nebraska) and the Universities Research Association (except USC). All Big Ten universities are also members of the Big Ten Academic Alliance, formerly the Committee on Institutional Cooperation.\nAlthough the Big Ten has primarily been a Midwestern conference for nearly a century, the conference's geographic footprint has extended from the Mid-Atlantic to the Great Plains since 2014. In 2024, the conference gained a presence in the West Coast with the addition of four former Pac-12 Conference schools.\n\n\n== Member universities ==\n\n\n=== Current full members ===\n\nNotes:\n\n\n=== Membership map ===\n\n\n=== Affiliate members ===\n\nNotes\n\n\n=== Former member ===\nThe University of Chicago is the only full member to have permanently left the Big Ten Conference.\n\nNotes\n\n\n=== Membership timeline ===\n\nFull members  Full members (non-football)  Sport affiliate  Other conference  Other conference \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nAs intercollegiate football rapidly increased during the 1890s, so did the ruthless nature of the game. Tempers flared, fights erupted, and injuries soared. Between 1880 and 1905, college football players suffered more than 325 deaths and 1,149 injuries.  To deal with mounting criticism of the game, Purdue University president James Henry Smart invited the presidents of the University of Chicago, University of Illinois, Lake Forest College, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University, and University of Wisconsin to a meeting in Chicago on January 11, 1895, to create policies aimed at regulating intercollegiate athletics. The eligibility of student-athletes was one of the main topics of discussion. The Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives was founded at a second meeting on February 8, 1896. Lake Forest was not at the 1896 meeting and was replaced by the University of Michigan. At the time, the organization was more commonly known as the Western Conference, consisting of Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Chicago, Purdue, and Northwestern. These schools were the original seven members.\nThe conference is one of the nation's oldest, predating the founding of the NCAA by a decade and was one of the first collegiate conferences to sponsor men's basketball.\nThe first reference to the conference as the Big Nine was in 1899 after Iowa and Indiana had joined. Nebraska first petitioned to join the league in 1900 and again in 1911, but was turned away both times.\nIn 1905, the conference was officially incorporated as the \"Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives\".\nIn April 1907, Michiga\nThe 2023 Big 12 Conference football season was the 28th season of the Big 12 Conference football taking place during the 2023 NCAA Division I FBS football season.\nThe 2023 season was the first season for the Big 12 to have 14 members, with BYU, Cincinnati, Houston, and UCF joining the conference. It was also the last season for founding conference members Oklahoma and Texas, who left for the Southeastern Conference prior to the start of the 2024 season.\nThe 2023 Big 12 Championship Game was played at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas on December 2, 2023, between Texas and Oklahoma State. Texas won 49–21, winning their fourth Big 12 championship in team history.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Previous season ===\nThe Kansas State Wildcats defeated the TCU Horned Frogs in overtime 31–28 in the Big 12 title game.\nEight teams participated in bowl games, finishing with a record of 2–7.

They are part of the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of NCAA Division I, the highest level of collegiate football in the nation, and are considered the most elite conferences within that tier. Power conferences have provided most of the participants in the College Football Playoff since its inception, and generally have larger revenue, budgets, and television viewership than other college athletic programs.\nThe grouping currently consists of the Power Four conferences of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), Big Ten Conference, Big 12 Conference, and Southeastern Conference (SEC) as a result of the collapse of the Pac-12 Conference amid widespread conference realignment following the 2023 season. There are also suggestions from sportswriters that the Big Ten and SEC currently form a \"Power Two\" tier above the ACC and Big 12, with further moves and realignment sure to come in the future.\nThe conferences were known as the Power Five during the 4-team College Football Playoff (CFP) era and the later years of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). The BCS began in 1998 with six Automatic Qualifying conferences of the ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Big East, SEC, and Pac-12. The Big East's loss of stature during realignment in 2005 resulted in the term \"Power Five\" being used to refer to the remaining top tier of teams.\nThe FBS consists of the Power Four, five other conferences known as the Group of Five (G5), the two-member Pac-12 Conference, and a small number of independent schools. The term Power Conference is not defined by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), but the Power Four conferences are identified individually under NCAA rules as \"autonomy conferences\", which grants them some independence from standard NCAA rules to provide additional resources for the benefit of student-athletes. The power conferences also compete in numerous sports outside of football, but are not necessarily the most prominent conferences in each individual sport. For example, in men's college basketball, the modern Big East Conference is also generally considered to be a power conference.\nEach of the power conferences existed for decades before the establishment of the College Football Playoff, with the oldest power conference, the Big Ten, founded in 1896. By the middle of the 20th century, the top conferences sent teams to postseason bowl games such as the Rose Bowl or the Sugar Bowl, but the bowl season frequently ended with multiple teams claiming the national championship. In 1998, the current Power Four conferences joined with the Pac-12, the original incarnation of the Big East Conference, Notre Dame, and several leading bowl games to create the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). The BCS determined the college football FBS national champion until it was supplanted by the College Football Playoff in 2014, and each of the six founding conferences were known as \"automatic qualifying\" conferences since they received an automatic bid to one of the BCS bowl games. After the Big East lost several members and split into two conferences in 2013, its football successor, the American Athletic Conference, became part of the Group of Five. The Pac-12 was a member of the Power Five conferences but lost its autonomy conference status and most of its membership in 2024, leading to the current state of four power conferences.\n\n\n== List of conferences and teams ==\n\nThe ten FBS conferences as of the 2024–2025 academic year are listed.

The conference's members participated in 24 NCAA sports. The conference had a history of success at the national level in basketball throughout its history, while its shorter (1991 to 2013) football program, created by inviting one college and four other \"associate members\" (their football programs only) into the conference, resulted in two national championships.\nIn basketball, Big East teams made 18 Final Four appearances and won 7 NCAA championships as Big East members through 2013 (UConn with three, Georgetown, Syracuse, Louisville and Villanova with one each). Of the Big East's full members, all but South Florida attended the Final Four, the most of any conference, though Marquette, DePaul, Notre Dame, Rutgers, Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh made all their trips before joining the Big East. In 2011, the Big East set the record for the most teams sent to the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship by a single conference with eleven out of their sixteen teams qualifying.\nIn football, the Big East entered competition as a conference in 1991, after inviting five football colleges to become members of the Big East, joining three teams from the Big East whose football teams were competing as Division I independents (Boston College, Pittsburgh and Syracuse) to form a new Division I football league. The strength of this league earned the Big East an automatic berth in the Bowl Championship Series, when that series was created in 1998. The Big East won two national football championships, both by University of Miami. Between 2005 and 2012, four of the more successful football schools left the Big East for other conferences, starting a process that led to a complete realignment of the Big East in 2013.\nOn July 1, 2013, the non-football playing schools (also known collectively as the Catholic 7) formed a non-football playing conference that purchased the Big East Conference name. The remaining six football-playing members, three of whom had only joined the Big East in 2005 when the earlier exodus had started, joined with four schools from other conferences to become the American Athletic Conference (The American/AAC), which is the Big East's legal successor. The American retains the Big East's football structure and inherited its single automatic berth in the Bowl Championship Series. However, both conferences claim 1979 as their founding date, and the same history up to 2013.  As of the 2023–24 season, South Florida is the only full member of the original Big East that still plays in the AAC today.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding: the early years ===\nThe Big East, often referred to as the Classic Big East, was founded in 1979 after new NCAA basketball scheduling requirements caused the athletic directors of independent schools Providence, St. John's, Georgetown, and Syracuse to discuss the creation of a conference centered in the Northeast. Other schools invited were Seton Hall, Connecticut, Holy Cross, Rutgers, and Boston College, with Rutgers and Holy Cross declining to join. Villanova joined a year later in 1980 and Pittsburgh joined in 1982. Before the formation of the conference, many of these schools participated in the ECAC men's basketball tournament in order to receive an automatic bid for the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship.\nIn 1982, Penn State applied for membership, but was rejected, with only five schools in favor (Penn State needed six out of eight). It was long rumored that Syracuse cast the deciding vote against Penn State, but Mike Tranghese confirmed that this was not the case and that Syracuse had, in fact, voted for Penn State's inclusion.  Penn State would loom large over the conference during future rounds of realignment as the Nittany Lions had the potential to shore up the conference once football members began to join.  Followin\nThe 2024–25 Big 12 men's basketball season will begin with the start of the 2024–25 NCAA Division I men's basketball season in November. Regular season conference play will begin in December 2024 and conclude in March 2025. The 2025 Big 12 Conference men's basketball tournament will be held March, 2025, at the T-Mobile Center in Kansas City, Missouri.\nThis will be the first season for the Big 12 Conference with 16 teams after the addition of Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado and Utah, plus the departure of Oklahoma and Texas.\n\n\n== Coaches ==\n\n\n=== Coaching changes ===\n\n\n=== Head coaches ===\nNote: Stats are through the beginning of the season.

All 10 FBS conferences that existed at the start of the realignment cycle have seen or will see changes in their core membership.\nThe Associated Press named conference realignment, and in particular the collapse of the Pac-12 Conference, as the 2023 story of the year in U.S. sports. The Pac-12 Conference lost ten of its twelve members ahead of the 2024-25 academic year, leading to lawsuits and to ad-hoc arrangements for its remaining two members until newly invited members could join in 2026.\nThe Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) also saw significant changes, most notably the beginning of football sponsorship by the Atlantic Sun Conference (ASUN); the return of football by the Western Athletic Conference (WAC), which previously sponsored football at the FBS level until the end of the 2012 season; and two football-only conference mergers, one involving the ASUN and WAC and the other involving the Big South Conference and Ohio Valley Conference (OVC).\nOther sports saw significant change:\n\nIn men's ice hockey, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) was reestablished by seven members of the men's Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA), which led to the WCHA disbanding its men's league and becoming a women-only conference. Also, the men-only Atlantic Hockey Association and the women-only College Hockey America announced they would merge into a single conference, later unveiled as Atlantic Hockey America, after the 2023–24 season.\nIn men's soccer, the Sun Belt Conference reinstated the sport, ultimately leading to both Conference USA (CUSA) and the Mid-American Conference dropping the sport, and the OVC also added the sport.\nThe Atlantic 10 Conference launched a men's lacrosse league, leading to the Northeast Conference (NEC) and the Southern Conference dropping the sport. However, the NEC later reinstated men's lacrosse in 2024–25.\nThe NEC became the second D-I all-sports conference to sponsor men's volleyball.\nThe West Coast Conference and the Big West Conference added men's water polo, which led to the demise of the men's side of the water polo-only Golden Coast Conference.\nIn men's wrestling, the Ivy League announced it would hold its own conference championship meet starting in 2024–25, ending a century-long de facto relationship with the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association.\nThe Mountain West Conference began sponsoring women's gymnastics, leading to the demise of the single-sport Mountain Rim Gymnastics Conference.\nSeveral all-sports conferences underwent single-sport mergers or transfers of sponsorship:\nThe OVC merged its men's tennis league into the Horizon League.\nThe Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference merged its baseball league into the NEC.\nThe Southland Bowling League was absorbed by CUSA.\nThe ASUN added men's and women's swimming & diving, effectively taking over the aquatics side of the Coastal Collegiate Sports Association and leaving the latter a beach volleyball-only conference.\nSponsorship of men's swimming & diving transferred from the Mid-American Conference to the Missouri Valley Conference.\n\n\n== FBS conferences affected ==\n\n\n=== Southeastern Conference ===\nOn July 21, 2021, the Houston Chronicle reported that Oklahoma and Texas had approached the Southeastern Conference (SEC) about the possibility of joining that league. On July 26, Oklahoma and Texas notified the Big 12 Conference that the two schools did not wish to extend their grant of television rights beyond the 2024–25 athletic year and intended to leave the conference. On July 29, the presidents and chancellors of the 14 SEC members voted unanimously to extend invitations to Oklahoma and Texas, effective in 2025. The two schools eventually reached a buyout agreement with the Big 12 t\nThe Colorado Buffaloes football program represents the University of Colorado Boulder in college football at the NCAA Division I FBS level, and is a member of the Big 12 Conference. The team was a charter member of the Big 12 before leaving to join the Pac-12 Conference after the 2010 season. After 13 seasons in the Pac-12, the Buffaloes returned to the Big 12 in 2024. Before joining the Big 12, they were members of the Big Eight Conference. The CU football team has played at Folsom Field since 1924.  The Buffs all-time record is 716–520–36 (.577 winning percentage) as of the 2022 season. Colorado won the 1990 National Championship.  The football program is 27th on the all-time win list and 40th in all-time winning percentage.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBeginning in 1890, the Buffaloes have appeared in 29 bowl games (36th all-time), and won 27 conference championships, 5 division championships and an AP national championship in 1990.\nFolsom Field was built in 1924, and since then, Colorado has a 308–169–14 record at home through the 2016 season. The road game against the Nebraska Cornhuskers on November 24, 2006, was Colorado's 1,100th football game.

While the Georgia Tech won the United Press International Coaches Poll, Colorado won the Associated Press, Football Writers Association of America and other polls.  Colorado played the most difficult schedule in the country, beat more ranked teams and conference champions, and had a more talented roster. Colorado capped the season with a 10–9 win over Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl, a rematch of the 1989 season Orange Bowl Game which Notre Dame won 21–6. Colorado's tie came against Tennessee, who was ranked No. 8, the first week of the season when Colorado was ranked No. 5. The second week gave the Buffs a scare, scoring with 12 seconds left in the game on a 4th and Goal attempt. The next week gave Colorado its only loss of the season, losing 23–22 to Illinois and dropping Colorado to No. 20 in the polls. Colorado then went on to beat teams ranked (at the time) No. 22 Texas, No. 12 Washington, No. 22 Oklahoma, and No. 3 Nebraska. They ended the season 7–0 in the Big Eight Conference for the second straight season. They then capped the season with a win over Notre Dame who were number 1 until a loss in their second to last game of the regular season.\n\n\n=== Conference championships ===\n\nColorado has won 26 conference championships in over a century of college play, spanning through five conferences.\n\n† Co-champions\n\n\n=== Division championships ===\n\n† Co-champions\n\n\n== Head coaches ==\n\nThe Buffaloes have played in 1,109 games during their 125 seasons, through 2014.

Mazur, Bud Davis, Eddie Crowder, Bill Mallory, Bill McCartney, Rick Neuheisel, Gary Barnett, Dan Hawkins, Mike MacIntyre and Karl Dorrell. Ten coaches have won conference championships with the Buffaloes: Fred Folsom, Myron Witham, William Saunders, Oakes, Jim Yeager, Sonny Grandelius, Mallory, McCartney and Barnett.

It is a single-elimination tournament of four rounds, with the top six seeds getting byes in the first round. Seeding is based on regular season records.\nThe winner of the tournament receives the Big 12 Conference automatic bid to the NCAA Championship tournament.\nBetween 2005 and 2019, no current Big 12 member besides Iowa State or Kansas won the tournament, and those two schools have won 18 of 27 titles. The remaining current Big 12 schools only account for six additional tournament titles. For its first twenty-three years, no school from outside the original Big Eight Conference had ever won the tournament. This streak ended when the Texas Longhorns won the championship game against Oklahoma State in 2021.\nThe tournament is set to be held at the T-Mobile Center (formerly Sprint Center) in Kansas City, Missouri until 2031.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe tournament has been held every year since the first full basketball season was completed in 1997. (The Big 12 was formed in 1996)  Since that time, it was held in Kemper Arena in Kansas City, Missouri in early March for every year up until 2003, and also in 2005. In 2003, 2004, and 2006 it was held at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas, and in 2007 it was held in the Ford Center at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In 2008 it was again held in Kansas City, but this time at the Sprint Center.\nThe 2009 edition of the championship was held in Oklahoma City, with the event returning to Kansas City from 2010 through 2020. On October 24, 2018, it was announced that the Big 12 Tournament would stay in Kansas City through 2024, and on June 12, 2020, it was announced that it would stay in Kansas City through 2025. Kansas has won the most Big 12 postseason titles as well, winning 12 out of 25, while appearing in 15 championship games.\n\n\n== Tournament champions ==\nNumbers in parentheses refer to each team's finish/seed in the tournament for that year.

Part of a larger NCAA conference realignment that began in the 2010–11 academic year and continued through 2013–14, the Big 12 was one of the more severely impacted conferences. In all, four schools left during this cycle (Colorado, Missouri, Nebraska, Texas A&M) and two joined (West Virginia, TCU).\n\n\n== First wave ==\nNebraska announced that it would leave the Big 12 Conference for the Big Ten Conference effective in 2011.\nColorado also announced a change in conference alignment; originally planning to transfer to the Pac-10 for the 2012–13 season, the school agreed to depart a year early after Nebraska announced its plans to depart the conference in 2011.\nWith the loss of Colorado (who had been a member of the Big 12 and its predecessor the Big Eight Conference since 1947) to the Pac-10 and Nebraska (whose association with the Big 12 dates back to the 1907 founding of what was to become the Big Eight) to the Big Ten, the Big 12 was reduced to ten teams and faced more possible attrition.\nOther Big 12 schools were rumored to be candidates for expansion by other conferences, including further expansion by the Pac-10 or Big Ten. Speculation and rumors centered on Texas, Texas Tech, Oklahoma, and Oklahoma State following Colorado to the Pac-10. Texas A&M was also considered as a PAC-10 candidate but was also reportedly considering a move to the SEC.\nESPN reported on June 11 that Texas, Texas Tech, and the two Oklahoma schools were prepared to accept an invitation from the Pac-10. The report also indicated that Texas A&M was torn between the Pac-10 and SEC and was given a 72-hour deadline to decide on its future destination. Meanwhile, Baylor announced that it would wait and see what the final outcome of the Big 12's realignment would be before making any final decision concerning where they would go if the Big 12 dissolved. On June 14, ESPN, citing sources within the Big 12, initially reported that Texas, Texas Tech, Oklahoma, and Oklahoma State would join the Pac-10 no later than June 15, while Texas A&M was now most likely to opt for the SEC. The remaining Big 12 schools Baylor, Iowa State, Kansas, Kansas State, and Missouri may have been left to find new leagues, with early speculation pointing to a possible move for some of those schools to the Mountain West or Big East conferences. Kansas men's basketball coach Bill Self stated, on the day that TCU announced its entry into the Big East, that had the Big 12 collapsed the Big East would have offered membership to Kansas, Kansas State, Iowa State, and Missouri.\nOn June 14, reports started surfacing that the almost certain departure of Texas (and, along with them, several other schools) from the Big 12 would not happen. Indications were that a last-minute effort by Big 12 Commissioner Dan Beebe to hold the 10-remaining Big 12 teams together might be successful. Beebe's plan showed that the remaining 10 schools could nearly double their television revenue if they stuck with the Big 12. In addition, Beebe said that Texas would be allowed to start its own network if the school stayed with the Big 12—a business move that Texas has wanted to do that would not be allowed in the Pac-10. If Texas decided to stay with the Big 12, that had the potential to effectively end any further realignment in the NCAA, save for one or two moves in the Pac-10 and Mountain West Conference. However, others were saying that while Texas might want to keep the Big 12 together with this deal, the remaining Big 12 South teams that were considering departing the Big 12 (Texas Tech, Texas A&M, Oklahoma and Oklahoma State) would not be interested in a deal that would give a school that already has a competitive advantage an even larger one.\nLater that day, Andy Katz of ESPN.com, citing an NCAA sour",

To deal with mounting criticism of the game, Purdue University president James Henry Smart invited the presidents of the University of Chicago, University of Illinois, Lake Forest College, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University, and University of Wisconsin to a meeting in Chicago on January 11, 1895, to create policies aimed at regulating intercollegiate athletics. The eligibility of student-athletes was one of the main topics of discussion. The Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives was founded at a second meeting on February 8, 1896.

The strength of this league earned the Big East an automatic berth in the Bowl Championship Series, when that series was created in 1998. The Big East won two national football championships, both by University of Miami. Between 2005 and 2012, four of the more successful football schools left the Big East for other conferences, starting a process that led to a complete realignment of the Big East in 2013."

        "content": "Leirion Gaylor Baird is an American politician. Since the 2019 election, she has been the mayor of Lincoln, Nebraska, where she previously served as a city councilwoman.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nGaylor Baird grew up in Portland, Oregon; her parents were public school teachers. She completed a Bachelor of Arts in history from Yale College in 1993. She earned a Master of Science in comparative social policy from University of Oxford in 1997.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBaird began her career as a management consultant, working also as a city budget and policy analyst. She was the director of an after-school and summer program in San Francisco. Upon moving to Lincoln, Nebraska, she was appointed to the Lincoln/Lancaster County Planning Commission and helped develop its 2040 Comprehensive Plan. She was elected to the Lincoln City Council as a city-wide representative in May 2013 and was, at the time, its only female member. She won reelection in 2017.\nFollowing the ratification of a term limit amendment by referendum, Baird announced her intention to succeed incumbent three-term Mayor Chris Beutler. Affiliated with the Democratic Party, she officially ran as a nonpartisan candidate due to municipal election law. She won the election for mayor on May 7, 2019, against Republican-affiliated Cyndi Lamm. She was sworn in on May 20, 2019, alongside the new city council.\n\n\n== Political positions and mayoralty ==\nDuring her campaign for the mayoralty, Baird campaigned on additional road funding for the city, environmental preservation, and community land trusts for housing. During her time as a city councilwoman, she introduced legislation to ban bump stocks in the city.\nA recall against Baird was organized in October 2020. LNK Recall objected to the suspension of city charter rules that allowed Pat Lopez to be designated as health director. Organizers needed at least 21,652 signatures by December 23, 2020, to trigger a recall election; they were unable to do so. Baird responded by saying she continued to work as mayor.\nBaird was reelected in the 2023 mayoral election. Her two opponents in the primary were Republican state senator Suzanne Geist and Republican Stan Parker.\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n=== 2019 ===\n\n\n=== 2023 ===\n\n\n== References ==\nThe 2023 United States elections were held, in large part, on Tuesday, November 7, 2023. The off-year election included gubernatorial and state legislative elections in a few states, as well as numerous citizen initiatives, mayoral races, and a variety of other local offices on the ballot. At least three special elections to the United States Congress were scheduled as either deaths or vacancies arose. The Democratic Party retained control of the governorship in Kentucky, flipped the Wisconsin Supreme Court and held a seat on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, gained six seats in the New Jersey General Assembly, and won back unified control of the Virginia General Assembly, while Republicans also flipped the governorship in Louisiana and narrowly retained Mississippi's governorship. The election cycle also saw Ohio voting to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution and legalize cannabis for recreational use. The results were widely seen as a success for the Democratic Party.\nThe election cycle was generally marked by a trend of strong Democratic overperformances in special elections. Daily Kos and FiveThirtyEight analyses of at least 38 races in September 2023 determined that the party outperformed the partisan lean by an average of 10 percent. In comparison, Democrats outperformed by an average of 4 percent in elections held between the 2018 and 2020 elections, and an average of 7.6 percent in elections held in 2020. The 2023 overperformances consisted of unusually larger margins of victory in races held in safely Democratic areas and unusually smaller margins of defeat in races held in safely Republican areas. The results indicate a suburban shift among affluent, college-educated voters that started as an underlying reaction to Donald Trump's election in 2016. While the results were generally in line with predictions, Democrats still outperformed expectations despite the low approval ratings of incumbent Democratic president Joe Biden and polls indicating his middling prospects in the 2024 presidential election.\nBoth Democratic and Republican operatives attributed the Democrats' overperformance streak to general support of broad abortion rights in the wake of the Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision. This marked a continuing trend of bipartisan voter support for ballot initiatives on abortion rights since the June 2022 decision. Many conservative political analysts and commentators called a continued Republican alliance with the anti-abortion movement \"untenable\" and an \"electoral disaster\", and urged the party to favor abortion rights. Young voters in particular gave overwhelming support for abortion rights. Among voters between 18 and 29 years old in increasingly Republican Ohio, an estimated 77% voted for Ohio Issue 1, including a majority of Republicans. Exit polling indicated Ohioans believed abortion should be \"mostly legal\" by a margin of 61–36%.\n\n\n== Federal elections ==\n\n\n=== House of Representatives ===\n\nThree special elections were held in 2023 to fill vacancies during the 118th U.S. Congress.\n\nVirginia's 4th congressional district: Democrat Jennifer McClellan defeated Republican Leon Benjamin in the February special election, to succeed Donald McEachin  who died on November 28, 2022, of colorectal cancer.

This off-year election included gubernatorial elections in Kentucky, Louisiana, and Mississippi; regularly-scheduled state legislative elections in Louisiana, Mississippi, Virginia, and New Jersey; and special elections for seats in various state legislatures. Numerous citizen initiatives, mayoral races, and a variety of other local elections also occurred. Three special elections to the United States House of Representatives also took place in 2019 as a result of vacancies.\nDemocrats regained the governorship of Kentucky and held the office in Louisiana, despite strong campaign efforts by President Donald Trump for the Republican candidates. Democrats also took control of the state legislature in Virginia. Republicans held the governor's mansion in Mississippi and expanded their control of the Louisiana state legislature and gained seats in the New Jersey state legislature. A major theme in the election results was a suburban revolt against Trump and the Republican Party in general, as these areas swung heavily towards Democratic candidates in local, state, and federal elections.\n\n\n== Federal special elections ==\n\nThree special elections were held in 2019 to fill vacancies during the 116th United States Congress:\n\nPennsylvania's 12th congressional district: Republican Tom Marino resigned on January 23, 2019, to take a private sector job.

Jones Jr. died on February 10, 2019. The district has a partisan index of R+12. Republican state Rep. Greg Murphy was elected, defeating Democrat Allen M. Thomas and Libertarian Tim Harris.\nNorth Carolina's 9th congressional district: Due to allegations of election fraud, the results for the 9th congressional district were not certified for the 2018 election, leaving the seat vacant once the 116th Congress began (the seat was previously held by Republican Robert Pittenger, who lost his party's nomination in 2018). On February 21, 2019, the North Carolina State Board of Elections voted unanimously to hold a new election. The district has a partisan index of R+8. Republican state Sen. Dan Bishop was narrowly elected, defeating Democrat Dan McCready, Libertarian Jeff Scott, and Green Loran Allen Smith.\nAdditional vacancies occurred in Wisconsin's 7th Congressional district following the resignation of Republican Sean Duffy in September 2019; New York's 27th Congressional district following the October 2019 resignation of Republican Chris Collins ahead of his pleading guilty to insider trading; California's 25th Congressional district following the resignation of Democrat Katie Hill in November 2019; and Maryland's 7th Congressional district following the death of Democrat Elijah Cummings on October 17, 2019. Georgia Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson announced in August 2019 that he would resign on December 31, 2019, due to deteriorating health. Special elections to fill the seats occurred in 2020.\n\n\n=== Party switchers ===\nAlso during 2019, changes in partisan balance in the House of Representatives happened as the result of members of Congress switching their party affiliation. On July 4, 2019, Rep. Justin Amash declared he would leave the Republican Party but continue to serve in Congress as an independent, turning an evenly split Michigan delegation into a Democratic majority delegation. Following a week of speculation, on December 19, the day after voting against the impeachment of Donald Trump, Rep.

A member of the Democratic Party, she previously served on the Phoenix City Council from 2014 to 2018.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn Katharine Sarah Widland, Gallego grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Her parents are attorneys who moved to Albuquerque from Chicago after the 1979 Chicago blizzard. She grew up with asthma, which made air quality important to her. Gallego is Jewish, celebrating her bat mitzvah in Albuquerque.\nGallego graduated from Albuquerque Academy, where she served as student body vice president. She earned a bachelor's degree in environmental science and public policy from Harvard College and a Master of Business Administration from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nGallego worked for the Arizona Democratic Party, the Arizona Office of Tourism, as well as on economic development and strategic planning for the Salt River Project.  On November 5, 2013, Gallego was elected to the Phoenix City Council for the 8th district; she was reelected in 2017. With Greg Stanton, the Mayor of Phoenix, running for the United States House of Representatives in the 2018 elections, Gallego announced she would run in a special election to succeed him. She resigned from the city council effective August 7, 2018.\n\n\n=== Elections ===\nThe city of Phoenix has nonpartisan mayoral elections. In the 2018 special election, Kate Gallego and Daniel Valenzuela advanced to a runoff in November 2018. They defeated Moses Sanchez and Nicholas Sarwark. Although the election was nonpartisan, both candidates were Democrats. Previously on the city council, they had voted similarly. Kate Gallego defeated Daniel Valenzuela in the special general runoff election for the mayor of Phoenix in 2019. She received 58.6% of votes. She assumed office on March 21, 2019. She is only the second female mayor in Phoenix history and one of the youngest big city mayors in the United States. She was backed by progressives, labor unions, the Arizona Republic editorial board, and liberal advocacy organizations. Examples of these include Emily's List, Sierra Club, and the Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona.\nIn 2020, Kate Gallego ran for re-election. In November 2020, she was returned to office with the highest number of votes ever cast in a mayoral election. Merissa Hamilton, a Libertarian write in candidate, was Gallego's closest opponent. Hamilton received 26.29% of votes. Gallego won the election receiving 60.7% of the votes. In March 2024, Gallego announced her intention to run for re-election for another term.\n\n\n=== Climate change ===\nDuring Gallego's tenure as mayor, Phoenix has taken steps to counter the urban heat island effects which are aggravated by climate change. Increasing temperatures in the Phoenix area are projected to cost billions of dollars per year. Among the steps being taken are the creation of \"cool corridors\" through the planting of desert-adapted trees, and the use of lighter-colored sidewalks and streets, particularly in areas with high pedestrian traffic and little shade. Where to plant the trees is determined in part based on \"tree equity.\" The city uses an interactive tool from the nonprofit American Forests that grades shade in neighborhoods based on satellite images. Phoenix has also opened one of the first city heat mitigation offices in the United States. It will support climate mitigation in Phoenix and share strategies with individuals and cities worldwide.\n\n\n=== Policing ===\nThe police department of Phoenix recorded shooting 44 people in 2018, spurring a reassessment from the community on police accountability. In 2020, Gallego suggested a plan for a citizens review board that would balance the police department interests and community interests.

The daughter of Taiwanese immigrants, she was the first Asian American woman to serve on the Boston City Council, from 2014 to 2021, and acted as its president from 2016–2018. She is the first woman and first non-white person to have been elected mayor of Boston. At 36 years of age, she was also the youngest individual to have been elected to the position in nearly a century. Wu is a member of the Democratic Party.\nWhile on the Boston City Council, Wu authored several ordinances that were enacted. This included an ordinance to prevent the city from contracting with health insurers that discriminate in their coverage against transgender individuals. She also authored ordinances to have the city protect wetlands, support adaption to climate change, enact a plastic bag ban, adopt Community Choice Aggregation, and provide paid parental leave to municipal employees. As a city councilor, Wu also partook in a successful effort to adopt regulations on short-term rentals.\nDuring her mayoralty, Wu has advocated for a municipal \"Green New Deal\" (the Boston Green New Deal) and signed an ordinance to divest city investments from companies that derive more than 15 percent of their revenue from fossil fuels, tobacco products, or prison facilities. She also has announced plans for the city to spend $2 billion on school construction projects as part of a \"Green New Deal\" for the city's public schools. As mayor, she has also taken actions related to increasing affordable housing in the city and taken actions related to the city's COVID-19 policies. A supporter of fare-free public transportation, Wu has funded a pilot program of fare-free service on three MBTA bus routes, expanding on a single-route pilot program that had previously been started under Kim Janey's preceding acting mayoralty. She also reached a contract agreement with the Boston Police Patrolmen's Association that secured the union's agreement to significant reforms within the Boston Police Department.\nWu is considered a political progressive and a protégé of Elizabeth Warren. Warren was one of Wu's professors in law school, and Wu worked on Warren's 2012 United States Senate campaign.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMichelle Wu was born on January 14, 1985, in the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, to Taiwanese American parents of waishengren origin, meaning their parents had left mainland China during the KMT retreat to Taiwan. Her maternal grandfather was a general in the KMT Army. Her father, Han Wu, was admitted to the Illinois Institute of Technology for graduate studies; however, neither he nor his wife spoke much English. Raised with Mandarin Chinese as a first language,  Wu often interpreted between English and Mandarin for her parents. Her parents later were divorced.\nOne of four children, Wu graduated from Barrington High School in 2003 as the valedictorian of her class.

In 2006, Watson was elected to the Texas Senate from District 14.\nIn 2011, Watson was chosen by his Democratic colleagues to chair the Senate Democratic Caucus and served until 2015. On the first day of the 86th Texas Legislature, he was chosen by his colleagues—Democrats and Republicans—to serve as president pro tempore. The position typically goes to the most senior member, regardless of party, who has not yet served as president pro tem, and is second in line of succession to the Governor.\nIt was announced by the Austin American-Statesman that Watson had planned to resign from the Texas Senate to become the first dean of the University of Houston's Hobby School of Public Affairs. His resignation was effective April 30, 2020. With incumbent Mayor Steve Adler not seeking another term, Watson entered the race to become Austin mayor for a second time.

During his tenure, he worked to merge the agency with the Texas Air Control Board and the Texas Water Commission to form the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission, and oversaw implementation of the 1991 amendments to the federal Clean Air Act.\nIn 1994, he was named the Outstanding Young Lawyer of Texas. In 1997, Watson co-founded the Austin law firm of Watson Bishop London & Galow, creating a broad law practice that represented families, doctors, small businesses, and some of the state's major universities.\n\n\n== First term as Mayor of Austin (1997–2001) ==\nIn 1997, after Watson moved from Rollingwood to Austin, he was elected as the 54th mayor of Austin, a nonpartisan position. He ran on a pledge to build consensus in a city that was then dominated by political battles between environmentalists and developers. He campaigned to raise more than $78 million for land preservation and $300 million for transportation improvements. Watson's signature accomplishments as mayor included the transformation of Downtown Austin into a \"24-hour downtown\" by encouraging development of housing and retail in place of vacant warehouses and parking lots, partially through tax incentives and the city's Smart Growth initiatives.\nIn 1999, Watson spearheaded a redevelopment project along several blocks of waterfront property in Downtown Austin, in an effort to create a new public-private \"digital district\" in place of dilapidated warehouses and businesses including the former Liberty Lunch, which were demolished.

Upon taking office as Salt Lake City’s 36th mayor, Mendenhall became the city’s third and youngest woman in the role (after Deedee Corradini and Jackie Biskupski). Prior to assuming office, Mendenhall represented the city’s 5th district on the Salt Lake City Council.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMendenhall was born in Arizona and moved to Sandy, Utah, when she was seven. Her father, Don, died from Hodgkin lymphoma when she was 14. She graduated from the University of Utah with a Bachelor of Arts degree in gender studies and a certificate in Non Profit Leadership and Management. In 2019, she earned a Master of Science degree in science and technology from the University of Utah.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nAfter college, Mendenhall conducted air-quality testing and internal auditing at Sterigenics, which sterilizes medical equipment.\nShe first entered politics as an air-quality activist with Utah Moms for Clean Air, but in 2010 moved on to co-found the non-profit Breathe Utah because \"she quickly realized she could more effectively fight for changes as someone sitting at the decision-making table rather than protesting outside the door.\"\n\n\n== City Council (2014–2020) ==\nMendenhall was elected to the Salt Lake City Council in November 2013 to represent District 5, which includes the Ballpark, Liberty Wells, Central 9th, and East Liberty Park neighborhoods. She took office in January 2014 and improving air quality became her signature issue. In May 2014, Mendenhall was appointed to the Utah Air Quality Board, which is the \"primary air quality policy maker for the State of Utah.\"\nIn 2015, Mendenhall and the City Council voted unanimously to cut campaign-finance limits, reducing the maximum contribution to a mayoral election from $7,500 to $3,500, and the maximum contribution to a City Council candidate from $1,600 to $750.\nIn July 2017, Mendenhall led on the passage of an ordinance to crack down on \"businesses that are hotbeds of crime.\" The ordinance was designed to close a loophole that led to stop motels and hotels on State Street allowing sex work and drug dealing without legal consequence. \"We are drawing a line in the sand,\" Mendenhall said.\nIn 2017, Mendenhall was re-elected to the City Council with 84% of the vote.\nIn November 2017, Mendenhall led the Salt Lake City Council to unanimously approve an ordnance limiting the capacity of homeless shelters to 200.\nIn March 2018, the Utah Legislature passed a bill that cut Salt Lake City out of the process of developing an inland port in the city’s Northwest Quadrant. The legislation also took 100% of the tax revenue generated from the Inland Port while denying the city’s mayor a seat on the Inland Port Authority and forcing the city to pay for police and fire department coverage of the area.\nIn July 2018, Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski withdrew from negotiations with the state government over the port project.  With the state moving the Port project forward without the city’s input, Mendenhall re-opened negotiations in her capacity as chair of the City Council.\nBased on those negotiations, on July 18, 2018, the Legislature passed additional legislation that required 10% of tax revenue generated by the inland port to be invested in affordable housing in Salt Lake City. The bill also required the Port to pay the city for its share of taxes needed to cover the cost of city services including police and fire. In an editorial, the Salt Lake Tribune called the bill \"a great improvement over what sits on the books.\"\n\n\n== 2019 mayoral campaign ==\n\nMendenhall was the last of nine candidates to declare her candidacy for mayor, doing so on March 24, 2019, citing her \"hands-on\" experience.\nMendenhall officially launched her campaign on April 14, 2019 outside an air-quality monitoring station at the Salt Lake Center for Science Education, a STEM\nThis is a list of notable sub-national officials that endorsed the Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign.\n\n\n== Statewide officials ==\n\n\n=== Governors ===\n\n\n==== Current ====\n\nAll 23 incumbent Democratic state governors — including the vice presidential nominee Tim Walz of Minnesota — have endorsed Harris, as well as 3 of the 4 Democratic territorial governors and one Republican governor.\n\n\n==== Former ====\n\n\n=== Lieutenant governors ===\n\n\n==== Current ====\n19 of the 23 incumbent state and territorial Democratic lieutenant governors have endorsed Harris.\n\n\n==== Former ====\n\nMandela Barnes, Wisconsin (2019–2023)\nGeoff Duncan, Georgia (2019–2023) (Republican)\nMichael Steele, Maryland (2003–2007), Chair of the RNC (2009–2011) (Republican)\nKathleen Kennedy Townsend, Maryland (1995–2003)\nFran Ulmer, Alaska (1994–2002)\n\n\n=== Attorneys general ===\n\n\n==== Current ====\n22 of the 25 incumbent state and territorial Democratic attorney generals have endorsed Harris.\n\n\n==== Former ====\nBruce Botelho, Alaska Attorney General (1994–2002), mayor of Juneau, Alaska (1988–1991, 2003–2012)\nKaren Freeman-Wilson, Attorney General of Indiana (2000–2001), mayor of Gary, Indiana (2012–2019)\nTerry Goddard, Arizona Attorney General (2003–2011), mayor of Phoenix, Arizona (1984–1990)\nLisa Madigan, Illinois Attorney General (2003–2019)\nThomas D.

In the summer of 2018, several prominent Republican politicians successfully led a petition drive for an amendment to the city charter that would limit the Lincoln mayor to serving three consecutive terms. The amendment would apply retroactively, thereby prohibiting Beutler from running for a fourth term in the 2019 municipal election.\n\n\n== Primary ==\nThe primary was held on April 9.\n\n\n== General election ==\n\n\n== References ==\nChokwe Antar Lumumba (born March 29, 1983) is an American attorney, activist, and politician serving as the 53rd mayor of Jackson, Mississippi, the 7th consecutive African-American to hold the position.\nHe was first elected in 2017. In the primary election, Lumumba soundly won the Democratic nomination, defeating both incumbent mayor Tony Yarber and State Senator John Horhn. Lumumba went on to win the general election in a landslide. He is a self-described progressive and socialist. Lumumba has also referred to himself as a political revolutionary.\nHe is the son of former mayor and Black nationalist activist Chokwe Lumumba, who served briefly as mayor of Jackson before his death in 2014.\n\n\n== Mayor of Jackson, Mississippi ==\nLumumba was elected mayor in June 2017 with 93% of the vote. The Nation commented that \"Lumumba lit up the left press with his promise—delivered later that month in a speech at the People's Summit in Chicago—to make Jackson 'the most radical city on the planet.'\"\nIn summer 2018, Lumumba attended Michael Bloomberg's \"Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative.\" The City of Jackson noted that the Initiative was created by Bloomberg to train leaders to \"manage the complexities of running a city, and to have opportunities to learn from one another.\" Four months later, in November 2018, Bloomberg gave the City of Jackson $1 million to create art spotlighting food insecurity.

He described the proposed plan as disingenuous and disrespectful. A city investigation discovered that the Jackson Zoological Society had mismanaged funds and failed to pay $6 million in water bills.\nLumumba took direct control of the zoo and approved $200,000 to renovate it. The zoo reopened in August 2020 under city control.\n\n\n=== Jackson water crisis ===\nIn 2019, over 3 billion U.S. gallons (11 gigaliters) of raw sewage was released into the Pearl River, leading to the local government telling residents to avoid contact with the water by swimming or fishing.\nIn 2020, following a record-breaking amount of rain during the early months of the year, the city's sewage system once again overflowed and led to 1⁄2 billion U.S. gallons (1.9 gigaliters) of raw sewage, as well as 5.7 billion U.S. gallons (22 gigaliters) of treated sewage, being dumped into the Pearl River.\nIn March 2021, Lumumba wrote to Mississippi state governor Tate Reeves requesting $47M in aid needed to make the urgently needed repairs and updates to the water infrastructure system in Jackson.\nIn August 2022, Lumumba declared a water system emergency following the failure of the largest water treatment plant in Jackson. The crisis was caused by decades of mishandled and out-of-date water and waste infrastructure that led to at least 2,300 U.S. gallons (8,700 liters) of sewage overflowing into the Pearl River. Overflowing water from the Ross Barnett Reservoir and the Pearl River caused the water treatment plant in Jackson to completely fail. With the system down, many of the 153,000 residents of Jackson were left without clean drinking water, or with poor water pressure.\nOn January 6, 2023, Lumumba announced that they had secured the funding needed to begin repairing and reconstructing the water systems in Jackson. Nearly $800 million in funding was pulled from the $1.7 trillion federal omnibus bill that was passed back in late 2022.

Immediately after getting his degree, the position at BP-Amoco became full-time. In 1999, Dickens was employed at DSM Engineering and Plastics where he was a sales engineer. As a sales engineer, his contribution to the company were recognized as he was named the first Black salesman of the year. After his time spent as a sales engineer at twenty-eight years old Dickens alongside his older sister co-founded City-Living Home Furnishing. The furnishing company was around for nine years from 2002 to 2011 and became a multi-million dollar business in only two locations. Unfortunately due to the housing crisis Dickens was unable to keep the company alive and in 2010 he filed for Chapter Seven bankruptcy.\nIn 2013 Andre Dickens, was elected as an at-large City Council member. From 2014 to 2021 he mainly advocated for the improvement of Atlanta's public safety, the need for affordable housing, having programs for citizens, and creating more opportunities to students in Atlanta's Public School system. One of his most important contributions to the city while on city council was his sponsorship of legislation that made the minimum wage for city employees fifteen dollars an hour. In addition to changing the minimum wage he created the Department of Transportation, the BeltLine Inclusionary Zoning which increased affordable housing in the area, and the Atlanta Youth Commission.\n\n\n== Mayor of Atlanta (2022-present) ==\n\nOn February 25, 2022, Dickens lifted the indoor COVID-19 mask mandate in Atlanta, ending a near 2 year restriction on restaurants, hotels, and other venues.\nDuring his first year in office, Mayor Andre Dickens made one of Atlanta's largest-ever, single-housing investments, committing more than $100 million to new and updated housing. The Dickens administration continues to partner with and leverage tools such as inclusionary zoning to assist with this investment. In order to offer affordable housing alongside increasing \nLincoln is the capital of the U.S. state of Nebraska and the county seat of Lancaster County. The city covers 100.4 square miles (260.035 km2) and had an estimated population of 294,757 in 2023. It is the state's second-most populous city and the 71st-largest in the United States. Lincoln is the economic and cultural anchor of the Lincoln Metropolitan and Lincoln-Beatrice Combined Statistical Areas, home to 361,921 people.\nLincoln was founded in 1856 as the village of Lancaster on the wild salt marshes and arroyos of what became Lancaster County. Renamed after President Abraham Lincoln, it became Nebraska's state capital in 1869. The Bertram G. Goodhue–designed state capitol building was completed in 1932, and is the nation's second-tallest capitol. As the city is the seat of government for the state of Nebraska, the state and the U.S. government are major employers. The University of Nebraska was founded in Lincoln in 1869. The university is Nebraska's largest, with 26,079 students enrolled, and the city's third-largest employer. Other primary employers fall into the service and manufacturing industries, including a growing high-tech sector. The region makes up a part of what is known as the Midwest Silicon Prairie.\nDesignated as a \"refugee-friendly\" city by the U.S. Department of State in the 1970s, the city was the 12th-largest resettlement site per capita in the country by 2000. Refugee Vietnamese, Karen (Burmese ethnic minority), Sudanese and Yazidi (Iraqi ethnic minority) people, as well as refugees from Iraq, the Middle East and Afghanistan, have resettled in the city. During the 2018–19 school year, Lincoln Public Schools provided support for about 3,000 students from 150 countries, who spoke 125 different languages.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Natives ===\nBefore the expansion westward of settlers, the prairie was covered with buffalo grass. Plains Indians, descendants of indigenous peoples who occupied the area for thousands of years, lived in and hunted along Salt Creek. The Pawnee, which included four tribes, lived in villages along the Platte River. The Great Sioux Nation, including the Ihanktowan-Ihanktowana and the Lakota, to the north and west, used Nebraska as a hunting and skirmish ground, but did not have any long-term settlements in the state. An occasional buffalo could still be seen in the plat of Lincoln in the 1860s.\n\n\n=== Founding ===\n\nLincoln was founded in 1856 as the village of Lancaster and became the county seat of the newly created Lancaster County in 1859. The village was sited on the east bank of Salt Creek. The first settlers were attracted to the area due to the abundance of salt. Once J. Sterling Morton developed his salt mines in Kansas, salt in the village was no longer a viable commodity. Captain W. T. Donovan, a former steamer captain, and his family settled on Salt Creek in 1856. In 1859, the village settlers met to form a county. A caucus was formed and the committee, which included Donovan, selected Lancaster as the county seat. The county was named Lancaster. After the passage of the 1862 Homestead Act, homesteaders began to inhabit the area. The first plat was dated August 6, 1864.\nBy the end of 1868, Lancaster had a population of approximately 500. The township of Lancaster was renamed Lincoln, with the incorporation of the city of Lincoln on April 1, 1869. In 1869, the University of Nebraska was established in Lincoln by the state with a land grant of about 130,000 acres. Construction of University Hall, the first building, began the same year.\n\n\n=== State capital ===\n\nNebraska was granted statehood on March 1, 1867. The capital of the Nebraska Territory had been Omaha since the creation of the territory in 1854. Most of its population lived south of the Platte River. After much of the territory south of the Platte was considered annexation to Kansas, the territorial legislature voted to place the capital south of the river and as far west as possible. Before the vote to remove the capit\nBrett P. Smiley (born 1978 or 1979) is an American politician from Rhode Island. A member of the Democratic Party, he is the mayor of Providence, Rhode Island.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nSmiley grew up outside of Chicago, Illinois. He attended DePaul University, earning a bachelor's degree and a Master of Business Administration. In 2004, he was campaign manager for congressional candidate Melissa Bean. He moved to Rhode Island to work for Lieutenant Governor Charlie Fogarty's campaign in the 2006 Rhode Island gubernatorial election. After the election, Smiley worked for David Cicilline, the mayor of Providence, and opened a political consulting firm.\nIn December 2013, Smiley announced his candidacy for mayor of Providence in the 2014 election, seeking to succeed Angel Taveras, who did not run for reelection so that he could run for governor of Rhode Island. He dropped out of the mayoral race in August 2014 and endorsed Jorge Elorza, the eventual winner. Elorza named Smiley the city's chief operating officer after the election. In September 2016, he became the chief of staff to Governor Gina Raimondo. In December 2019, Raimondo named Smiley as the new head of the Rhode Island Department of Administration. He resigned in February 2021.\n\n\n== Mayor of Providence ==\nAfter his resignation, Smiley announced his candidacy for mayor of Providence in the 2022 election, seeking to succeed Jorge Elorza, who was prevented from running for a third term due to term limits. He won the Democratic primary in September 2022 with 42% of the vote, while Gonzalo Cuervo received 36% and Nirva LaFortune earned 22%. He faced no opposition in the November 8 general election and took the oath of office on January 2, 2023.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSmiley's husband, Jim DeRentis, is a real estate agent.\n\n\n== References ==\nLauren Stein McLean (born October 20, 1974) is an American politician and entrepreneur serving as the mayor of Boise, Idaho. McLean served as a member of the Boise City Council from 2011 to 2019, and as council president from 2017 to 2019, before defeating four term incumbent Mayor Dave Bieter in the 2019 mayoral election.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMcLean was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and raised in Houston, Texas, and Cazenovia, New York. McLean received her Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Notre Dame in 1997 and a Master of Public Administration in environmental policy from Boise State University in 2001.\n\n\n== Personal Life ==\nMcLean and her husband Scott have two children.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMcLean serves on the board of governors of the Andrus Center for Public Policy at Boise State University. She is also a member of the Boise City Planning and Zoning Association and Boise Parks Commission.\n\n\n=== Mayor ===\n\n\n==== 2019 election ====\nMcLean was a candidate in the 2019 Boise mayoral election, running against incumbent Dave Bieter, former mayor H. Brent Coles, and others. Since neither Bieter nor McLean had surpassed the 50 percent vote threshold required to claim victory, the two competed in a runoff election held on December 3, 2019. McLean won with 65.5 percent of the vote to Bieter's 34.5 percent. The mayor's office is a nonpartisan position, though McLean is a registered Democrat.\nMcLean is the first woman elected to the office, and the second to serve as Boise mayor after Carolyn Terteling-Payne, who served briefly on an interim basis from 2003 to 2004. McLean was inaugurated on January 7, 2020.\n\n\n==== Tenure ====\nOn July 1, 2020, McLean presided over the swearing-in of Boise's new police chief, Ryan Lee, who had been confirmed to the position by the Boise City Council. The ceremony took place the day following a Boise Black Lives Matter rally. McLean does not support defunding the police to divert funds to social services. In response to a question about her position, she stated that \"We have to have a safe city if we’re going to have a city where everyone can thrive. I’m in full support of our police department.\" McLean has stated that she supports increasing funding for social services while maintaining funding for the police department.\nMcLean announced in March 2020 that April rents in city-owned public housing would be forgiven, and that during the same period the city would place a moratorium on evictions from public rental housing.\nIn November 2020, in response to rising numbers of COVID-19 cases and occupied hospital beds, McLean issued a mask mandate and closed public facilities. In response to the mask mandate, there were protests outside McLean's residence, in addition to a mask-burning ceremony. The city of Boise announced in January 2021 that public facilities would expand services beginning on February 1, 2021. McLean noted that \"We have seen a steady hold in cases the last couple weeks and our city is here to serve the public.\"\nMcLean announced Idaho's votes in the roll call at the 2020 Democratic National Convention where she also promoted the city's efforts to combat global warming. Due to Idaho's rising population, McLean has worked with city developers to build affordable housing.\n\n\n==== 2023 election ====\nMcLean was the incumbent candidate. Former police chief Mike Masterson ran in 2023 along with Joe Evans who received 0.9 percent of the vote and Aaron Reis who received 0.3 percent of the vote. McLean won with 55.4 percent of the vote, and Masterson with 43%.  This election year had 43.8 percent turnout of registered Boise voters.

A member of the Democratic Party, he won the 2023 Denver mayoral election, defeating Kelly Brough in the June 6 runoff election.\nJohnston first entered politics when he served in the Colorado Senate, representing the 33rd district from 2009 to 2017. He was a candidate for governor of Colorado in 2018, losing in the primary to Jared Polis, who went on to win the general election. He was also a candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2020, before withdrawing from the race in September 2019.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nOne of four children, Johnston was born in Oklahoma City and raised in Vail, Colorado, the son of Sarah \"Sally\" (née Cox) and Paul Ross Johnston. His father was a U.S. Army veteran and businessman who served on the town council for more than a decade and then as mayor from 1983 to 1987.\nAfter graduating from Vail Mountain School in 1993, Johnston attended Yale College, earning his bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1997. During high school and college, he was involved in community service activities, including volunteering at a Denver homeless shelter and mentoring youth in a New Haven housing project. After graduating from college, he taught English at Greenville High School in rural Mississippi for two years as part of the Teach For America program. Based on this experience, he wrote the book In the Deep Heart's Core.\nAfter his program ended, Johnston enrolled in the Harvard Graduate School of Education, earning a master's degree in education policy. While at Harvard, he worked with Al Gore's education advisor, Jon Schnur. With Schnur and others, he helped to found New Leaders for New Schools, an organization dedicated to training and recruiting leaders for urban schools. Upon earning his master's degree, he enrolled in Yale Law School, and became an education policy advisor to political candidates, including U.S. Senate candidate Tom Strickland in 2002.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nAfter returning to Colorado in 2003, he was hired as principal at Joan Farley Academy.

As the school's principal, he helped to develop the school's curriculum and program as the school district shifted to developing smaller schools.\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Johnston helped lead an education summit in New Orleans and worked with U.S. Congressman George Miller on legislation to recruit and retain teachers. He joined Senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign as an informal advisor early in 2007; by May 2008, he was regarded as one of the campaign's key advisors on education issues. Obama delivered a major address on education from MESA in May 2008.  The school's achievements were highlighted in an October 2008 campaign advertisement.\nJohnston has served on the boards of local and national education and service organizations, including the I Have A Dream Foundation, the Urban League, City Year, New Leaders, America Achieves, and America Succeeds. In 2010, he was featured in Forbes magazine's \"7 Most Powerful Educators\" and Time magazine's \"40 Under 40\".\nJohnston served as the chief executive officer of Gary Community Ventures during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A member of the Democratic Party, she is the mayor of Raleigh, North Carolina, serving since 2019, and previously served on the Raleigh City Council from 2007 to 2017.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBaldwin grew up in Rhode Island and graduated from the University of Rhode Island. She is married to Jim Baldwin and she has two children, a daughter and son-in-law.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Baldwin communications ===\nPrior to political service, she worked in the marketing field, including working as marketing director for several firms and managing her own consulting firm, Baldwin Communications.\n\n\n=== City council service ===\n\nShe served on the Raleigh City Council for ten years, from 2007 through 2017 during the mayoral terms of Charles Meeker and Nancy McFarlane. While on the city council, she served as chair of the Law & Public Safety Committee and the Transportation Committee, and served on several other committees, as well as acting as the city's representative to GoTriangle, a regional transportation authority.  When Meeker decided to step down prior to the 2011 election, he approached both Baldwin and McFarlane to run for mayor in his stead, Baldwin however declined the offer to run, as she was dealing with personal issues, she felt would interfere with her ability to effectively campaign and serve in the role as mayor.\n\n\n=== Mayoral tenure ===\nOn March 27, 2019, Baldwin announced that she would be running for mayor of Raleigh in the 2019 election to succeed McFarlane, who was stepping down as mayor in the midst of health troubles. Baldwin came in first place, winning 38% of the vote. A runoff was not requested by Charles Francis, the runner-up, and so Baldwin became mayor of Raleigh. She assumed office December 2, 2019. Baldwin ran for reelection in 2022, defeating DaQuanta Copeland and Terrance Ruth. On April 16, 2024, Baldwin announced that she would not seek reelection.\n\n\n==== Response to COVID-19 ====\nBaldwin was mayor while the COVID-19 pandemic impacted Raleigh. On June 17, 2020, she made a proclamation that mandated masks. Baldwin made a second mask mandate on August 13, 2021, due to the rise in the Delta variant that she later terminated on February 18, 2022. Mayor Baldwin tested positive for COVID-19 on April 18, 2022.\n\n\n==== Response to George Floyd Protests ====\nBaldwin was mayor during the George Floyd protests in Raleigh. In the midst of rioting she declared a citywide curfew. Her response was criticized in the following weeks.\n\n\n==== Tax Increment Grant (TIG) and Property Tax Increase ====\nOn May 4, 2021, Raleigh City Council approved a tax increment grant (TIG) policy which Mayor Baldwin voted in favor of. Mayor Baldwin received campaign contributions from developer John Kane, who may benefit from the TIG. The TIG policy allows the city of Raleigh to provide up to $5 million per year (2% of the annual budget) in tax rebates to private developers, effectively shielding them from increases in property taxes due to rising property values. A month later on June 1, 2021, Raleigh City Council passed an annual budget that included an increase in property taxes generating an increased $7 million per year which was supported by Mayor Baldwin.\n\n\n==== Gun violence ====\nBaldwin responded after the 2022 Raleigh shootings killed five people, including a law enforcement employee.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mayors of the 50 largest cities in the United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nProfile at Vote Smart\nBio page City of Raleigh website.\nFrank D.

Scott accepted a position as a community banker with First Security Bank, while continuing to devote significant time to serving both his city and state as a member of the Port of Little Rock Board of Directors and as a member of the Arkansas Highway Commission.\nIn the 2018 election, Scott ran for mayor of Little Rock. In the November 6 nonpartisan election, he led a five-candidate field with 37.11% of the vote, falling short of the 40% required to avoid a runoff election. Scott and Baker Kurrus advanced to a December 4 runoff, where Scott defeated Kurrus. Scott is the first elected African American mayor of Little Rock.\nScott was sworn in on January 1, 2019. In his first term, Scott proposed the \"Rebuild the Rock\" initiative, to be supported by a new sales tax to replace an expiring one. The initiative is meant to fund improvement of infrastructure and public parks, a senior center, sports complex, and upgrade technology and equipment used by first responders. The measure was defeated in a referendum in September 2021. Scott continues to push for a new sales tax and a date for a new referendum has been set for November 2024.\nScott ran for reelection in the 2022 election. He defeated local businessman Steve Landers, Sr, with 50% of the vote.\nOn April 21, 2023, the Arkansas Ethics Commission voted 4-1 that Scott was in violation of the law for not reimbursing the city when he used his city-owned vehicle to travel to and from campaign events in his 2022 re-election campaign.

        "content": "Most presidents of the United States received a college education, even most of the earliest. Of the first seven presidents, five were college graduates. College degrees have set the presidents apart from the general population, and presidents have held degrees even though it was quite rare and unnecessary for practicing most occupations, including law. Of the 45 individuals to have been the president, 24 graduated from a private undergraduate college, 9 graduated from a public undergraduate college, and 12 held no degree.  Every president since 1953 has had a bachelor's degree, reflecting the increasing importance of higher education in the United States.\n\n\n== List by university attended ==\n\n\n=== Did not graduate from college ===\nGeorge Washington (The death of Washington's father ended his formal schooling. The College of William & Mary issued surveying licenses in Virginia, and Washington received his license from the College in 1749 — surveyors did not attend classes at the school. Washington believed strongly in formal education, and his will left money and/or stocks to support three educational institutions, including George Washington University and Washington and Lee University)\nJames Monroe (attended the College of William and Mary, but dropped out to fight in the Revolutionary War)\nAndrew Jackson\nMartin Van Buren\nWilliam Henry Harrison (attended Hampden Sydney College for three years but did not graduate and then attended University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine but never received a degree)\nZachary Taylor\nMillard Fillmore (founded the University at Buffalo)\nAbraham Lincoln (had only about a year of formal schooling of any kind)\nAndrew Johnson  (no formal schooling of any kind)\nGrover Cleveland\nWilliam McKinley (attended Allegheny College, but did not graduate; also attended Albany Law School, but also did not graduate)\nHarry S. Truman (went to business college and law school, but did not graduate)\n\n\n=== Undergraduate ===\n\n\n==== Additional undergraduate information ====\nSome presidents attended more than one institution. George Washington never attended college, though The College of William & Mary did issue him a surveyor's certificate. One president attended a foreign college at the undergraduate level: John Quincy Adams at Leiden University (John F. Kennedy intended to study at the London School of Economics, but failed to attend as he fell ill before classes began.) Bill Clinton won a Rhodes Scholarship, enrolling at the University of Oxford in Fall 1968, where he read for a B.Phil in politics. He left Oxford without earning a degree in order to enroll at Yale Law School.   \nThree presidents have attended the United States Service academies: Ulysses S. Grant and Dwight D. Eisenhower graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, while Jimmy Carter graduated from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. No presidents have graduated from the United States Coast Guard Academy or the much newer U.S. Air Force Academy.  Eisenhower also graduated from the Army Command and General Staff College, Army Industrial College and Army War College. These were not degree-granting institutions when Eisenhower attended, but were part of his professional education as a career soldier.\n\n\n=== Graduate school ===\nA total of 20 presidents attended some form of graduate school (including professional schools). Among them, eleven presidents received a graduate degree during their lifetimes; two more received graduate degrees posthumously.\n\n\n==== Business school ====\n\n\n==== Graduate school ====\n\n\n==== Medical school ====\n\n\n==== Law school ====\n\nSeveral presidents who were lawyers did not attend law school, but became lawyers after independent study under the tutelage of established attorneys. Some had attended college before beginning their legal studies, and several studied law without first having attended college.  Presidents who were lawyers but did not attend law school include: John Adams; Thomas\nMost vice presidents of the United States have undergone higher education at an American university, college or law school.\n\n\n== List ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of presidents of the United States by education\n\n\n== References ==\nReligious affiliations can affect the electability of the presidents of the United States and shape their stances on policy matters and their visions of society and also how they want to lead it. While no president has ever openly identified as an atheist, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and William Howard Taft were speculated to be atheists by their opponents during political campaigns; in addition, a survey during the presidency of Donald Trump showed that 63% of Americans did not believe he was religious, despite his professed Christian affiliation. Trump supporters have also circulated conspiracy theories that Barack Obama is a Muslim. Conversely, other presidents, such as Jimmy Carter, have used their faith as a defining aspect of their campaigns and tenure in office.\nEssentially all of the presidents can be characterized as Christians, at least by upbringing, though some were unaffiliated with any specific religious body. Mainline Protestants predominate, with Episcopalians and Presbyterians being the most prevalent. John F. Kennedy was the first Catholic president, and Joe Biden, the current president, is the second.\n\n\n== Formal affiliation ==\nThe pattern of religious adherence has changed dramatically over the course of United States history, so that the pattern of presidential affiliations is quite unrepresentative of modern membership numbers. For example, Episcopalians are extraordinarily well represented among the presidents compared to a current membership of about 2% of the population; this is partly because the Church of England, from which the Episcopal Church is derived, was the established church in some of the British Colonies (such as New York and Virginia) before the American Revolution. The Episcopal Church has been much larger previously, with its decline in membership occurring only in more recent decades. The first seven presidents listed as Episcopalians were all from Virginia. Unitarians are also overrepresented, reflecting the importance of those colonial churches. Conversely, Baptists are underrepresented, a reflection of their quite recent expansion in numbers; the list includes only two Catholic presidents including the current president, although they are currently the largest single denomination. There have been no Adventist, Anabaptist, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, Latter Day Saint, or Pentecostal presidents.\nWhile many presidents did not formally join a church until quite late in life, there is a genre of tales of deathbed conversions. Biographers usually doubt these, though the baptism of James K. Polk is well documented.\n\n\n== Personal beliefs ==\nOn the other hand, there are several presidents who considered themselves aligned with a particular church, but who withheld from formal affiliation for a time. James Buchanan, for instance, held himself allied with the Presbyterian church, but refrained from joining it until he left office.\n\n\n=== Deism and the Founding Fathers ===\nDeism was a religious philosophy in common currency in colonial times, and some Founding Fathers (most notably Thomas Paine, who was an explicit proponent of it, and Benjamin Franklin, who spoke of it in his Autobiography) are identified more or less with this system. Thomas Jefferson became a deist in later life, and George Washington, James Madison, James Monroe, and John Tyler are often identified as having some degree of deistic beliefs.\n\n\n=== Unitarianism and Nontrinitarianism ===\nFour presidents are affiliated with Unitarian churches (not to be confused with Unitarian Universalism), and a fifth (Jefferson) was an exponent of ideas now commonly associated with Unitarianism. Unitarians fall outside of Trinitarian Christianity, and the question arises as to the degree to which the presidents themselves held Christian precepts. The information is generally available in the statements of the presidents themselves; for example, John Quincy Adams left detailed statements of his beliefs. William Howard Taft, a Unitarian, \nThis is a complete list of Philippine presidents by college education that consists of the 17 heads of state in the history of the Philippines. \nAlmost all presidents (except Emilio Aguinaldo, Joseph Estrada, and Bongbong Marcos) completed a college degree program. College and postgraduate education have prepared presidents in their future roles as heads of state, architects of foreign policy, commanders-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and managers of the entire government bureaucracy. \nBy law, under the Constitution of the Philippines, any Filipino citizen aged forty and above who can read and write and can meet residency requirements is eligible to run as president. However, in practice, popularity, political machinery, and financial resources are the key elements leading to a successful presidential candidate.\n\n\n== List by degree ==\nThis section lists presidents according to schools from which they earned degrees. Schools that presidents attended but did not earn degrees from are not included.\n\n\n=== Did not graduate from college ===\nEmilio Aguinaldo (A cholera epidemic forced the Colegio de San Juan de Letran where Aguinaldo attended the equivalent of high school to close in 1880. Aguinaldo never returned to any form of schooling following this closure.)\nJoseph Estrada (Estrada attended Mapúa Institute of Technology before transferring to Polytechnic Colleges of the Philippines, where he later dropped out.)\nBongbong Marcos (Marcos attended the Center for Research and Communication, where he took a special diploma course in economics, but did not finish. He also attended St Edmund Hall at the University of Oxford, studying philosophy, politics and economics (PPE). However, despite his claims that he graduated with a bachelor of arts in PPE, he did not obtain such a degree. Marcos had passed philosophy, but failed economics, and failed politics twice, thus making him ineligible for a degree. Instead, he received a special diploma in social studies, which was awarded mainly to non-graduates and is currently no longer offered by the university.)\n\n\n=== LL.B. ===\nThe J.D. was first conferred in the Philippines in lieu of the LL.B. by the Ateneo Law School in 1990, with the model program later adopted by most schools now offering the J.D. However, no president as of yet has graduated with the J.D., as all have earned the LL.B. prior to 1990.\n\n\n=== Master's ===\n\n\n=== Ph.D. ===\n\n\n=== Undergraduate ===\nSome presidents attended more than one institution, though only those from which they earned undergraduate degrees are included here.  Two presidents never earned undergraduate degrees: Emilio Aguinaldo never attended college, while Joseph Estrada dropped out from both colleges that he attended. One, Bongbong Marcos, did not finish his special diploma course at the Center for Research and Communication and received only a special diploma in social studies from the University of Oxford as he failed two components of his program of study, making him ineligible to receive an undergraduate degree. Marcos still falsely claims that he obtained a degree from Oxford despite Oxford confirming in 2015 and 2021 that Marcos did not finish his degree.\nThree presidents attended foreign colleges at the undergraduate level: Corazon Aquino, Fidel Ramos, and Bongbong Marcos. One president attended a United States service academy: Fidel Ramos graduated from the United States Military Academy as part of his professional education as a career soldier.\n\n\n== List by specialization ==\n\n\n=== Business school ===\n\n\n=== Law school ===\n\n\n== List by presidents ==\n\n\n== Other academic associations ==\n\n\n=== Faculty member ===\n\n\n=== School rector or president ===\n\n\n=== School trustee or governor ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nEducation in the Philippines\nList of prime ministers of Australia by education\nList of prime ministers of New Zealand by education\nList of prime ministers of Canada by academic degrees\nList of prime ministers of the United Kin\nListed below are the private residences of the various presidents of the United States. Except for George Washington all of them also lived at the White House (Executive Residence). For a list of official residences, see President of the United States § Residence.\n\n\n== Private homes of the presidents ==\n\nThis is a list of notable homes where presidents resided with their families before or after their term of office.\n\n\n== Presidential vacation homes ==\nDuring their term of office, many presidents have owned or leased vacation homes in various parts of the country, which are often called by journalists the \"Western White House\", \"Summer White House\", or \"Winter White House\", depending on location or season.\n\n\n=== Summer White House ===\nThe \"Summer White House\" is typically the name given to the summer vacation residence of the sitting president of the United States aside from Camp David, the mountain-based military camp in Frederick County, Maryland, used as a country retreat and for high-alert protection of presidents and their guests.\n\n\n=== Winter White House ===\nA \"Winter White House\" is typically the name given to the winter vacation residence of the standing president of the United States aside from Camp David, the mountain-based military camp in Frederick County, Maryland, used as a country retreat and for high-alert protection of the president and his guests.\nAlthough Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy had spent significant time in Florida (Harry Truman having spent time there in the summer), Richard Nixon's Florida White House was the first that reporters called the \"Winter White House\".\n\n\n=== Western/Southern White House ===\n\nThe Western White House and Southern White House are terms sometimes applied to additional residences of the president, especially when those residences are very distant from the District of Columbia. Famous examples include Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, as well as George W. Bush's Prairie Chapel Ranch in Crawford, Texas; Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan have also used the term for their private residences (Nixon and Reagan in California, Johnson in Texas).\n\n\n=== Other secondary \"White Houses\" ===\nThe first governmental spending on property improvements of private presidential residences was at Dwight Eisenhower's Gettysburg farm, where the Secret Service added three guard posts to a fence.

Of these, only one, Martin Van Buren, learned English as his second language; his first language was Dutch. Four of the earliest presidents were multilingual, with John Quincy Adams and Thomas Jefferson demonstrating proficiency in a number of foreign languages.\nJames A. Garfield and his successor Chester A. Arthur knew Ancient Greek and Latin, but it was Garfield's ambidexterity that would lead to rumors that he could write both at the same time. Both Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke French, and Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke German. As for Asian languages, James Madison studied Hebrew, Herbert Hoover spoke some Mandarin Chinese, while Barack Obama spoke Indonesian fluently as a child.\n\n\n== 18th century ==\n\n\n=== John Adams ===\nJohn Adams, the second president of the United States, learned to read Latin at a young age. In preparation for attending Harvard University, Adams attended a school for improving his Latin skills. While posted in France during the Revolutionary War, Adams became fluent in French.\n\n\n== 19th century ==\n\n\n=== Thomas Jefferson ===\nThomas Jefferson spoke and read multiple languages, which included French. According to notes he made while traveling in 1788, he was able to speak French, Latin, and Italian. He claimed to be able to read, as of 1817, these languages along with Greek and Spanish. He also studied and wrote about the Anglo-Saxon language (Old English) and studied German to some extent. After his death, a number of other books, dictionaries, and grammar manuals in various languages were found in Jefferson's library, suggesting that he studied additional languages, possibly including Arabic, Irish, and Welsh. His proficiency in these languages is not known.\nRegarding Spanish, Jefferson told John Quincy Adams that he had learned the language over the course of nineteen days while sailing from the United States to France. He had borrowed a Spanish grammar and a copy of Don Quixote from a friend and read them on the voyage. Adams expressed skepticism, noting Jefferson's tendency to tell \"large stories.\"\n\n\n=== James Madison ===\nJames Madison began his studies of Latin at the age of twelve and had mastered Greek, Latin, Italian, and French (the last reportedly with a Scottish accent) by the time he entered the College of New Jersey, later Princeton University. He produced many translations of Latin orations of Grotius, Pufendorf, and Vattel. He also studied Horace and Ovid. He learned Greek as an admissions requirement for higher college learning.\nWhile in college, Madison learned to speak and read Hebrew. When he could have graduated, Madison remained at college for an additional year to study ethics and Hebrew in greater depth.\n\n\n=== James Monroe ===\nJames Monroe was enrolled in the best school in the colony of Virginia, which is why Monroe was later able to immediately take advanced courses in Latin at the College of William & Mary.\nJames Monroe adopted many French customs while a diplomat in Paris, including learning fluent French. The entire Monroe family knew the language, and often spoke it with one another at home.\n\n\n=== John Quincy Adams ===\nJohn Quincy Adams went to school in both France and the Netherlands, and spoke fluent French and conversational Dutch. Adams strove to improve his abilities in Dutch throughout his life, and at times translated a page of Dutch a day to help improve his mastery of the language. Official documents that he translated were sent to the Secretary of State of the United States, so that Adams' studies would serve a useful purpose as well. When his father appointed him United States Ambassador to Prussia, Adams dedicated himself to becoming proficient in German in order to have the tools to strengthen relations between the two countries. He improved his skills by translating article\nIn political studies, surveys have been conducted in order to construct historical rankings of the success of the presidents of the United States. Ranking systems are usually based on surveys of academic historians and political scientists or popular opinion. The scholarly rankings focus on presidential achievements, leadership qualities, failures, and faults.\nPopular-opinion polls typically focus on recent or well-known presidents. \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nA 1948 poll was conducted by historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr. of Harvard University. A 1962 survey was also conducted by Schlesinger, who surveyed 75 historians. Schlesinger's son, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., conducted another poll in 1996.\nThe Chicago Tribune surveyed  49 historians in 1982.\nThe Siena College Research Institute has conducted surveys in 1982, 1990, 1994, 2002, 2010, 2018 and 2022 – during the second year of the first term of each president since Ronald Reagan. These surveys collect presidential rankings from historians, political scientists, and presidential scholars in a range of attributes, abilities, and accomplishments. The 1994 survey placed only two presidents, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln, above 80 points and two presidents, Andrew Johnson and Warren G. Harding, below 50 points.\nIn 1996, William J. Ridings Jr. and Stuart B. McIver conducted and published a poll and in 1997, an accompanying book on the poll results. 719 people took part in the poll, primarily academic historians and political scientists, although some politicians and celebrities also took part. Participants from every state were included and emphasis was placed upon getting input from female historians and \"specialists in African American studies\" as well as a few non-American historians. Poll respondents rated the presidents in five categories (leadership qualities, accomplishments, crisis management, political skill, appointments, and character and integrity) and the results were tabulated to create the overall ranking.\n\n\n=== 2000–2017 ===\nA 2005 presidential poll was conducted by James Lindgren for the Federalist Society and The Wall Street Journal. As in the 2000 survey, the editors sought to balance the opinions of liberals and conservatives, adjusting the results \"to give Democratic- and Republican-leaning scholars equal weight\". Franklin D. Roosevelt still ranked in the top three, but editor James Taranto noted that Democratic-leaning scholars rated George W. Bush the sixth-worst president of all time while Republican scholars rated him the sixth-best, giving him a split-decision rating of \"average\".\nIn 2008, The Times daily newspaper of London asked eight of its own \"top international and political commentators\" to rank all 42 presidents \"in order of greatness\".\nThe C-SPAN Survey of Presidential Leadership consists of rankings from a group of presidential historians and biographers. The C-SPAN Survey of Presidential Leadership has taken place four times: in 2000, 2009, 2017, and 2021. The 2021 survey was of 142 presidential historians, surveyed by C-SPAN's Academic Advisor Team, made up of Douglas G. Brinkley, Edna Greene Medford, Richard Norton Smith, and Amity Shlaes. In the survey, each historian rates each president on a scale of one (\"not effective\") to 10 (\"very effective\") on presidential leadership in ten categories: Public Persuasion, Crisis Leadership, Economic Management, Moral Authority, International Relations, Administrative Skills, Relations with Congress, Vision/Setting An Agenda, Pursued Equal Justice for All and Performance Within the Context of His Times—with each category equally weighed. The results of all four C-SPAN surveys have been fairly consistent. Abraham Lincoln has taken the highest ranking in each survey and George Washington, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Theodore Roosevelt have always ranked in the top five while James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson, and Franklin Pierce have been ranked at the bottom of all four surveys.\nTh\nThis is a list of vice presidents of the United States by other offices (either elected or appointive) held, either before or after service as the vice president.\n\n\n== Federal government ==\n\n\n=== Executive branch ===\n\n\n==== President ====\n\n\n==== Cabinet secretaries ====\n\n\n==== Ambassadors ====\n\n\n==== Other federal appointees ====\n\n\n=== Judicial branch ===\nNo vice presidents have yet served in the judicial branch.\n\n\n=== Legislative branch ===\n\n\n==== Senators ====\n\nA number of future and former vice presidents served together while in the Senate:\n\nKing served with R.

Johnson (1857–1861; 1875). Wilson and A. Johnson, during their continued service with each other (1861–1862), also served with Breckinridge (1861). Wilson also served with Hendricks (1863–1869).\nCurtis served with Barkley (1927–1929). Barkley later served with Truman (1935–1945), Humphrey (1955–1956) and L. Johnson (1955–1956). Humphrey and L. Johnson, who had served together before and after their service with Barkley (1949–1961), also served with Nixon (1950–1953). Humphrey would be succeeded by Mondale and would later serve with him (1971–1976) and Biden (1973–1978). Biden later served with Quayle (1981–1989) and Gore (1985–1993).\n\n\n==== Members of the House of Representatives ====\n\nA number of future vice presidents served in the House together:\n\nR.

The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.\nThe power of the presidency has grown substantially since the first president, George Washington, took office in 1789. While presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasingly significant role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, carrying over into the 21st century with notable expansions during the presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and George W. Bush. In modern times, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures and the leader of the world's only remaining superpower. As the leader of the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP, the president possesses significant domestic and international hard and soft power. For much of the 20th century, especially during the Cold War, the U.S. president was often called \"the leader of the free world\".\nArticle II of the Constitution establishes the executive branch of the federal government and vests executive power in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers.  Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy. The role includes responsibility for directing the world's most expensive military, which has the second-largest nuclear arsenal.\nThe president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of separation of powers, Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or veto federal legislation. Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent on the president. In recent decades, presidents have also made increasing use of executive orders, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to shape domestic policy.\nThe president is elected indirectly through the Electoral College to a four-year term, along with the vice president. Under the Twenty-second Amendment, ratified in 1951, no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. In addition, nine vice presidents have become president by virtue of a president's intra-term death or resignation. In all, 45 individuals have served 46 presidencies spanning 58 four-year terms. Joe Biden is the 46th and current president, having assumed office on January 20, 2021.\n\n\n== History and development ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, the Thirteen Colonies, represented by the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, declared themselves to be independent sovereign states and no longer under British rule. The affirmation was made in the Declaration of Independence, which was written predominantly by Thomas Jefferson and adopted unanimously on July 4, 1776, by the Second Continental Congress. Recognizing the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the British, the Continental Congress simultaneously began the process of drafting a constitution that would bind the states together. There were long debates on a number of issues, including representation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central government. Congress finished work on the Articles of Confederation to establish a perpetual union between the states in November 1777 and sent \nPresidents of the United States have often acquired nicknames, both flattering and unflattering.

Three attended the University of Edinburgh, three the University of Glasgow,  two Mason Science College, a predecessor institution of the University of Birmingham, and one - the incumbent prime minister Keir Starmer - the University of Leeds. John Major was (as of 2024) the last of the eight prime ministers who did not attend university after leaving secondary education. A number of the prime ministers who attended university never graduated. Oxford gained its 29th prime-ministerial alumnus when Liz Truss  succeeded Boris Johnson in September 2022, and its 30th - and fifth consecutive - a month later in Rishi Sunak. Starmer followed his undergraduate degree at Leeds with a postgraduate Bachelor of Civil Law degree at Oxford.\nTwenty prime ministers were schooled at Eton College, of whom nine were educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, including all three who held office between 1880 and 1902 (Gladstone, Salisbury, Rosebery). Seven were educated at Harrow School and six at Westminster School. Rishi Sunak was the second to be educated at Winchester College. Eleven prime ministers to date have been educated at only non-fee-paying schools; these include all five who held office between 1964 and 1997 (Wilson, Heath, Callaghan, Thatcher, Major). Theresa May was educated at both independent and grammar schools. Three did not receive (primary or secondary) school education and were homeschooled during childhood.\nSixteen Prime ministers trained as barristers at the Inns of Court, including 12 at Lincoln's Inn (although not all were called to the bar). Two (Wellington and Churchill) completed officer training at military academies.\nAlthough William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath (in 1746) and James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave (in 1757) briefly attempted to form governments, neither is usually counted as prime minister.

She has also been married for over 20 years to Frank Underwood, a Democratic Congressman from South Carolina. She is a crucial part in helping Frank manipulate his way into the presidency after he is betrayed for the secretary of state nomination by new president Garrett Walker.\nIn season 2, she is the new Second Lady of the United States from December 2013 after Frank becomes Walker's vice president. By the end of this season, she becomes First Lady of the United States in October 2014 when Frank ensures Walker's resignation and his own ascension to the position of president.\nIn season 3, she serves for a few months in 2015 as United States Ambassador to the United Nations but is forced to resign after falling for a manipulation of Russian President Viktor Petrov. The reason publicly stated for her resignation is to focus on Frank's re-election bid to cover up her failing. This event, combined with increasing tensions with Frank motivates her to leave him just before the Democratic New Hampshire primary in January 2016.\nAfter weeks of tensions between the two and a coverup of their marital split, Claire returns to Frank when he is shot and wounded in an assassination attempt in March 2016. This is however at the cost of Frank agreeing to make her his vice presidential candidate for the presidential election by manipulating the Democratic National Convention. With Frank facing investigation at the end of Season 4 due to past crimes, Claire suggests stirring up fear of terrorism to improve their popularity.\nDuring the events of Season 5, Claire is elected as Vice President of the United States in the 2016 election by the Senate initially after the Underwood campaign abuses presidential power to force Ohio and Tennessee into a scenario where their results cannot be certified, thus throwing the election of president to the House of Representatives. She becomes Acting President of the United States on January 20, 2017 due to the House being unable to choose between Frank and Republican nominee Will Conway. During her acting term, Claire proposes a new election in Ohio and Tennessee that is adopted by Congress and sees the Underwood's win after leaking damaging recordings of Conway and his vice presidential candidate, General Ted Brockhart.\nClaire resumes her new role as vice president once Frank resumes office in mid February 2017 but Frank is continually hounded by congressional investigations into his past. Frank, with the help of Chief of Staff Doug Stamper, manipulates events to allow a face saving resignation.\nTherefore, Claire is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on March 15, 2017 after Frank submits his resignation.

Frank then makes a deal with Raymond Tusk, a billionaire energy tycoon with significant influence over President Walker, to ensure Frank replaces Matthews as vice president. During these efforts, Frank is forced to murder his lover Zoe Barnes, a journalist,\nAssassination attempts and plots on the President of the United States have been numerous, ranging from the early 19th century to the present day. This article lists assassinations and assassination attempts on incumbent and former presidents and presidents-elect, but not on those who had not yet been elected president.\nFour sitting presidents have been killed: Abraham Lincoln (1865, by John Wilkes Booth), James A. Garfield (1881, by Charles J. Guiteau), William McKinley (1901, by Leon Czolgosz), and John F. Kennedy (1963, by Lee Harvey Oswald). Ronald Reagan (1981, by John Hinckley Jr.) is the only sitting U.S. president to have been injured in an assassination attempt while in office and survive. Theodore Roosevelt (1912, by John Schrank) and Donald Trump (2024, by Thomas Matthew Crooks) are the only two former presidents to be injured in an assassination attempt although Donald Trump would be re-elected later in 2024.\nIn all of these cases, the attacker's weapon was a firearm, and all the subjects were male. Gerald Ford experienced two attempted assassinations with a woman as the assailant.\nMany assassination attempts, both successful and unsuccessful, were motivated by a desire to change the policy of the American government. Not all such attacks, however, had political reasons. Many other attackers had questionable mental stability, and a few were judged legally insane. Historian James W. Clarke suggests that most assassination attempters have been sane and politically motivated, whereas the Department of Justice's legal manual claims that a large majority has been insane. Some assassins, especially mentally ill ones, acted solely on their own, whereas those pursuing political agendas have more often found supporting conspirators. Most assassination plotters were arrested and punished by execution or lengthy detention in a prison or insane asylum.\nThe fact that the successor of a removed president is the vice president, and all vice presidents since Andrew Johnson have shared the president's political party affiliation, may discourage such attacks, at least for policy reasons, even in times of partisan strife. The third person in line, the Speaker of the House, as outlined in the Presidential Succession Act, is often of the opposing party, however.\nThreats of violence against the president are often made for rhetorical or humorous effect without serious intent, while credibly threatening the president of the United States has been a federal felony since 1917.\n\n\n== Presidents assassinated ==\n\n\n=== Abraham Lincoln ===\n\nAbraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, was the first U.S. president to be assassinated (though not the first to die in office). The assassination took place on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., at about 10:15 PM. The assassin, John Wilkes Booth, was a well-known actor and a Confederate sympathizer from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate Army, he had contacts within the Confederate Secret Service. In 1864, Booth formulated a plan (very similar to one of Thomas N. Conrad previously authorized by the Confederacy) to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11, 1865 speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for Black people, Booth decided to assassinate the president instead. Learning that the president would be attending Ford's Theatre, Booth planned with co-conspirators to assassinate Lincoln at the theater. The conspiracy also included assassinating Vice President Andrew Johnson in Kirkwood House, where Johnson lived while Vice President.  and Secretary of State William H. Seward at Seward's house. On April 14, 1865 Lincoln attended the play Our American Cousin at Ford's Theatre. As the president sat in his state box in the balcony watching the play with his wife Mary and two guests, Major Henry Rathbone and Rathbone's fiancée Clara Harris, Booth entered from behind. He aimed a .44-calib\nThe second lady of the United States or second gentleman (SLOTUS or SGOTUS) is the informal title held by the spouse of the vice president of the United States, concurrent with the vice president's term of office. Coined in contrast to \"first lady\" – albeit used less commonly – the title \"second lady\" was apparently first used by Jennie Tuttle Hobart (wife of Garret Hobart, vice president 1897–1899) to refer to herself. The first second gentleman of the United States is Doug Emhoff, the husband of Kamala Harris, the current vice president and first woman in the position, since January 20, 2021.\nTwelve second ladies have gone on to become first ladies during their husbands' terms as president. The first to do this was Abigail Adams, who was married to John Adams, who was the first vice president from 1789 to 1797 and then the second president from 1797 to 1801. Thus, Abigail was the first second lady and the second first lady. The most recent to do this is Jill Biden, who is married to Joe Biden, the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 and then the 46th president since 2021.\nSince the 1970s, the vice presidential official residence is Number One Observatory Circle in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe second spouse's visibility in the public sphere has been a somewhat recent development. Although the role of the first lady as White House hostess dates from the beginning of the republic (and was typically filled by another member of the president's family if the president was unmarried or a widower), with a few exceptions, it was generally not until the late 20th century and early 21st century that vice-presidential wives took on public roles that attracted significant media attention.\nIn one notable exception, Floride Calhoun, wife of Vice President John C. Calhoun, was a central figure in the Petticoat Affair, a social-political scandal which involved the social ostracism of Secretary of War John H. Eaton and his wife Margaret O'Neill Eaton, further damaging already-strained relations between Vice President Calhoun and President Andrew Jackson.\n\nIn 1978, Muriel Humphrey, wife of Vice President Hubert Humphrey, became the only former second lady to hold public office; after her husband, who had returned to the U.S. Senate after his term as vice president, died in office, she was appointed by Minnesota governor Rudy Perpich to continue her husband's term.\nThere have been 17 periods of vacancy in the role, the longest of which continued for 16 years between the service of vice presidential spouses Abigail Adams and Ann Gerry when there were three widower vice presidents and a one-year vacancy in the vice presidency. The most recent second lady vacancy was for 132 days in 1974, between the service of Betty Ford and Happy Rockefeller, when the vice presidency was also vacant.\n\n\n=== Role in practice ===\nThe role of the second lady is unpaid and not formally defined. The wife of the vice president of the United States was traditionally expected to serve as a hostess and appear at society functions. Jennie Tuttle Hobart, wife of Vice President Garret Hobart (1897–1899) is often cited as the first woman to style herself as \"Second Lady\". Hobart took over the hostess duties on behalf of First Lady Ida Saxton McKinley, who had chronic health issues including epilepsy. Starting in 1917, the wife of the vice president took on the unofficial role of convener of the Red Cross Senate Wives, presiding over their lunches; the organization later became known as the Senate Spouses Club. The question of the second lady's status became a topic of debate in 1929 when Dolly Curtis Gann, the sister of Vice President Charles Curtis (1929–1933), assumed the role of hostess on his behalf, since he was widowed. Gann had waged a public \"battle of precedence\" against Alice Roosevelt Longworth, the wife of the late speaker of the House.\n\nOver time, the spouse of the vice president started to become more visible as the Office of the Vice President itself \nSince the office was established in 1789, 45 persons have served as president of the United States. Of these, eight have died in office: four were assassinated, and four died of natural causes. In each of these instances, the vice president has succeeded to the presidency. This practice is now governed by Section One of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1967, which declares that, \"the Vice President shall become President\" if the president is removed from office, dies, or resigns. The initial authorization for this practice was provided by Article II, Section 1, Clause 6, of the U.S. Constitution.\nThe first incumbent U.S. president to die was William Henry Harrison, on April 4, 1841, only one month after Inauguration Day. He died from complications of what at the time was believed to be pneumonia. The second American president to die in office, Zachary Taylor, died on July 9, 1850, from acute gastroenteritis. Abraham Lincoln was the first U.S. president to be killed while in office. He was shot by John Wilkes Booth on the night of April 14, 1865, and died the following morning. Sixteen years later, on July 2, 1881, James A. Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau, surviving for over two months before dying on September 19, 1881.\nOn September 14, 1901, William McKinley died, eight days after being shot by Leon Czolgosz. Next, Warren G. Harding suffered a heart attack, and died on August 2, 1923. On April 12, 1945, Franklin D. Roosevelt (who had just begun his fourth term in office) collapsed and died as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage. The most recent U.S. president to die in office was John F. Kennedy, who was shot by Lee Harvey Oswald on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas.\n\n\n== 1841: William Henry Harrison ==\n\nOn March 26, 1841, William Henry Harrison became ill with a cold after being caught in a torrential downpour without cover. His symptoms grew progressively worse over the ensuing two days, at which time a team of doctors was called in to treat him. After making a diagnosis of right lower lobe pneumonia, they proceeded to place heated suction cups on his bare torso and to administer a series of bloodlettings, to supposedly draw out the disease. When those procedures failed to bring about improvement, the doctors treated him with ipecac, Castor oil, calomel, and finally with a boiled mixture of crude petroleum and Virginia snakeroot. All this only weakened Harrison further.\nInitially, no official announcement was made concerning Harrison's illness, which, the longer he remained out of public view, fueled public speculation and concern. By the end of the month large crowds were gathering outside the White House, holding vigil while awaiting any news about the president's condition. On the evening of April 4, 1841, nine days after becoming ill, and exactly one month after taking the oath of office, Harrison died at age 68. His last words were to his attending doctor, though assumed to be directed at Vice President John Tyler:\n\nSir, I wish you to understand the true principles of the government. I wish them carried out. I ask nothing more.\nA 30-day period of mourning commenced following the president's death. Various public ceremonies, modeled after European royal funeral practices, were held. An invitation-only funeral service was also held, on April 7 in the East Room of the White House, after which Harrison's coffin was brought to Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C., where it was placed in a temporary receiving vault.\nThat June, Harrison's body was transported by train and river barge to North Bend, Ohio. Then, on July 7, 1841, the nation's 9th president was buried in a family tomb at the summit of Mt. Nebo, overlooking the Ohio River – the William Henry Harrison Tomb State Memorial.\nHarrison's death sparked a brief constitutional crisis regarding succession to the presidency, as the U.S. Constitution was unclear as to whether Vice President John Tyler should assume the of\nThis article includes information on the African heritage of presidents of the United States, together with information on unsubstantiated claims that certain presidents of the United States had African ancestry. (All Homo sapiens descend from ancestors on the African continent, but \"African heritage\" here means descent from sub-Saharan Africans in roughly the past 500 years.)\n\n\n== Presidents with African ancestry ==\n\n\n=== Barack Obama ===\nPresident Barack Obama, who served as the 44th president of the United States from 2009 to 2017, had an African father and an American mother of mostly European ancestry. His father, Barack Obama Sr. (1936–1982), was a Luo Kenyan from Nyang'oma Kogelo, Kenya. In July 2012, drawing on a combination of historical documents and Y-DNA analysis, Ancestry.com found a strong likelihood that Obama—through his mother, Stanley Ann Dunham—was descended from John Punch, known as the \"first official slave in the English colonies.\"\n\n\n== Unsubstantiated claims that presidents had African ancestry ==\nClaims that certain U.S. presidents other than Barack Obama had African or African-American ancestry have been made by the amateur historian J. A. Rogers, ophthalmologist Leroy William Vaughn, and psychologist Auset BaKhufu. All base their theories chiefly on the work of J. A. Rogers, who apparently self-published a pamphlet in 1965 claiming that five presidents of the United States, widely accepted as white, also had African ancestry. Historian Henry Louis Gates has written that Rogers' pamphlet \"would get the 'Black History Wishful Thinking Prize,' hands down\". Vaughn's and BaKhufu's books were also self-published.\nHistorians' and biographers' studies of these presidents have not supported such claims, and they lack empirical evidence. These authors are generally ignored by scholars. They have been classified as \"rumormongers and amateur historians\" as well as conspiracy theorists. Vaughn and BaKhufu have added little substantive research to their claims, but there have been more rumors of the potential African heritage of other presidents in the decades since Rogers published his pamphlet. These rumors are considered unsubstantiated and have not been acknowledged by historians.\n\n\n=== Thomas Jefferson ===\nVaughn and others claim Thomas Jefferson's mother Jane Randolph Jefferson was of mixed-race ancestry. The academic consensus does not support such claims. In her recent analyses of historical evidence about the Hemings and Jeffersons, for example, the scholar Annette Gordon-Reed makes no claim of African descent in the Randolph family.\nSpecifically, Vaughn says, \"The chief attack on Jefferson was in a book written by Thomas Hazard in 1867 called The Johnny Cake Papers.  Hazard interviewed Paris Gardiner, who said he was present during the 1796 presidential campaign, when one speaker states that Thomas Jefferson was a mean-spirited son of a half-breed Indian squaw and a Virginia mulatto father.\" An overlapping claim is that, in an 18th-century presidential campaign, someone speaking against Jefferson's candidacy and in favor of that of John Adams accused Jefferson of being \"half Injun, half nigger, half Frenchman\" and born to a \"mulatto father\" or slave and \"a half-breed Indian squaw\", this birth to a mulatto and an Indian allegedly \"well-known in the neighbourhood where he was raised\" but otherwise unproven. These claims are based on damning stories from Jefferson's political opponents and are best understood as race-baiting rather than evidence about his actual lineage. \nThe Thomas Jefferson Foundation, which owns and operates Monticello, the major public history site on Jefferson, characterizes Jefferson's parents this way: \"His father Peter Jefferson was a successful planter and surveyor and his mother Jane Randolph a member of one of Virginia's most distinguished families.\" They describe the quote in The Johnny Cake Papers as one frequently repeated, but it is attributed in written sources to the 1800 ra\nIn the United States, education is provided in public and private schools and by individuals through homeschooling. State governments set overall educational standards, often mandate standardized tests for K–12 public school systems and supervise, usually through a board of regents, state colleges, and universities. The bulk of the $1.3 trillion in funding comes from state and local governments, with federal funding accounting for about $260 billion in 2021 compared to around $200 billion in past years.\nPrivate schools are free to determine their own curriculum and staffing policies, with voluntary accreditation available through independent regional accreditation authorities, although some state regulation can apply.\nAs of 2013, about 87% of school-age children attended state-funded public schools, about 10% attended tuition and foundation-funded private schools, and roughly 3% were home-schooled.\nTotal expenditures for American public elementary and secondary schools amounted to $927 billion in 2020–21 (in constant 2021–22 dollars).\nBy state law, education is compulsory over an age range starting between five and eight and ending somewhere between ages sixteen and nineteen, depending on the state. This requirement can be satisfied in public or state-certified private schools, or an approved home school program. Compulsory education is divided into three levels: elementary school, middle or junior high school, and high school.\nNumerous publicly and privately administered colleges and universities offer a wide variety of post-secondary education. Post-secondary education is divided into college, as the first tertiary degree, and graduate school. Higher education includes public research universities, private liberal arts colleges, historically black colleges and universities, community colleges, for-profit colleges, and many other kinds and combinations of institutions. College enrollment rates in the United States have increased over the long term. At the same time, student loan debt has also risen to $1.5 trillion.\nThe large majority of the world's top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the United States, including 19 of the top 25, and the most prestigious – Harvard University. The country placed first in the annual U.S. News & World Report Best Countries for Education rankings. The U.S. has by far the most Nobel Prize winners in history, with 403 (having won 406 awards).\nIn 2010, the United States had a higher combined per-pupil spending for primary, secondary, and post-secondary education than any other OECD country (which overlaps with almost all of the countries designated as being developed by the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations) and the U.S. education sector consumed a greater percentage of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) than the average OECD country. In 2014, the country spent 6.2% of its GDP on all levels of education—1.0 percentage points above the OECD average of 5.2%. In 2018, primary and secondary per-pupil spending in the United States was 34 percent higher than the OECD average (ranking 5th of 36 countries reporting data), post-secondary per-pupil spending was double the OECD average (ranking 2nd), and the U.S. education sector consumed 6 percent of the U.S. GDP (ranking 6th).\nFrom 1960 through 2017, per-pupil spending in public kindergartens, primary schools, and secondary schools increased in inflation-adjusted terms from $3,793 to $14,439. From 1950 through 2015, student-teacher and student-nonteaching staff ratios in public kindergartens, primary schools, and secondary schools declined from 27.5 students per teacher and 65 students per nonteaching staff member in 1950 to 16.1 students per teacher and 16.1 students per nonteaching staff member in 2015 (with nonteaching staffing increasing by 709%), while teacher salaries declined by 2% in inflation-adjusted terms from 1992 to 2015. From 1976 to 2018, enrollment at post-secondary institutions increased \nThe United States secretary of education is the head of the United States Department of Education. The secretary serves as the principal advisor to the president of the United States, and the federal government, on policies, programs, and activities related to all education in the United States. As a member of the Cabinet of the United States, the secretary is sixteenth in the line of succession to the presidency.\nThe current secretary of education is Miguel Cardona, who was confirmed by the Senate on March 1, 2021.\n\n\n== Function ==\nThe United States secretary of education is a member of the president's Cabinet and is the fifteenth in the United States presidential line of succession. This secretary deals with federal influence over education policy, and heads the United States Department of Education.\nThe secretary is advised by the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity, an advisory committee, on \"matters related to accreditation and to the eligibility and certification process for institutions of higher education.\"\n\n\n== List of secretaries ==\nPrior to the creation of the Department of Education in 1979, Education was a division of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.\n\nParties\n  Democrat\n  Republican\n\nStatus\n\n\n=== Health, Education, and Welfare ===\n\n\n=== United States Secretary of Education ===\nSource\n\n\n== See also ==\nEducation in the United states\nSpecial education in the U.S\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nUnder Article I, Section 3, Clause 4 of the Constitution of the United States, the vice president of the United States is the ex officio president of the Senate but may only cast a vote in the Senate to break a tie. As of December 5, 2023, vice presidents have cast a total of 301 tie-breaking votes in the Senate. There are also two tie-breaking votes cast by Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase during the 1868 impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, although it is still debated whether he had the authority to do so.\n\n\n== Constitutional basis ==\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause 4 of the Constitution of the United States states:\n\nThe Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nJohn Adams, the first vice president of the United States, cast 29 tie-breaking votes during his tenure. His first vote was on July 18, 1789. He used his votes to preserve the president's sole authority over the removal of appointees, influence the location of the national capital, and prevent war with Great Britain. At times, he even convinced senators to vote against legislation that he opposed and often provided guidance on procedural and policy matters. Adams' political views and active role in the Senate made him a target for critics of the Washington administration. Toward the end of his first term, threatened by a resolution that would have silenced him on all but procedural and policy matters, he exercised more restraint, hoping to be elected president of the United States in his own right.\nJohn C. Calhoun was the only vice president to cast tie-breaking votes against his own president, Andrew Jackson. In 1832, Calhoun cast a tie-breaking vote to delay and later defeat the nomination of Martin Van Buren as United States Minister to the United Kingdom. Calhoun's supporters in the Senate allowed him to defy Jackson, where just enough of Calhoun's faction abstained to create a tie that he then broke.\nIn the early 21st century, the threat of a filibuster increased the use of cloture to end debate in the Senate, especially on highly divisive issues, making it rare for the vice president to have the opportunity to cast a decisive vote, as cloture requires a three-fifths majority. However, rules changes in 2013 and 2017 reduced the requirement for cloture on nominations to a simple majority, which led to the first use of a tie-breaking vote to confirm a Cabinet member when Vice President Mike Pence confirmed Betsy DeVos as secretary of education in 2017. In 2018, Pence cast a tie-breaking vote to confirm Jonathan A. Kobes to the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, the first such vote to confirm a judicial nominee in U.S. history. \nFollowing the 2020 Senate elections, the Senate was divided 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats in the 117th Congress. Votes by Vice President Kamala Harris played a critical role in passing Democratic legislation, including the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act. In addition, Harris gave the Democratic Party majority-control of the Senate. On July 20, 2021, Harris broke Pence's record for the most tie-breaking votes in the first year of a vice presidency, casting seven tie-breaking votes in her first six months. She cast a total of 15 tie-breaking votes in her first year, setting a new record for the most tie-breaking votes in a single year in U.S. history, surpassing the 12 votes cast by John Adams in 1790. On May 11, 2022, Harris set a new record for tie-breaking votes in a single day, casting four votes. On July 13, 2023, Harris matched Calhoun's record for the most tie-breaking votes cast by a vice president in U.S history at 31 votes. On December 5, 2023, Harris broke Calhoun's record. In response, she received a \"golden gavel\" from Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to recognize her record.\nThe recent dramatic rise in the frequency of vice presidential votes is due in part to the Senate often being equally \nThe following is a list of fictional presidents of the United States, A through B.\n\n\n== A ==\n\n\n=== President Truman Abbott ===\nPresident in: The Vegas Legacy by Ovid Demaris (1983).\nRuns for a second term when arriving in Las Vegas for his party's convention.\nIs challenged for re-nomination by former governor Hamilton Foote.\nCuts a deal with mobsters to take on corrupt Nevada senator Randolph Godwin as a running mate.\n\n\n=== President William Abbott ===\nPresident in: Advise and Consent\nSpeaker of the House and a Representative from Colorado.\nSucceeds to presidency upon assassination of President Harley Hudson.\nDeclines to run for reelection, which leads to the election contest between Orrin Knox (The Promise of Joy) and Edward M.

The vice president is also an officer in the legislative branch, as the president of the Senate. In this capacity, the vice president is empowered to preside over the United States Senate, but may not vote except to cast a tie-breaking vote. The vice president is indirectly elected at the same time as the president to a four-year term of office by the people of the United States through the Electoral College, but the electoral votes are cast separately for these two offices. Following the passage in 1967 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the US Constitution, a vacancy in the office of vice president may be filled by presidential nomination and confirmation by a majority vote in both houses of Congress.\nThe modern vice presidency is a position of significant power and is widely seen as an integral part of a president's administration. The presidential candidate selects the candidate for the vice presidency, as their running mate in the lead-up to the presidential election. While the exact nature of the role varies in each administration, since the vice president's service in office is by election, the president cannot dismiss the vice president, and the personal working-relationship with the president varies, most modern vice presidents serve as a key presidential advisor, governing partner, and representative of the president. The vice president is also a statutory member of the United States Cabinet and United States National Security Council and thus plays a significant role in executive government and national security matters. As the vice president's role within the executive branch has expanded, the legislative branch role has contracted; for example, vice presidents now preside over the Senate only infrequently.\nThe role of the vice presidency has changed dramatically since the office was created during the 1787 Constitutional Convention. Originally something of an afterthought, the vice presidency was considered an insignificant office for much of the nation's history, especially after the Twelfth Amendment meant that vice presidents were no longer the runners-up in the presidential election. The vice president's role began steadily growing in importance during the 1930s, with the Office of the Vice President being created in the executive branch in 1939, and has since grown much further. Due to its increase in power and prestige, the vice presidency is now often considered to be a stepping stone to the presidency. Since the 1970s, the vice president has been afforded an official residence at Number One Observatory Circle.\nThe Constitution does not expressly assign the vice presidency to a branch of the government, causing a dispute among scholars about which branch the office belongs to (the executive, the legislative, both, or neither). The modern view of the vice president as an officer of the executive branch—one isolated almost entirely from the legislative branch—is due in large part to the assignment of executive authority to the vice president by either the president or Congress. Nevertheless, many vice presidents have previously served in Congress, and are often tasked with helping to advance an administration's legislative priorities.\nKamala Harris is the 49th and current vice president of the United States. A former senator, she is the first African American, first Asian American and first female occupant of the office. Harris is the highest ranking female official in United States history. She assumed office on January 20, 2021.\n\n\n== History and development ==\n\n\n=== Constitutional Convention ===\nNo mention of an office of vice president was made at the 1787 Constitutional Convention until near the end, when an eleven-member committee on \"Leftover Business\" proposed a method\nThe following is a list of fictional presidents of the United States, S through T.\n\n\n== S ==\n\n\n=== President Elaine Sallinger ===\nPresidency mentioned in: Red Dwarf novel Better Than Life\nDescribed as \"perhaps the greatest American President of all time\".\nAppears only as the fifth carving on Mount Rushmore.\n\n\n=== President Robert Samuelson ===\nPresident in: the novel Red-12 by Louis A.

While these adjustments may be reflected in government programs over the following decade, the 10-year representative apportionments discussed below are not changed to reflect the miscount.\n\n\n=== House of Representatives ===\nBased on this decennial census, each state is allocated a portion of the 435 fixed seats in the United States House of Representatives (until the early 20th century, the apportionment process generally increased the size of the House based on the results of the census until the size of the House was capped by the Reapportionment Act of 1929), with each state guaranteed at least one Representative. The allocation is based on each state's proportion of the combined population of the fifty states (not including the District of Columbia, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, or the United States Virgin Islands).\n\n\n=== Electoral College ===\nThe Electoral College, every four years, elects the President and Vice President of the United States based on the popular vote in each state and the District of Columbia. Each state's number of votes in the Electoral College is equal to its number of members in the Senate plus members in the House of Representatives.\nThe Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution additionally grants the District of Columbia (D.C.), which is not part of any state, as many Electoral College votes as it would have if it were a state, while having no more votes than the least populous state (currently, Wyoming). Since the U.S. Constitution guarantees every state at least one member of the U.S. House of Representatives and two members of the U.S. Senate, every state has at least three Electoral College votes. Thus, the Electoral College has 538 members (100 senators, plus 435 representatives due to the limit imposed by the Reapportionment Act of 1929, plus 3 members for the District of Columbia). Territories of the United States such as Puerto Rico are not included in the Electoral College: people in those territories cannot vote directly for the President of the United States, although they may participate in the partisan nominating primaries and caucuses.\n\n\n== State and territory rankings ==\n\n* — non-voting member of the House of Representatives.\n\n\n== Summary of population by region ==\n\nColumn header abbreviations: # = Rank, Geo. = Geographic\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nGeneral\n\"National Totals: Vintage 2015\". United States Cens\nThe Cabinet of the United States is the principal official advisory body to the president of the United States. The Cabinet generally meets with the president in a room adjacent to the Oval Office in the West Wing of the White House. The president chairs the meetings but is not formally a member of the Cabinet. The vice president of the United States serves in the Cabinet by statute. The heads of departments, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, are members of the Cabinet, and acting department heads also participate in Cabinet meetings whether or not they have been officially nominated for Senate confirmation. The president may designate heads of other agencies and non-Senate-confirmed members of the Executive Office of the President as members of the Cabinet.\nThe Cabinet does not have any collective executive powers or functions of its own, and no votes need to be taken. There are 26 members: the vice president, 15 department heads, and 10 Cabinet-level officials, all except two of whom require Senate confirmation. During Cabinet meetings, the members sit in the order in which their respective department was created, with the earliest being closest to the president and the newest farthest away.\nThe members of the Cabinet whom the president appoints serve at the pleasure of the president. The president can dismiss them from office at any time without the approval of the Senate or downgrade their Cabinet membership status (the vice president of the United States is elected not appointed and serves in the Cabinet by statute). Functionally, the president may give wide latitude to department heads and often it is legally possible for a Cabinet member to exercise certain powers over his or her own department against the president's wishes, but in practice this is highly unusual due to the threat of dismissal. The president also has the authority to organize the Cabinet, such as instituting committees. Like all federal public officials, Cabinet members are also subject to impeachment by the House of Representatives and trial in the Senate for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\".\nThe Constitution of the United States does not explicitly establish a Cabinet. The Cabinet's role is inferred from the language of the Opinion Clause (Article II, Section 2, Clause 1) of the Constitution for principal officers of departments to provide advice to the president. Additionally, the Twenty-fifth Amendment authorizes the vice president, together with a majority of the heads of the executive departments, to declare the president \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\". The heads of the executive departments are—if eligible—in the presidential line of succession.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe tradition of the Cabinet arose out of the debates at the 1787 Constitutional Convention regarding whether the president would exercise executive authority solely or collaboratively with a cabinet of ministers or a privy council. As a result of the debates, the Constitution (Article II, Section 1, Clause 1) vests \"the executive power\" in the president singly, and authorizes—but does not compel—the president (Article II, Section 2, Clause 1) to \"require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices\". The Constitution does not specify what the executive departments will be, how many there will be, or what their duties will be.\nGeorge Washington, the first president of the United States, organized his principal officers into a Cabinet, and it has been part of the executive branch structure ever since. Washington's Cabinet consisted of five members: himself, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, Secretary of War Henry Knox and Attorney General Edmund Randolph. Vice President John Adams was not included in Washington's Cabinet because the position was initially reg",

Not all such attacks, however, had political reasons. Many other attackers had questionable mental stability, and a few were judged legally insane. Historian James W. Clarke suggests that most assassination attempters have been sane and politically motivated, whereas the Department of Justice's legal manual claims that a large majority has been insane. Some assassins, especially mentally ill ones, acted solely on their own, whereas those pursuing political agendas have more often found supporting conspirators.

In 1864, Booth formulated a plan (very similar to one of Thomas N. Conrad previously authorized by the Confederacy) to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11, 1865 speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for Black people, Booth decided to assassinate the president instead.

Following the passage in 1967 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the US Constitution, a vacancy in the office of vice president may be filled by presidential nomination and confirmation by a majority vote in both houses of Congress."

The presidential candidate selects the candidate for the vice presidency, as their running mate in the lead-up to the presidential election. While the exact nature of the role varies in each administration, since the vice president's service in office is by election, the president cannot dismiss the vice president, and the personal working-relationship with the president varies, most modern vice presidents serve as a key presidential advisor, governing partner, and representative of the president. The vice president is also a statutory member of the United States Cabinet and United States National Security Council and thus plays a significant role in executive government and national security matters.

Originally something of an afterthought, the vice presidency was considered an insignificant office for much of the nation's history, especially after the Twelfth Amendment meant that vice presidents were no longer the runners-up in the presidential election. The vice president's role began steadily growing in importance during the 1930s, with the Office of the Vice President being created in the executive branch in 1939, and has since grown much further. Due to its increase in power and prestige, the vice presidency is now often considered to be a stepping stone to the presidency. Since the 1970s, the vice president has been afforded an official residence at Number One Observatory Circle."

The modern view of the vice president as an officer of the executive branch—one isolated almost entirely from the legislative branch—is due in large part to the assignment of executive authority to the vice president by either the president or Congress. Nevertheless, many vice presidents have previously served in Congress, and are often tasked with helping to advance an administration's legislative priorities.\nKamala Harris is the 49th and current vice president of the United States. A former senator, she is the first African American, first Asian American and first female occupant of the office. Harris is the highest ranking female official in United States history.
