        "content": "Daniel \"Dani\" Alves da Silva (Portuguese: [dɐniˈɛw ˈawviz dɐ ˈsiwvɐ]; born 6 May 1983) is a Brazilian former professional footballer who played as a right-back. Widely regarded as one of the best full-backs of all time, he is also one of the most decorated players with 43 trophies.\nStarting his career at Bahia in 2001, Alves went on to have a successful six-year spell with Sevilla, winning two UEFA Cups and the Copa del Rey. He joined Barcelona for €32.5 million, becoming the third-most expensive defender of all-time at the time. He won the treble in his first season with the club and in the next season, won the Supercopa de España, UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup. Additionally, he helped the club to clinch another two Supercopa de España, five La Liga titles and two UEFA Champions League titles in the years that followed.\nIn 2016, Juventus signed Alves on a free transfer. He won the 2016–17 Serie A title and 2016–17 Coppa Italia in his only season with the side, also reaching the Champions League Final. In 2017, Alves joined French side Paris Saint-Germain on a free transfer, winning a domestic treble in his first season, followed by another league title the following season. In 2019, he returned to his home country, joining São Paulo, and winning the 2021 Campeonato Paulista with them. He returned to Barcelona in 2021. He joined Mexican club UNAM in 2022; UNAM terminated his contract in 2023 after he was detained in Spain, during a process that resulted in Alves being charged with sexual assault. He was convicted of this charge of rape in February 2024 and sentenced to four and a half years in prison.\nA full international for Brazil from 2006 to 2022, Alves is the nation's third most-capped player of all time. He was included in their squads for three FIFA World Cups and five Copa América tournaments, winning the 2007 and 2019 editions of the latter competition, as well as the 2009 and 2013 FIFA Confederations Cups. At the Summer Olympics in 2020, he won a gold medal. Individually, Alves was named in the IFFHS CONMEBOL Team of the Decade (2011–2020), FIFA Confederations Cup Team of the Tournament (2013), the Copa América Team of the Tournament (2019), and was awarded the Copa América Best Player (2019).\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAlves was born in Juazeiro, a city in the Brazilian state of Bahia, to father Domingos Alves da Silva, a farmer. He played football with the neighboring kids. Alves' father had a passion for football as well, and eventually managed to organize his own football team. Alves, at age 6, started as a winger, but because of the lack of goals he scored, his father re-positioned him as a right back, a position he still plays up to this day. Alves worked as a farmer and a trader in his youth.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Bahia ===\nAlves made his professional debut for Bahia in a match against Paraná Clube for the 2001 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A. Bahia won 3–0, with Alves providing two assists and winning a penalty for the other goal. Head coach Evaristo de Macedo thereafter gave him a starting place in the team. In Bahia, he won the 2002 Copa do Nordeste. His consistently good performances landed him a transfer, at first on loan, to Spanish side Sevilla, midway through 2002.\n\n\n=== Sevilla ===\n\nAfter 2002–03, on loan to Sevilla from Bahia, Alves travelled to play in the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship, where he impressed as Brazil won the tournament. He was named the third-best player of the tournament and, after this, the Sevilla move was made permanent.\nIn June 2006, Sevilla agreed to sell Alves to Liverpool, but Liverpool were unable to match Sevilla's asking price of around £8 million. In December 2006, he signed a new contract with Sevilla, tying him to the club until 2012. He had a successful 2006–07 season, making 47 appearances and scoring 5 goals. He played in every one of Sevilla's UEFA Cup matches, in a competition which the club went on to win.\nFrom his years in Spain, Alves acquired Spanish\nThe 2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or Gala was the third year for FIFA's awards for the top football players and coaches of the year.

It includes more than 300 young players and has been an instrumental factor in Barcelona's European success, and produces several world class players. It is widley considered to be one of the best academies in the world.\nIn 2010, La Masia became the first youth academy to have trained all three finalists for the Ballon d'Or in a single year: Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi.\nLa Masia is also the name of FC Barcelona's football training facilities, originally located near the Camp Nou in the Les Corts district of Barcelona. The original building itself was an ancient country residence (in Catalan, masia) built in 1702, and once Camp Nou was inaugurated in 1957, the building was remodelled and extended for use as the club's social headquarters. With the gradual expansion of the club, the building became too small for headquarters, and on 20 October 1979, La Masia was converted into a dormitory for young players from outside Barcelona. On 30 June 2011, the Masia building ceased housing the academy players. In a ceremony, the doors were closed and the Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper took over the function of the residential centre for the players.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nLa Masia de Can Planes was an old Catalan farmhouse, built in 1702. In 1979, it was first used by the club to house its young footballers who originated from outside Barcelona. The idea for the youth academy was proposed to Núñez by Jaume Amat, and Oriol Tort was put in charge of the facility.\nIn 2011, it was announced that Barcelona would be moving all its football training activities to La Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper.\nLa Masia received more publicity after Barcelona B's success with homegrown players; Rory Smith reported in The Daily Telegraph that La Masia \"has replaced the fabled Ajax Academy as football's foremost production line\". The recent fame and success of La Masia as a talent school was ascribed by Ian Hawkey of The Times to the class of 1987, which featured prominent members such as Cesc Fàbregas, Lionel Messi, Gerard Piqué and Pedro. In 2000, Louis van Gaal, coach of Barcelona's first team, was widely ridiculed by the city sports media for his dream to win the Champions League with 11 home-grown players. The first team won the trophy in 2009 with eight home-grown players.\nFrom 1979 to 2009, 440 youngsters have left their homes and families to stay at the academy. About half of them were from Catalonia, and the rest came from other regions of the Kingdom of Spain and beyond, including 15 from Cameroon, 7 from Brazil, 5 from Senegal and 3 from Argentina. Of those 440, 40 made it into Barcelona's first team.\n\n\n== Organization ==\n\nLa Masia houses about 60 players: 10 in the farmhouse, and the rest in rooms of the adjacent stadium; the rest of the youth players must provide for their own accommodation.\nThe academy is one of the most expensive in Europe, operating at a cost of £5 million a year. The main cost is the dormitory, La Masia itself. The minimum age for the youth program is six years; each year, more than 1,000 boys from the ages of six to eight try out for admission. The best 200 are selected. The club also actively seeks for prospective students; it employs a system in which 15 scouts are deployed in Catalonia, 15 in the rest of Spain and 10 scattered throughout the world. To alleviate the expenses of this scouting, the club has an agreement with 15 local clubs for them to train players who are not ready for entry into the youth academy. In return, FC Barcelona gives money, coaching and technical advice to these clubs for their services. While expanding its operations abroad, the club established five schools in Mexico and one in Egypt; successful applicants to these schools become full-time students, receiving academic education and football training.\nWhen Guardiola re-organised the reserve side, h\nThe 2013–14 season was Futbol Club Barcelona's 114th in existence and the club's 83rd consecutive season in the top flight of Spanish football. This was the first and only season under head coach Gerardo Martino.\nThis season was the first since 2006–07 without fellow teammate Eric Abidal, who departed to Monaco after his contract expired.\n\n\n== Kit ==\n\n\n== Season overview ==\n\n\n=== June ===\nOn 3 June, Brazilian Neymar was officially presented as a Barcelona player to more than 50,000 fans at Camp Nou.

On 20 June, after spending the previous season on loan to Mallorca, it was officially announced that Andreu Fontàs will be joining Celta de Vigo for a sum of €1 million.

Vilanova will not be able to perform his managerial duties as he undergoes further treatment for his illness. During the press conference, Rosell announced, \"After evaluating the results from the routine check-ups, which Tito Vilanova underwent this week, he was presented with the option to continue treatment to control his illness which will make it impossible to continue his responsibilities as the first team manager of the senior side.\" As a result, Barça rescheduled their pre-season match against Lechia Gdańsk in Poland to 30 July. On 23 July, former Newell's Old Boys manager Gerardo Martino was officially announced as the new coach of Barcelona and is subsequently signed a two-year contract with the club.

The season marked the managerial debut of Tito Vilanova, who served as Pep Guardiola's longtime assistant. Vilanova assumed management of the club after Guardiola, who had managed Barcelona for the prior four seasons, declined to renew his contract.\nBarcelona finished first in La Liga but lost in the semi-finals of both the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League. The club also set a record (later equaled by Real Madrid) by scoring in all 38 La Liga matches in the season.\n\n\n== Season overview ==\n\n\n=== May/June ===\nOn 29 May, Barcelona announced their first pre-season match to be against Hamburger SV in occasion of the German outfit's 125th anniversary celebration. It will be Tito Vilanova's first match in charge of the first team. The second match will be on 28 July in Tangier, Morocco, versus an all-star starting XI from the Moroccan Football League at the Stade de Tanger. This will be their first appearance in Morocco in 38 years.\nOn 1 June, Barcelona announced Brazilian defender Henrique will not return to team after both agreed to terminate the player's contract on 30 June.

President Ángel María Villar also confirmed that both Barcelona manager Tito Vilanova and Real Madrid manager José Mourinho will not have to serve their suspensions in the 2012 Supercopa de España for their altercation in last year's edition. Barça's Board Secretary Toni Freixa stated at a press conference that an \"aggression can never go unpunished\" and \"we understand that an aggression on a coach deserves punishment. This measure doesn't make the aggressor innocent but it allows them to believe that they can keep on being aggressive without consequences. It's a bad example for Spanish football that this aggression hasn't been punished.\"\nOn 13 July, Barcelona announced that the pre-season match on 28 July would be played against Raja Casablanca instead of Moroccan All-Star XI as previously announced.\nOn 24 July, Barcelona opened their pre-season with a 2–1 victory over Hamburg at the Imtech Arena. Goals scored by Dani Alves and Gerard Deulofeu to set off a victorious debut for Vilanova. Defender Marc Muniesa left the match with a torn ACL in his right knee in the 52nd minute that could possibly see him miss the rest of the season. The next day, Barcelona doctors confirmed that Muniesa will miss up to six months due to the injury picked up the day before.\nOn 27 July, Barcelona informed the Catalan Football Federation that Barcelona B, instead of the first team, will dispute the Supercopa de Catalunya against Espanyol set for 31 July at the Olímpic Lluís Companys.\nOn 28 July, Barcelona defeated Raja Casablanca 8–0 in Tangier with Lionel Messi supplying a hat-trick while Alexis Sánchez added another two goals while Dani Alves, Sergi Gómez, and Deulofeu scored one each.\nOn 30 July, Barcelona announced they accepted the rescheduled date of the Supercopa de Catalunya after the Catalan Football Association proposed the match to be played on 26 September 2012. They also stated that they would play the strongest team possible as chosen by the manager.\n\n\n=\nThe Best FIFA Football Awards 2017 were held on 23 October 2017 in London, United Kingdom.

Formerly in the Barcelonès, since 1990 it has been part of the comarca of Baix Llobregat. During recent decades Esplugues has evolved from a predominantly industrial town to a more diverse service area, preserving, however, its cultural and historical identity.\nIt is known for its characteristic old quarter, the only one in the Baix Llobregat area with such evocative and romantic areas. The winding Carrer de Montserrat goes through the sprawling architectural complex built between 1968 and 2017 by sculptor Xavier Corberó. The mansion of Can Cortada was home to the Baron Maldà, author of Calaix de Sastre, the most representative work of Catalan literature of the late 18th century. Esplugues holds a remarkable natural area with parks and green spaces such as the Park of Solidarity, the Park of Torrents and the Can Vidalet Park. From the mountain of Sant Pere Màrtir, it is possible to enjoy a picturesque viewpoint of the entire town.\nThe German School of Barcelona and the American School of Barcelona are located in town and attract wealthy expatriate families. Due to its proximity to the Camp Nou stadium, many famous footballers reside in Esplugues, such as Gerard Piqué, Andrés Iniesta, and Dani Alves, as well as the motorcycle racer Sete Gibernau, the former World Number 1 tennis player Arantxa Sánchez, and other personalities in Spanish showbiz.\n\n\n== City connection ==\nEsplugues de Llobregat has an excellent road network, being connected to the highways B-20 and B-23, the N-340 road, and its location right across from the Avinguda Diagonal, the most important avenue in Barcelona. The city resides 11 km (7 mi) away from the Airport of Barcelona, it is 13 km (8 mi) away from the port of Barcelona, and 10 km (6 mi) away to the Catalan capital downtown.\nIt is linked to Barcelona through the following bus lines: 57, 63, 67, 68, 157, metropolitan buses, and T1, T2 and T3 Trambaix lines. The only metro station in the area is Can Vidalet, on the L5 line. Two other stops are under construction and will be opened in 2018.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first nominal legal land section, a little portion of land with a few homes and a few inhabitants, in what is today Esplugues was made in 1096. The first documents which talk about a town called Esplugues de Llobregat date from the 14th century.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nThe municipality has a population of 46,447.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nInternational schools in the municipality include:\n\nGerman School of Barcelona\nAmerican School of Barcelona\n\n\n== Twin towns ==\n Ahrensburg, Germany\n Macael, Spain\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nAilyn, singer and songwriter\nCarme Chacón, politician and minister of Defence\nXavier Corberó, sculptor\nÓscar Jaenada, actor\nMercedes Milá, journalist\nLorenzo Milá, journalist\nGerard Piqué, football player\nVíctor Ruiz, football player\nLamine Yamal, football player\n\n\n== References ==\n\nPanareda Clopés, Josep Maria; Rios Calvet, Jaume; Rabella Vives, Josep Maria (1989).

More common than racism per se are the attitudes linked to xenophobia and nationalism (specially the Spanish, the Catalan and the Basque ones), as well as religious and/or linguistic-cultural hatred.\n\n\n== Historical roots ==\nDuring the Spanish Inquisition, the descendants of Jews and Muslims were targeted the most. This policy was called Limpieza de sangre (Blood Cleansing). Even after a Jew or a Muslim (Muwallad, an Arab or a Berber) converted to Christianity, the contemporary Spanish authorities referred to them and their descendants as New Christians, and as a result, they were the targets of popular and institutional discrimination and  they were also the targets of suspicion by the Spanish Inquisition. New Christians of Muslim heritage were referred to as moriscos, meaning Moor-like. Those of Jewish heritage were termed Conversos and those who secretly continued to practice Judaism were referred to as marranos (either from the Spanish word marrar which means to err/deviate or from the Spanish word marrano which means \"swine\".). After the Reconquista, many Mudéjars (individual Moors, who remained in Iberia after the Christian Reconquista but were not converted to Christianity) remained in Spain as practicing Muslims and Sephardic Jews were required to convert to Catholicism or leave the country in 1492. Attitudes towards Moriscos varied in different regions, but they were never the main targets of the Inquisition. A few decades after the War of the Alpujarras, during which the Muslim-majority population of Granada rebelled, the King of Spain ordered the Expulsion of the Moriscos from Spain, which was successfully implemented in the eastern region of Valencia and was less successfully  implemented in the rest of Spain.\nWhile Medieval persecutions of Jews and Muslims were aimed at converting or eliminating non-Christians, limpieza de sangre was linked to the ancestry of the new Christians, regardless of their fervor or their lack of it.\n\n\n== Enslavement of Sub-Saharan Africans ==\nDuring the Late Middle Ages and during the Modern era, a small number of Sub-Saharan Africans were captured or bought and sold as slaves.\nThe slaves who were born in Sub-Saharan Africa were called bozales.\nTheir descendants were called Black Ladinos because they had a better command of the Spanish language.\nDuring the Spanish colonization of the Americas, the territories which were inhabited by Native Americans were massively depopulated as a result of mass genocide, Old World illnesses and the hardships which were caused by the conquest and the exploitation which followed it.\nSub-Saharan African slaves were taken to the Indies as laborers. Initially, they were taken from Spain and later, they were taken from Sub-Saharan Africa. Today, the descendants of these enslaved black people still populate the former Spanish colonies and as a result, they constitute a major community within the African diaspora. \n\n\n== Gitanos ==\n\nThe Gitanos are the descendants of Romani people who migrated from Northern Africa and France and arrived in Spain in the late Middle Ages.\nThey lived a nomadic lifestyle until the 20th century and as a result, they were blamed for crime by the sedentary population.\nThe authorities' treatment of the Gitanos varied from persecution to forcible assimilation.\nThe Gitanos are the descendants of Romani people who migrated from the Indian Subcontinent and began migrating towards Europe during the 10th and 11th centuries. The earliest documentation of Romani people’s presence in Spain is traced back to the 15th century. \nThe Roma population is the longest-standing ethnic minority in Spain and has a\nThe 2014–15 season was Futbol Club Barcelona's 115th in existence and the club's 84th consecutive season in the top flight of Spanish football. This was the first of the three seasons under head coach Luis Enrique.\nThe season was one of the most successful ones in the club's history, as Barcelona clinched its second continental treble after winning La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League. The league title was won in a closely fought title race with Real Madrid, while the Copa victory was achieved with a brilliant 3–1 victory over Athletic Bilbao at Camp Nou in the final. In the Champions League, Barcelona overcame Bayern Munich (3–0 home, 2–3 away) to set up the final against Juventus in Berlin, where Barça triumphed 3–1. Barcelona's success may be in large part attributed to their formidable attacking trio composed of Lionel Messi, Neymar, and summer signing Luis Suárez, who scored a record 122 goals in all competitions to become the trio with most goals in a single season in Spanish football history.\nThe season was the first since 1998–99 without former captain Carles Puyol, who retired at the end of last season, 2001–02, and 2006–07 without goalkeepers Víctor Valdés and José Manuel Pinto. Valdés joined Manchester United in January 2015; whereas Pinto announced his retirement.\n\n\n== Season overview ==\n\n\n=== May ===\nAt the end of the 2013–14 FC Barcelona season, goalkeepers José Manuel Pinto and Víctor Valdés expired contracts were not renewed. Barcelona quickly signed Marc-André ter Stegen from Bundesliga club Borussia Mönchengladbach, and Claudio Bravo from fellow La Liga outfit Real Sociedad. On 15 May, long-time captain Carles Puyol announced his retirement from football after a 15-year career on the first team. Puyol was subsequently named Assistant to Sports Management under Director of football Andoni Zubizarreta. On 19 May, Luis Enrique was named the new manager after it was announced that Gerardo Martino would step down at the end of the season. Luis Enrique returned to Barça after being the B Team manager from 2008 to 2011.\n\n\n=== June ===\nOn 12 June, Barcelona and Premier League club Chelsea reached an agreement for the transfer of midfielder Cesc Fàbregas for a reported fee of €33 million. With the move, Fàbregas returned to London where he started his first team career as an Arsenal player. On 16 June, Barcelona signed Croatian midfielder Ivan Rakitić from Sevilla for €18 million along with the loan of Barcelona B midfielder Denis Suárez for the next two seasons. Rakitić joins after leading Sevilla to the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League title, where he was named man of the match in the final.\n\n\n=== July ===\nOn 9 July, Barcelona announced the transfer of Jonathan dos Santos to Villarreal for a fee of €2 million. Most of his last season with the club was spent recovering from an ACL tear which he suffered in training on 23 October 2013. With the move, Jonathan reunites with his older brother Giovani dos Santos, since both players shared time on the Barcelona youth team. On 10 July, Barcelona announced it had rescinded the contract of forward Isaac Cuenca. Cuenca then made the move to Deportivo de La Coruña, where he signed for one season to join the Galician club. Later in the day, Barcelona completed the transfer of Alexis Sánchez to Arsenal for €42 million. Sánchez left after three years when he had played 141 matches and scored 47 goals, including a season personal best of 21 goals during the 2013–14 season.\nOn 11 July, Barcelona and English club Liverpool announced the transfer of Uruguayan international forward Luis Suárez for a reported fee of £75 million. The reigning European Golden Shoe winner joins after spending four seasons with the Merseyside club in which he scored 82 goals in 133 appearances. Barcelona were without Suárez's services after the FIFA Disciplinary Committee banned the player for four months of any football-related activity after he was found guilty of biting Italian defender Gio\nArgentine footballer Lionel Messi, widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, has been awarded throughout his career a total of eight Ballon d'Or awards and three The Best FIFA Men's Player awards, the most for any player.

This was the first year in which players from clubs outside the UEFA federation were eligible for nomination; this change also led to an increase in the voting pool to include journalists from outside UEFA countries.\nKaká was the fourth Brazilian national to win the award after Ronaldo (1997, 2002), Rivaldo (1999), and Ronaldinho (2005). He was the sixth Milan player to win the trophy after Gianni Rivera (1969), Ruud Gullit (1987), Marco van Basten (1988, 1989, 1992), George Weah (1995), and Andriy Shevchenko (2004).\nThe ceremony is notable as Kaká was the last player to win the Ballon d'Or before the Messi–Ronaldo dominance of the award.

The match was contested by Middlesbrough of England and Sevilla of Spain. Both sides were making their first appearance in a European final; it was Middlesbrough's second season of European competition, while Sevilla had more previous experience in both the UEFA Cup and the European Cup. Both sides had qualified for the competition based on their domestic league positions the previous season, and entered in the first round. To reach the final, they subsequently had to progress through the group stage and knockout rounds to reach the final. Middlesbrough eliminated VfB Stuttgart, Roma, Basel and Steaua București in the knockout stages, while Sevilla beat Lokomotiv Moscow, Lille, Zenit Saint Petersburg and Schalke 04.\nIn front of a crowd of 36,500, Sevilla dominated the final. They took the lead in the 27th minute, when Luís Fabiano headed in a cross from Dani Alves. Middlesbrough switched to an attacking formation in the 70th minute, but Sevilla were able to counter-attack, and doubled their advantage when Enzo Maresca scored from a rebound. Maresca scored his second six minutes later, and Frédéric Kanouté added another for Sevilla in the final minute, to make them 4–0 winners.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe UEFA Cup was an annual football club competition organised by UEFA since 1971 for eligible European football clubs. Clubs qualified for the competition based on their performance in their national leagues and cup competitions. It was the second-tier competition of European club football, ranking below the UEFA Champions League. In 2009, the UEFA Cup evolved into the Europa League.\nMiddlesbrough had made their first appearance in European football the previous season, when they were eliminated 4–2 by Sporting CP in the last-16. Sevilla's best European season had also been their first, when they reached the quarter-finals of the 1957–58 European Cup, before suffering a heavy 10–2 aggregate loss to Real Madrid. The two sides had never previously met. Middlesbrough qualified for the tournament due to their seventh-place finish in the 2004–05 FA Premier League, while Sevilla had finished sixth in the 2004–05 La Liga.\n\n\n== Route to the final ==\n\n\n== Match ==\n\n\n=== Summary ===\nThe final was played at Philips Stadion in Eindhoven, Netherlands on 10 May 2006, and kicked off at 20:45 CEST. The match was attended by 36,500 people. Sevilla kicked off the match, and had the first attack in the second minute: Dani Alves shot wide. Two minutes later, the Sevilla defender Javi Navarro fouled Mark Viduka, conceding a free kick which Fábio Rochemback struck straight at the Sevilla goalkeeper, Andrés Palop. Sevilla attacked twice more in the opening ten minutes, but on both occasions, the Middlesbrough defender Chris Riggott was able to put the ball behind for a corner kick. After 20 minutes, Sevilla attacked down their right wing; Alves had the opportunity to shoot, but passed the ball across to Javier Saviola, whose shot was blocked by Gareth Southgate. Six minutes later, Sevilla attacked through Alves again. He crossed the ball to Luís Fabiano who headed the ball in off the post to give Sevilla a 1–0 lead. Three minutes later, Sevilla had another chance at goal, but Adriano shot went over the crossbar. In the 34th minute, Middlesbrough won another corner, but it was easily cleared by the Sevilla defence. In the final five minutes of the first half, Sevilla pressed hard for a second goal, consistently putting crosses in the Middlesbrough penalty area. Their closest effort came when Julien Escudé headed wide from a José Luis Martí free kick, but despite their pressure, it remained 1–0 at half-time.\nBoth sides made changes at half-time: Middlesbrough replaced James Morrison with Massimo Maccarone, while Frédéric Kanouté replaced Saviola for Sevilla. The Spanish side continued to dominate \nThe Golden Foot award is an international football award, given to players who stand out for their athletic achievements (both as individuals and team players) and for their personality. The award is only given to active players of at least 27 years of age, and can only be won once.\nTen nominees are chosen by a panel of international journalists based on the criteria that they are at least 27 years of age and still playing. Out of this list, and until 2022, the winner was selected by an online poll, where anyone could vote. From 2024, the winner is selected by a committee of professionals chaired by Antonio Caliendo, the founder of the award. The winner of the award leaves a permanent mould of his footprints on \"The Champions Promenade\", on the seafront of the Principality of Monaco.\nSince 2009, there has been a charity auction accompanying the Golden Foot event. The auction is held during the gala evening at the Hôtel de Paris Monte-Carlo, and raises funds for fighting AIDS.\n\n\n== Award winners ==\n\n\n=== By country ===\n\n\n=== By club ===\n\n\n== Women's Golden Foot ==\nAn equivalent award for women's football was assigned from 2022 onwards.\n\n\n== Award legends ==\n\n\n=== Total by country ===\n\n\n== Golden Foot Prestige Award ==\nA Prestige Award was given from 2020 onwards.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nThe Golden Foot official site\nThe 2015–16 season was Futbol Club Barcelona's 116th in existence and the club's 85th consecutive season in the top flight of Spanish football. Barcelona was involved in six competitions after completing its second continental treble in the previous season.\nThe season produced a domestic double of La Liga and Copa del Rey wins, with Barça coming out on top in a closely fought title race and defeating newly crowned Europa League winners Sevilla in the Copa del Rey final after extra time. However, Barça failed to clinch its second sextuple after 2009 by losing the Supercopa de España to Copa del Rey runners-up Athletic Bilbao (0–4 away, 1–1 home). Barcelona did manage to finish the year with five trophies, repeating 2011, by clinching the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup titles. Barcelona was also aiming and considered a favourite to repeat as Champions League winners to become the first team in the modern era to do so, but they were knocked out by Atlético Madrid in the quarter-finals (2–1 home, 0–2 away) in a strange repeat of their meeting at the same stage two years prior.\nThe season was the first since 1997–98 without former captain Xavi, who departed to Al Sadd SC.\n\n\n== Season overview ==\n\n\n=== June ===\nOn 7 June, Barcelona announced the transfer of right-wing Aleix Vidal from fellow La Liga outfit and 2015 UEFA Europa League winners Sevilla. The player will join on a five-year deal with a transfer fee of €18 million plus variables. On 9 June, the club announced that right back Dani Alves is set to stay at the club after signing a contract renewal for two years with an option for another year. On 10 June, Barcelona announced that the presidential elections will take place on 18 July, after Josep Bartomeu resigned as president to qualify for re-election. On 25 June, Barcelona announced La Masia graduate Gerard Deulofeu was transferred to English side Everton for a reported fee of €6 million. The player returned to Merseyside after spending the 2013–14 season on loan there under fellow Spaniard manager Roberto Martínez.\n\n\n=== July ===\nOn 3 July, Barcelona announced that La Masia graduate Martín Montoya would join Italian side Internazionale on a season-long loan with an option for a second. On 6 July, Barcelona announced the signing of Turkey national team captain Arda Turan from Atlético Madrid for €34 million. The player will join on 1 January 2016 after the FIFA transfer ban is lifted. On 18 July, Josep Bartomeu was elected president of Barcelona for the next six years with the third most votes in the club's history. On 21 July, Barcelona kicked off the preseason with a 1–2 victory over Major League Soccer champions LA Galaxy in the 2015 International Champions Cup. Goals from Luis Suárez and Sergi Roberto secured the win in front of a crowd of 93,226 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. On 23 July, Barcelona were fined €30,000 by UEFA for fans waving pro-Catalan independence banners at the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final. The club maintains its respect for the sanction, yet does not agree with it and its legal services will consider the possibility of questioning the fine at a later time. On 25 July, Barcelona were defeated by English side Manchester United with a scoreline of 1–3 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. The lone goal came from Rafinha in the 89th minute of play. On 28 July, Barcelona were defeated in penalties by Chelsea at FedExField in Landover, Maryland. Goals from Luis Suárez and Sandro were enough to earn the regular time draw, however the team lost in penalties 4–2 to end their United States Summer Tour.\n\n\n=== August ===\nOn 2 August, Barcelona finished their pre-season tour with a visit to Fiorentina at the Stadio Artemio Franchi in Florence. The match ended with a 2–1 loss to the Catalans, the lone Barça goal coming from Luis Suárez. Three days later, on 5 August, Barcelona took on Italian club Roma in the 50th edition of the annual Joan Gamper Trophy. The game ended 3–0 to the C",

The club also actively seeks for prospective students; it employs a system in which 15 scouts are deployed in Catalonia, 15 in the rest of Spain and 10 scattered throughout the world. To alleviate the expenses of this scouting, the club has an agreement with 15 local clubs for them to train players who are not ready for entry into the youth academy. In return, FC Barcelona gives money, coaching and technical advice to these clubs for their services. While expanding its operations abroad, the club established five schools in Mexico and one in Egypt; successful applicants to these schools become full-time students, receiving academic education and football training."
