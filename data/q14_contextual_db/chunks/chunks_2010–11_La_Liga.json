        "content": "The 2010–11 La Liga (known as the Liga BBVA for sponsorship reasons) was the 80th season of La Liga since its establishment. The campaign began on 28 August 2010, and concluded on 21 May 2011. A total of 20 teams contested the league, 17 of which already partook in the 2009–10 season, and three of which were promoted from the Segunda División. In addition, a new match ball – the Nike Total 90 Tracer – served as the official ball for all matches.\nDefending champions Barcelona secured a third consecutive and overall 21st La Liga title following a 1–1 draw with Levante on 11 May 2011. The result gave Barcelona a six-point lead with two matches remaining which, combined with their superior head-to-head record against Real Madrid, ensured that they would finish top of the table. Barcelona led the table since defeating Real Madrid 5–0 on 23 November 2010. From that point onwards, they lost only one match en route to winning the title. Barcelona's Lionel Messi won La Liga's Award for Best Player for a third straight year.\nThe season was again dominated by Barcelona and Real Madrid, with second-place Madrid 21 points ahead of third-place Valencia. Having also faced off in the Champions League semi-finals and the Copa del Rey final, the top two rivals met four times over seventeen days, for a total of five meetings this season.\n\n\n== Teams ==\nReal Valladolid, CD Tenerife and Xerez CD were relegated to the Segunda División after finishing the 2009–10 season in the bottom three places. Tenerife and Xerez made their immediate return to the second level after just one year in the Spanish top flight, while Valladolid ended a three-year tenure in La Liga.\nThe relegated teams were replaced by 2009–10 Segunda División champions Real Sociedad from San Sebastián, runners-up Hércules CF from Alicante and Levante UD from Valencia. Hércules returned to the highest Spanish football league for the first time after 13 years, while Real Sociedad and Levante terminated their second-level status after three and two years, respectively.\n\n\n=== Stadia and locations ===\n\n\n=== Personnel and sponsorship ===\n\n^ Barcelona makes a donation to UNICEF in order to display the charity's logo on the club's kit.\n\n\n=== Managerial changes ===\n\n\n== League table ==\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n=== La Liga Awards ===\nLa Liga's governing body, the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional, honoured the competition's best players and coach with Awards.\n\n\n=== Top goalscorers ===\n\n\n=== Top assists ===\n\nSource: ESPN Soccernet Archived 26 October 2010 at the Wayback Machine\n\n\n=== Zamora Trophy ===\nThe Ricardo Zamora Trophy is awarded by newspaper Marca to the goalkeeper with the lowest ratio of goals conceded to matches played.

The season commenced on 23 July 2010 and ended on 21 May 2011.  A winter break where no matches were played was held between 11 December 2010 and 18 February 2011. A total of eighteen teams participated in the league, where CFR Cluj were the defending champions.\n\n\n== Teams ==\nPolitehnica Iași, Ceahlăul Piatra Neamț and Unirea Alba Iulia were relegated to Liga II after finishing the 2009–10 season in the bottom three places. Ceahlăul Piatra Neamț and Unirea Alba Iulia made their immediate return to the second level, while Politehnica Iași ended a six-year tenure in the highest football league of Romania. 15th-placed team Pandurii Târgu Jiu, who originally were to be relegated as well, were allowed to remain in Liga I after Internațional Curtea de Argeș withdrew from the league because of financial reasons. Internațional thus returned to Liga II after having been promoted the previous season.\nThe four relegated teams were replaced by the champions and runners-up from both 2009–10 Liga II divisions. Victoria Brănești and Sportul Studențesc were promoted from Seria I while Târgu Mureș and Universitatea Cluj were promoted from Seria II, with Victoria Brănești and Universitatea Cluj being constrained to play their home games on grounds in other cities (than home based) as their did not meet Liga I requirements.\n\n\n=== Venues ===\n\n\n=== Personnel and kits ===\n\n\n=== Managerial changes ===\n\n\n== League table ==\n\n\n=== Positions by round ===\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== Top goalscorers ==\n\nSource: Liga1.ro (in Romanian)\n1 Bogdan Stancu was transferred to Galatasaray during the winter transfer window.\n\n\n== Champion squad ==\n\n\n== References ==\nThe 2010–11 Liga IV was the fourth level of the Romanian football league system.

The club was formed in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, and played its first competitive match on 13 May 1902, when it lost 3–1 in the semi-final of the Campeonato de Copa de S.M. Alfonso XIII against FC Barcelona. Real Madrid played against other local clubs in various regional tournaments, that served as qualifiers for the Copa del Rey, from 1902 to 1940. In 1929, the club became one of the founding members of La Liga, Spain's first national league. As of 2024, Real is one of only three clubs never to have been relegated from the top level of Spanish football, the others being Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona.\nFrom 1902 to 1929, Real won the Copa del Rey five times and the regional championship 15 times. Real Madrid had a successful start in La Liga, finishing second in the competition's first season, and winning the league in 1932 for the first time. In the 1947–48 season, Madrid finished eleventh, which remains, as of 2024, the club's lowest final position. Real Madrid won La Liga four times and the European Cup five times during the 1950s. However, the most successful period for the club in terms of domestic titles was the 1960s, when Real Madrid won eight league championships. It won its first double of league championship and national cup in 1962. Real is also the only Spanish football team to win five consecutive titles, a feat which it has achieved on two occasions (1960–65 and 1985–90).\nReal Madrid is the most successful club in UEFA competitions, winning 25. The club first participated in European competition during the 1954–55 season, when it played in the Latin Cup. It won its first major European title, and the inaugural European Cup, during the 1955–56 season. Real Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup, and a further nine titles, the last of which was in 2022, holding the record for the most victories in the tournament. The club won the UEFA Cup during the 1984–85 season and retained the trophy the following year.\nThe club has won La Liga 36 times, the Copa del Rey 20 times, the Supercopa de España 12 times, the Copa de la Liga once, the Copa Eva Duarte once, the European Cup/Champions League 15 times, the UEFA Cup twice, the European/UEFA Super Cup five times, the Intercontinental Cup three times and the FIFA Club World Cup five times. The table details the club's achievements in the early regional championships and in all national and international first team competitions for each completed season since the club's formation in 1902.\nThe club won at least one trophy for seventeen consecutive seasons (from 1953–54 to 1969–70), a record in Spanish football. Its most recent trophy came in 2024 with a 15th Champions League.\n\n\n== Key ==\n\n\n== Seasons ==\nPrior to 1929, Spain did not have a national football league. Real Madrid competed in the championship of the Madrid region, called Campeonato Centro, the winners of which qualified for the Copa del Rey along with the other regional champions. In 1929, La Liga, Spain's first national football league, was formed, with Real Madrid among the founder members. The club also competed in the regional championship until it was abandoned in 1940. The Copa del Rey continued alongside La Liga. Clubs continued to qualify for it based on their placings in the regional championships until 1940, when it became open to all teams in the top two divisions of the Spanish league and select other teams.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== General ===\n\"Football honours\".

It is controlled by the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional and it is contested by 20 teams over a 38-matchday period.\nSince its inception, 62 teams have competed in La Liga. Nine teams have been crowned champions, with Barcelona winning the inaugural La Liga and Real Madrid winning the title a record 36 times. Real Madrid are also the most recent winners, having won the 2023–24 edition. During the 1940s Valencia, Atlético Madrid and Barcelona emerged as the strongest clubs, winning several titles. Real Madrid and Barcelona dominated the championship in the 1950s, each winning four La Liga titles during the decade. During the 1960s and 1970s, Real Madrid dominated La Liga, winning fourteen titles, with Atlético Madrid winning four. During the 1980s and 1990s Real Madrid were prominent in La Liga, but the Basque clubs of Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad had their share of success, each winning two Liga titles. From the 1990s onward, Barcelona has dominated La Liga, winning seventeen titles to date. Although Real Madrid has also been prominent, winning eleven titles, La Liga has also seen other champions, including Valencia and Deportivo La Coruña. \nAccording to UEFA's league coefficient rankings, La Liga was the top league in Europe in each of the seven years from 2013 to 2019 (calculated using accumulated figures from five preceding seasons) and led Europe for 22 of the 60 ranked years up to 2019, more than any other country. It also has produced the continent's top-rated club more times (22) than any other league in that period, more than double that of second-placed Serie A (Italy), including the top club in 10 of the 11 seasons between 2009 and 2019; each of these pinnacles was achieved by either Barcelona or Real Madrid. La Liga clubs have won the most UEFA Champions League (20), UEFA Europa League (14), UEFA Super Cup (16) and FIFA Club World Cup (8) titles, and its players have accumulated the highest number of Ballon d'Or awards (24), The Best FIFA Men's Player awards (19) and UEFA Men's Player of the Year awards (12).\nLa Liga is one of the most popular professional sports leagues globally, with an average attendance of 26,933 for league matches in the 2018–19 season. This is the eighth-highest of any domestic professional sports league in the world and the third-highest of any professional association football league in the world, behind fellow big five leagues Bundesliga and Premier League, and above Serie A and Ligue 1. La Liga is also the seventh wealthiest professional sports league in the world by revenue, after the NFL, MLB, the NBA, the Premier League, the NHL, and the Bundesliga.\nFrom 2008 to 2016, it was sponsored by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria and known as Liga BBVA. Then, from 2016 to 2023, it was sponsored by Banco Santander and known as LaLiga Santander. Since 2023, it has been sponsored by Electronic Arts and is known as LaLiga EA Sports.\n\n\n== Competition format ==\nThe competition format follows the usual double round-robin format. During the course of a season, which lasts from August to May, each club plays every other club twice, once at home and once away, for 38 matches. Teams receive three points for a win, one point for a draw, and no points for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, with the highest-ranked club crowned champion at the end of the season.\n\n\n=== Promotion and relegation ===\nA system of promotion and relegation exists between the Primera División and the Segunda División. The three lowest placed teams in La Liga are relegated to the Segunda División, and the top two teams from the Segunda División promoted to La Liga, with an additional club promoted after a series of play-offs involving the third, fourth, fifth an\nThe 2010–11 season was FC Barcelona's 111th in existence and the club's 80th consecutive season in the top flight of Spanish football. Barcelona started the season with a new president after Joan Laporta reached his term limit on 30 June, leaving behind a very successful club tenure.\nSandro Rosell was elected president on 13 June by securing a record total of 35,021 votes (61.35%), more than the 27,138 achieved by Laporta in 2003. Rosell began his tenure on 1 July as the 39th president in Barcelona's history.\nThis team is widely considered to be one of the greatest club sides of all time. Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has described this squad as the best he had ever faced.\n\n\n== Season overview ==\n\n\n=== June ===\nBarcelona started their transfer window only three days after the end of the 2009–10 season, by reaching an agreement with Valencia for Spanish international David Villa worth €40 million.\nOn 30 June, Xavier Sala-i-Martin, treasurer and director in charge of the economic area, announced that Barcelona earned a record €445.5 million in revenue during the 2009–10 season. According to Xavier, \"that's the highest revenues achieved by any club, in any sport including the U.S.\" This means FC Barcelona is the richest club in the world in terms of revenue.\nCoach Pep Guardiola later expressed disapproval of the transfer of Ukrainian centre-back Dmytro Chyhrynskyi, indicating he was pressed to let him go. Speaking at a press-conference, Guardiola said, \"My opinion counts, but the needs of the club go above that and that's why he was sold, I would like to have kept him.\" Speaking on the departing Yaya Touré, Guardiola said he would have preferred him to stay, but the player was set on moving.\nOn 14 July, Thierry Henry and Barcelona agreed to rescind his contract in order for Henry to become a free agent, where he subsequently signed a new four-and-a-half-year contract with Major League Soccer's New York Red Bulls. He stated, \"This is a new and exciting chapter in my career.\" The club also agreed with Pep Guardiola on a one-year extension to stay as coach of the first team, along with long-time assistant Tito Vilanova.\n\n\n=== August ===\nOn 27 August, Barcelona reached an agreement with English club Liverpool for the services of Argentine international Javier Mascherano. The deal was worth €24 million and was reached \"after considerable effort from the club [Barcelona] over the last few hours and the willingness and desire of the player to make the move\". On the same day, Barcelona's executive committee of the board of directors publicly \"denounced the conduct over the last few days of the agent of our player Zlatan Ibrahimović, Mino Raiola, whose declarations have put into question the honour and moral integrity of our coach Pep Guardiola\". The club's legal department considered the possibility of rescinding the contract and the cessation of the annual payment Raiola's company receives from the club as part of their agreement. The next day, Barcelona and Italian club Milan agreed to a one-year loan for the Swedish international, with Milan paying all his earnings for the 2010–11 season and including in the agreement the option for Milan to make the move permanent next summer for a fee of €24 million.\n\n\n=== September ===\nCoach Guardiola stated, \"It will cost us a lot. We expect a difficult year in which things have to be won by ourselves. Right now, the team is not at full strength at this point in the season.\"\nOn 19 September, Lionel Messi suffered an ankle injury due to an ill-advised tackle by Atlético Madrid defender Tomáš Ujfaluši in the 92nd minute of their Round Three match at the Vicente Calderón Stadium. At first sight, it was feared that Messi suffered a broken ankle that could have kept the star player away from the pitch for a minimum of six months, but MRIs performed the next day in Barcelona showed he suffered a sprain in the internal and external ligaments of his right ankle. Teammate David Villa s\nThe 2010–11 season was the 105th season in Atlético Madrid's history and their 74th season in La Liga, the top division of Spanish football. It covers a period from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011.\nAtlético Madrid competed for their tenth La Liga title and participated in the UEFA Europa League as holders, entering in the Group stage due to their seventh-place finish in the 2010–11 La Liga. They also entered the Copa del Rey in the quarter-finals, where they were eliminated by eventual winners Real Madrid.\nThis season was the first since 2003–04 without Pablo Ibáñez who departed for English club West Bromwich Albion.\n\n\n== Kits ==\nSupplier: Nike / Main Sponsor: Kia Motors / Back Sponsor: Kyocera / Shorts Sponsor: Paf\n\n\n== Transfers ==\nIn (summer):\n Filipe Luís: €12m from Deportivo La Coruña\n Diego Godín: €8m from Villarreal\n Fran Mérida: Free from Arsenal\n Diego Costa: From Valladolid\n Mario Suárez: From RCD Mallorca\nIn (winter):\n Juanfran: €4m from Osasuna\n Elías: From Corinthians\nOut (summer):\n José Manuel Jurado: €13m to Schalke\n Pablo Ibanez: Free to West Brom\n Mariano Pernía: To Nacional\nOut (winter):\n Simão: €0.9m to Beşiktaş\n Ignacio Camacho: To Malaga\n Juanito: Free to Valladolid\n\n\n== Squad ==\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

The club was founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper, and played its first friendly match on 8 December 1899. Initially, Barcelona played against other local clubs in various Catalan tournaments, but in 1929 the club became one of the founding members of La Liga, Spain's first national league. As of 2024, Barcelona is one of only three clubs to have never been relegated from the top level of Spanish football, the others being Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid.\nIn the period from 1919 to 1929, Barça won the Copa del Rey five times and the Campionat de Catalunya nine times. Barcelona enjoyed a successful start in La Liga, winning the championship in the competition's first season. However, they did not win the league again until 1945. Three seasons prior to that, Barcelona finished twelfth, which remains, as of 2024, the club's lowest league finish. Barcelona won five trophies in the 1951–52 season, becoming known as \"Barça of the Five Cups\" (Catalan: el Barça de les Cinc Copes), and went on to win La Liga three times, the Copa del Rey five times and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup once during the 1950s. The club then entered a lean spell, with only two league titles between 1960 and 1990. In 1988, former legendary player Johan Cruyff was appointed manager and assembled what would later be known as the \"Dream Team\". In 1991, he led the club to its first league title in six years and repeated the feat the following season when Barça also won the European Cup for the first time. In the 1993–94 season, Barcelona won their fourth consecutive league title, edging out Deportivo de La Coruña on goal difference after the two clubs finished level on points.\nNewly elected president Joan Laporta's  appointment of Frank Rijkaard as coach and the signing of Ronaldinho in 2003 marked the beginning of another spell of sustained success. In 2005, Barcelona once again won La Liga championship, and retained it the following season. In May 2006, Barcelona defeated Arsenal in the Champions League final, coming back from 0–1 to win 2–1 in the last fifteen minutes. Three years later, the club beat Manchester United 2–0 in the 2009 Champions League final, having already won La Liga and the Copa del Rey that season, to become the first Spanish side to complete the treble. In December 2009, Barcelona won the Club World Cup, having also won the Spanish and European Super Cups, thereby completing an unprecedented sextuple.\nThe club has won La Liga championship 27 times, the Copa del Rey 31 times, the Copa de la Liga twice, the Supercopa de España fourteen times, the Copa Eva Duarte three times, the Champions League five times, the Cup Winners' Cup four times, the Fairs Cup three times, the Super Cup five times and the Club World Cup three times. The table details the club's achievements in the early regional championships and in all national and international first-team competitions for each completed season since the club's formation in 1899.\n\n\n== Key ==\n\nTop scorers shown in italics with number of goals scored in bold  are players who were also top scorers in La Liga that season.\n\n\n== Seasons ==\n\n\n=== Pre-La Liga era ===\nDuring this period Spain did not have a national football league. Barcelona competed in the championship of the Catalonia region, the winners of which qualified for the Copa del Rey along with the other regional champions. Barcelona also won the Pyrenees Cup, the first competition played between European clubs, four times (1910, 1911, 1912, 1913).\n\n\n=== La Liga era ===\nIn 1929, La Liga, Spain's first national football league, was formed, with Barcelona among the founding members.

Clubs continued to qualify for it based on their placings in the regional champi\nThe 2010–11 season was Real Madrid Club de Fútbol's 80th season in La Liga. This article shows player statistics and all matches (official and friendly) that the club played during the 2010–11 season.\nThe rebuilt Madrid under star manager José Mourinho successfully fought on all fronts, going toe to toe with a brilliant Barcelona side which some regard as the greatest team in football history. Ultimately, Madrid finished second in the league, with 92 points and four behind their perennial rivals, defeated them in the Copa del Rey final, and lost to Barça in the Champions League semi-finals, where Real progressed to for the first time since 2002–03. Moreover, from 16 April through 3 May, a rare occurrence happened when, for the first time ever, four Clásicos were to be played in a span of just 18 days. The first fixture was in the league campaign on 16 April (which ended 1–1 with penalty goals for both sides), the second one was in the Copa del Rey final (which was won by Madrid 1–0 a.e.t., bringing them their first trophy in the second Galáctico era) on 20 April and the third and fourth ones in the two-legged Champions League semi-finals on 27 April and 3 May (Barcelona won on aggregate with a 2–0 away victory and a 1–1 home draw). The matches in the Champions League proved the most controversial, as multiple refereeing decisions were harshly criticized by Mourinho and Madrid players who accused UEFA of favoring the Catalan side. Namely, Pepe's red card in the 61st minute of the first leg was questioned, after which Barcelona scored two goals, with Mourinho being ejected and subsequently banned for the second leg for protesting, and several controversial offside calls were made, as well as Real having a goal disallowed in the second leg, when the score was tied 0–0. Madrid again became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals, repeating its output from the previous season, with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring a record 40 and winning the European Golden Shoe.\nThis season was the first since 1993–94 without Raúl, who departed to join Schalke 04 after his contract was terminated, having stayed at the club for sixteen years and the first since 1994–95 without Guti who departed to join Beşiktaş.\n\n\n== Club ==\n\n\n=== Coaching staff ===\n\n\n=== Kit ===\nSupplier: AdidasSponsor(s): bwin.com\n\nSource: \"The new shirt of Real Madrid 2010/11\".

They spent nine seasons in the prime of their careers facing off regularly while playing for rival clubs Barcelona and Real Madrid.\nTogether, they have achieved various historical milestones, coming to be considered as two of the best footballers of all time. They are two of the most decorated players ever, having won 77 official trophies in total (Messi 44, Ronaldo 33) during their senior careers thus far, and have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season. According to IFFHS, they are the only two players to score over 800 goals each in their careers for club and country. Ronaldo holds the record for most official goals in a career.\nJournalists and pundits regularly argue the individual merits of both players in an attempt to establish who they believe is the best player in modern football or ever. Regardless of preference, football critics generally agree that they are both the best players of their generation, outperforming their peers by a significant margin. Ronaldo has received praise for his physical attributes, goalscoring skills, and performance under pressure, while Messi is lauded for his combination of dribbling, playmaking, passing and goalscoring. Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two, while part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players; Ronaldo is sometimes described as someone of temperamental character while Messi is considered to have a more reserved personality.\nThe rivalry has been compared to past global sports rivalries such as the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Prost–Senna rivalry in motorsport, and the tennis rivalries between Djokovic–Nadal and Federer–Nadal.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nIn 2007, Ronaldo and Messi finished as runners-up to AC Milan's Kaká in both the Ballon d'Or, an award rewarded to the player voted as the best in the world by an international panel of sports journalists, and the FIFA World Player of the Year, an award voted for by coaches and captains of international teams. In an interview that year, Messi was quoted as saying that \"Cristiano Ronaldo is an extraordinary player and it would be brilliant to be in the same team as him.\"\nThey first played in a game against each other when Manchester United were drawn to play Barcelona in the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League semi-finals and were immediately pitted as major rivals. Ronaldo missed a penalty in the first leg, but United eventually advanced to the final via a Paul Scholes goal.\nThe 2009 UEFA Champions League final was contested between Manchester United and Barcelona on 27 May 2009 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, Italy. The match, described as a \"dream clash\", was again hyped as the latest battle between the two, this time to settle who was the best player in the world. Ronaldo explained to always go out on to the field believing he is the best. \"For me, you have to have that confidence at all times. That's what makes me the player I am.\" Messi's club-mate Xavi sided with his fellow Barcelona player: \"Messi is the best player in the world by a distance, he's the No1.\" Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was more diplomatic, praising both players as being amongst the world's elite talents. Barca successfully kept United at arm's length to win 2–0, with Messi scoring a rare header for his team's second goal.\n\n\n=== El Clásico ===\n\nOn 11 June 2009, Manchester United accepted an offer of £80 million (€94 million) for Ronaldo to be transferred to Barcelona's El Clásico rivals Real Madrid. The transfer was confirmed on 1 July.\nFrom 2009 to 2018, the two played against each other at least twice per season during\nThe La Liga Awards, previously known as the LFP awards, are presented annually by the Liga de Fútbol Profesional (LFP) to the best players and coach in La Liga, the first division of association football in Spain. Established in the 2008–09 season, they were the first official awards in the history of the Spanish competition. La Liga's best coach and player in each position—goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, and forward—were chosen based on a voting by the captain and vice-captains of each club, while the best player overall was determined via statistical analysis.\nSince the La Liga Awards' creation, Barcelona players have won 32 honours in the six main categories, almost triple the number of any other club. Barcelona's forward Lionel Messi has been named La Liga's best player for six times and La Liga's best forward for seven times, both all-time records. Across all positions, the other outstanding individuals are Barcelona midfielder Andrés Iniesta with five wins, Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola with four wins, Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos with four wins, and goalkeepers Iker Casillas of Real Madrid and Víctor Valdés of Barcelona with two wins each.\nMany of the awards were discontinued after the 2015–16 season.\n\n\n== Main categories ==\n\n\n=== Winners ===\n\n\n== Additional categories ==\n\n\n== Other La Liga honours ==\nThe following awards were presented once:\n\n\n=== Player of the season ===\n\n\n=== Best African player ===\n\n\n=== Team of the season ===\n\n\n=== Player and manager of the month ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nDon Balón Award\nMiguel Muñoz Trophy\nTrofeo Alfredo Di Stéfano\nTrofeo Aldo Rovira\nTrofeo EFE\nRicardo Zamora Trophy\nPichichi Trophy\nZarra Trophy\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\nCitations\nArgentine footballer Lionel Messi, widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, has been awarded throughout his career a total of eight Ballon d'Or awards and three The Best FIFA Men's Player awards, the most for any player. He holds the record for the most goals in La Liga (474), the Supercopa de España (14), the UEFA Super Cup (3) and is the player with the most official recorded assists in football history (378). He has scored 849 goals for club and country throughout his professional career and is also the first and only player in history to win five and six European Golden Shoes.
