{"page_content": "Lionel Andr\u00e9s Messi (Spanish pronunciation: [ljo\u02c8nel an\u02c8d\u027ees \u02c8mesi] ; born 24 June 1987), also known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and the Argentina national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi set numerous records for individual accolades won throughout his professional footballing career such as eight Ballon d'Or awards and eight times being named the world's best player by FIFA. He is the most decorated player in the history of professional football having won 45 team trophies, including twelve league titles, four UEFA Champions Leagues, two Copa Am\u00e9ricas, and one FIFA World Cup. Messi holds the records for most European Golden Shoes (6), most goals for a single club (672, with Barcelona), most goals (474), hat-tricks (36) and assists (192) in La Liga, most matches played (39), assists (18) and goal contributions (34) in the Copa Am\u00e9rica, most matches played (26) and goal contributions (21) in the World Cup, most international appearances (189) and international goals (112) by a South American male, and the second-most in the latter category outright. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi has scored over 850 senior career goals for club and country.\nBorn in Rosario, Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at age 13, and made his competitive debut at age 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008\u201309 helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won the first of his four consecutive Ballons d'Or, the first player to win it four times. During the 2011\u201312 season, he set La Liga and European records for most goals in a season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, he finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, his perceived career rival, before regaining his best form during the 2014\u201315 campaign, where he became the all-time top scorer in La Liga, led Barcelona to a historic second treble, and won a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. During his overall tenure at Barcelona, Messi won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles and four UEFA Champions Leagues, among others. He signed for French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, where he would win the Ligue 1 title during both of his seasons there. Messi joined American club Inter Miami in July 2023, and set a new mark for most goals scored for the club by his second season.\nAn Argentine international, Messi is the national team's all-time leading goalscorer and most-capped player. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew career-long comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. At the youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship and gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. After his senior debut in 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a World Cup in 2006. He assumed the national team's captaincy in 2011, and then led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica and the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario, all of which they would lose. After initially announcing his international retirement in 2016, he returned to help his country narrowly qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, which they would again exit early. Messi and the national team finally broke Argentina's 28-year trophy drought with a victory in the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica, where he was named the tournament's best player and which later helped him win his seventh Ballon d'Or that year. He then led Argentina to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup, his country's third overall world championship and first in 36 years. This followed wi\nThe Messi\u2013Ronaldo rivalry, or Ronaldo\u2013Messi rivalry, is a sporting rivalry in football propelled by the media and fans that involves Argentine footballer Lionel Messi and Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, mainly for being contemporaries and due to their similar records and sporting successes. They spent nine seasons in the prime of their careers facing off regularly while playing for rival clubs Barcelona and Real Madrid.\nTogether, they have achieved various historical milestones, coming to be considered as two of the best footballers of all time. They are two of the most decorated players ever, having won 77 official trophies in total (Messi 44, Ronaldo 33) during their senior careers thus far, and have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season. According to IFFHS, they are the only two players to score over 800 goals each in their careers for club and country. Ronaldo holds the record for most official goals in a career.\nJournalists and pundits regularly argue the individual merits of both players in an attempt to establish who they believe is the best player in modern football or ever. Regardless of preference, football critics generally agree that they are both the best players of their generation, outperforming their peers by a significant margin. Ronaldo has received praise for his physical attributes, goalscoring skills, and performance under pressure, while Messi is lauded for his combination of dribbling, playmaking, passing and goalscoring. Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two, while part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players; Ronaldo is sometimes described as someone of temperamental character while Messi is considered to have a more reserved personality.\nThe rivalry has been compared to past global sports rivalries such as the Muhammad Ali\u2013Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Prost\u2013Senna rivalry in motorsport, and the tennis rivalries between Djokovic\u2013Nadal and Federer\u2013Nadal.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nIn 2007, Ronaldo and Messi finished as runners-up to AC Milan's Kak\u00e1 in both the Ballon d'Or, an award rewarded to the player voted as the best in the world by an international panel of sports journalists, and the FIFA World Player of the Year, an award voted for by coaches and captains of international teams. In an interview that year, Messi was quoted as saying that \"Cristiano Ronaldo is an extraordinary player and it would be brilliant to be in the same team as him.\"\nThey first played in a game against each other when Manchester United were drawn to play Barcelona in the 2007\u201308 UEFA Champions League semi-finals and were immediately pitted as major rivals. Ronaldo missed a penalty in the first leg, but United eventually advanced to the final via a Paul Scholes goal.\nThe 2009 UEFA Champions League final was contested between Manchester United and Barcelona on 27 May 2009 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, Italy. The match, described as a \"dream clash\", was again hyped as the latest battle between the two, this time to settle who was the best player in the world. Ronaldo explained to always go out on to the field believing he is the best. \"For me, you have to have that confidence at all times. That's what makes me the player I am.\" Messi's club-mate Xavi sided with his fellow Barcelona player: \"Messi is the best player in the world by a distance, he's the No1.\" Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was more diplomatic, praising both players as being amongst the world's elite talents. Barca successfully kept United at arm's length to win 2\u20130, with Messi scoring a rare header for his team's second goal.\n\n\n=== El Cl\u00e1sico ===\n\nOn 11 June 2009, Manchester United accepted an offer of \u00a380 million (\u20ac94 million) for Ronaldo to be transferred to Barcelona's El Cl\u00e1sico rivals Real Madrid. The transfer was confirmed on 1 July.\nFrom 2009 to 2018, the two played against each other at least twice per season during\nLionel Messi is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and the Argentina national team. His individual achievements include eight Ballon d'Or awards, the most for any footballer. Having won 45 team trophies, he is the most decorated player in the history of professional football. His remarkable goal-scoring ability, masterful ball control, high level passing and playmaking as well as his outstanding dribbling skills has earned him recognition as one of the greatest and most iconic players in football history. In 2024, US-based sports company ESPN named Messi the greatest player of the 21st-century.\nMessi's club career began with Barcelona, where he rose through the youth ranks, making his first-team debut in 2004. Over the next years, Messi became the club's all-time leading scorer, amassing numerous domestic and international accolades. During his tenure, Barcelona secured ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Reys, four UEFA Champions League, seven Supercopa de Espa\u00f1as, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cups. In August 2021, due to financial constraints faced by Barcelona, Messi transferred to Paris Saint-Germain (PSG). Joining forces with fellow superstars like Neymar and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, he won two Ligue 1 titles and one Troph\u00e9e des Champions. In July 2023, Messi transferred to Inter Miami, leading the team to win their first-ever trophies with the Leagues Cup and the Supporters' Shield.\nOn the international stage, Messi made his debut with Argentina's senior national football team in 2005, and would represent the country in five FIFA World Cups, seven Copa Am\u00e9ricas, and one Finalissima. Initially facing criticism for not winning major tournaments with the senior national team, Messi broke Argentina's 28-year international trophy drought by captaining the team to victory in the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica, the 2022 Finalissima, the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Barcelona ===\n\n\n==== 2004\u201306: Rise to the first team and becoming a starting eleven player ====\n\nDuring the 2004\u201305 season, Lionel Messi was a guaranteed starter for the Barcelona B team, playing 17 games throughout the campaign and scoring on six occasions. Since his debut in the friendly the previous November, he had not been called up to the first team again, but in October 2004, the senior players asked manager Frank Rijkaard to promote him. Since Ronaldinho already played on the left wing, Rijkaard moved Messi from his usual position onto the right flank (though initially against the player's wishes), allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot.\nMessi made his league debut with Barcelona's senior team during the next match on 16 October, against Espanyol at Estadi Ol\u00edmpic Llu\u00eds Companys in Montju\u00efc, coming on in the 82nd minute. At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition. As a substitute player, he played 244 minutes in nine matches for the first team that season, including his debut in the UEFA Champions League against Shakhtar Donetsk. He scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005, against Albacete, from an assist by Ronaldinho, becoming \u2013 at that time \u2013 the youngest-ever scorer for the club. Barcelona, in their second season under Rijkaard, won the league for the first time in six years.\n\nOn 24 June, his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first contract as a senior team player. It made him a Barcelona player until 2010, two years less than his previous contract, but his buyout clause increased to \u20ac150 million. His breakthrough came two months later, on 24 August, during the Joan Gamper Trophy, Barcelona's pre-season competition. A starter for the first time, he gave a well-received performance against Fabio Capello's Juventus, receiving an ovation from the Camp Nou. Capello sought to take Messi to Juventus on\nArgentine footballer Lionel Messi, widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, has been awarded throughout his career a total of eight Ballon d'Or awards and three The Best FIFA Men's Player awards, the most for any player. He holds the record for the most goals in La Liga (474), the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a (14), the UEFA Super Cup (3) and is the player with the most official recorded assists in football history (378). He has scored 849 goals for club and country throughout his professional career and is also the first and only player in history to win five and six European Golden Shoes.

He also holds the record for most goals by a South American male, surpassing Brazilian Pel\u00e9's 77 goals with a hat-trick against Bolivia on 9 September 2021. He currently sits as the second-highest international goalscorer of all time after scoring against Canada in the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica semi-final.\nMessi made his debut for Argentina in a 2\u20131 away win over Hungary on 17 August 2005, and scored his first international goal the following year in his sixth appearance, against Croatia. His goal against Serbia and Montenegro, on 16 June 2006, at the age of 18 years and 358 days, made him the youngest-ever scorer for Argentina at a FIFA World Cup. He has scored ten international hat-tricks, and has netted twice in a match on thirteen occasions. In a friendly against Estonia on 5 June 2022, Messi scored five goals in a match for Argentina for the first time. Out of all his opponents, Messi has scored the most against Bolivia, recording eleven goals in total.

Originally, it was awarded only to players from Europe and was widely known as the European Footballer of the Year award. In 1995, the Ballon d'Or was expanded to include all players of any origin that have been active at European clubs. The award became a global prize in 2007 with all professional footballers from around the world being eligible; additionally, coaches and captains of national teams were also given the right to vote, before reverting to just journalists in 2016.\nBetween 2010 and 2015, in an agreement with FIFA, the award was temporarily merged with the FIFA World Player of the Year, and was known as the FIFA Ballon d'Or. That partnership ended in 2016, and the award reverted to the Ballon d'Or, while FIFA also reverted to its own separate annual award, The Best FIFA Men's Player. In 2022, France Football modified the rules for the Ballon d'Or. The timing was changed so that awards were given not for achievements during a calendar year, but for a football season, and it was also determined that an international jury of specialized journalists, with one representative per country, from the top 100 in the latest FIFA Men's World Ranking would elect the winner of the award. UEFA co-organizes the Ballon d'Or gala since 2024, with France Football retaining the voting system and the Ballon d'Or name.\nLionel Messi won the Ballon d'Or a record eight times, followed by Cristiano Ronaldo with five. Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten each won the award three times, while Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, Franz Beckenbauer, Kevin Keegan, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Ronaldo have each won it twice. Rodri is the current holder of the award, having won its most recent edition in 2024.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe Ballon d'Or is widely regarded as football's most prestigious and valuable individual award. Prior to 2007, it was based exclusively on voting by football journalists and was generally known as the continental European Footballer of the Year award in English language and much international media. Even after 2007, it was usually identified with and referred to by that name because of its origin as a European award, until it was merged with the FIFA World Player of the Year award cementing its new worldwide claim. Stanley Matthews of England was the inaugural winner of the award. Liberia's George Weah, the only African recipient, became the first non-European to win the award in 1995, the year that rules of eligibility were changed and the Ballon d'Or was expanded to include all players of any origin, active at European clubs; two years later, Ronaldo of Brazil became the first South American to claim the award, and he is still the youngest winner ever at 21 years and 96 days old. The award became a global prize in 2007 with all professional footballers from clubs around the world being eligible; additionally, coaches and captains of national teams were also given the right to vote, before reverting to just journalists in 2016.\nLionel Messi holds the record for most Ballon d'Or wins with eight, while five-time winner Cristiano Ronaldo earned the most nominations with eighteen. Messi is the only player to win the award with three different teams and also the only one to win it while playing outside Europe, as well as being the player with the most podiums, finishing in the top-three a record fourteen times. Three players have won the award three times each: Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten. With seven awards each, Dutch, German, Portuguese and French players have won the second most Ballons d'Or, underneath Argentina in first with e\nFutbol Club Barcelona is a professional association football club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Founded by a group of Swiss, German, English and Catalan footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto \"M\u00e9s que un club\" (More than a club). The official Bar\u00e7a anthem is the \"Cant del Bar\u00e7a\", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espin\u00e0s. Unlike many other football clubs, the socis, who are the members and supporters of the club, own and operate Barcelona. It is the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of \u20ac800.1 million in the 2022\u201323 season.\nBarcelona played its first friendly match on 8 December 1899 against the English colony in Barcelona in the old velodrome in Bonanova. Initially, Barcelona played against other local clubs in various Catalan tournaments. In 1929, the club became one of the founding members of La Liga, Spain's first national league, and has since achieved the distinction of being one of only three clubs to have never been relegated, along with Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao. Barcelona is also the only European club to have played continental football every season since 1955. They hold a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, with matches between the two teams referred to as \"El Cl\u00e1sico\" (El Cl\u00e0ssic in Catalan). Matches against city rivals Espanyol are known as the \"Derbi barcelon\u00ed\".\nBarcelona has amassed various records in regional, domestic and continental tournaments since its founding. During the time the club played in regional competitions until the end of the Catalan championship in 1940, it won a record 23 titles from a possible 38. In 2009, Barcelona achieved an unprecedented sextuple by winning La Liga, the Copa del Rey, the UEFA Champions League, the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup in one calendar year. Additionally, Bar\u00e7a has won the coveted continental treble, consisting of La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League in the aforementioned 2009 and again 2015, becoming the first European club to have won the treble twice.\nBarcelona has signed several high-profile players, setting the world record in transfer fees on three occasions with the purchase of Johan Cruyff from Ajax in 1973, Diego Maradona from Boca Juniors in 1982 and Ronaldo from PSV Eindhoven in 1996. The club's players have received seven FIFA World Player of the Year awards, twelve Ballon d'Or awards, three UEFA Men's Player of the Year awards and eight European Golden Shoe awards.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nFC Barcelona won their first trophy in 1902 when they lifted the Copa Macaya, which was the predecessor to the Catalan Championship. The club won the Catalan Championship a record 23 times during the 40-year span of the tournament.\nWhen the national league was established in 1929, the importance of the regional league declined, and it was abandoned in 1940. From then on, Barcelona did not participate in regional competitions until the establishment of the Copa Catalunya in 1993, a cup they have won a record nine times.\nThey are the most successful football club in Spain, having won a total of 77 domestic titles: 27 La Liga, a record 31 Copa del Rey, a record 14 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, a record three Copa Eva Duarte and a record two Copa de la Liga.\nThe club is also one of the most successful clubs in international club football, having won 22 official trophies in total, 14 of which are UEFA competitions and 8 recognised by FIFA. Barcelona has won five UEFA Champions League titles, a record four UEFA Cup Winners' Cup titles, a record three Inter-Cities Fairs Cup titles (non-UEFA), a shared record of two Latin Cup titles, a shared record of five UEFA Super Cup titles and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. They are also second to Real Madrid in terms of overall official titles, with 99.\n\n\n=== Regional titles (35) ===\nCampionat de Catalunya:\nWinners (23) (record):\nCopa Macaya (1): 1902\nClub Internacional de F\u00fatbol Miami (lit. Miami International Football Club), better known as Inter Miami CF or simply Inter Miami (Spanish: Inter de Miami), is an American professional soccer club based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in the Miami metropolitan area.\nOn January 29, 2018, Major League Soccer (MLS) officially approved David Beckham's expansion team in Miami. The club garnered international attention prior to their founding because of club president and co-owner Beckham, and again in 2023 with the signing of Lionel Messi on a free transfer. Since the team began playing in the 2020 season, the club has signed several other high-profile players such as Blaise Matuidi, Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba, and Luis Su\u00e1rez.\nFollowing Messi's debut, the club won their first major trophy, the expanded 2023 Leagues Cup, which also qualified the team to the 2024 CONCACAF Champions Cup for the first time. In the 2024 season, Inter Miami secured their first Supporters' Shield. The team's estimated value according to Forbes is $1.03 billion as of 2024, ranking second in the league behind Los Angeles FC.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Expansion ===\nIn November 2012, Major League Soccer (MLS) commissioner Don Garber confirmed the league's renewed interest in placing an expansion franchise in Miami, after the Miami Fusion folded following the 2001 season. A Miami expansion team led by FC Barcelona and Marcelo Claure, a Bolivian businessman based in the city, announced an expansion bid in October 2008, with plans to begin play in 2011. In March 2009, the league and Barcelona announced that Miami was no longer a candidate due to local market conditions. Additionally, MLS expressed concerns about Miami's lack of fan interest in an MLS franchise, the fact that USL team Miami FC was not doing well, and the plan to use FIU Stadium relegating the team to a secondary tenant in a college football stadium with an artificial surface. However, Garber said that Miami would be an expansion target in the future. Claure later joined David Beckham's group of investors for the Miami expansion bid that was accepted by the league in 2014.\nWhen David Beckham, whose business manager Simon Fuller had the idea of giving him an option to purchase an expansion team at a price of $25 million when he joined the league in 2007, ended his playing career in April 2013, the MLS held discussions with Fuller about several expansion targets, including Miami. That same year, other investors, including Italian financier Alessandro Butini and Miami Dolphins owner Stephen M. Ross expressed interest in owning a Miami franchise as well. In 2013, Fuller and Beckham discussed plans to buy an MLS soccer team in Miami.\nIn 2013, when David Beckham was interviewed by CNN, he thanked Fuller for the groundbreaking MLS deal he had negotiated back in 2007 and specifically the clause that Fuller had insisted on inserting to the player's benefit: \"When I signed my contract six, seven years ago, my manager Simon Fuller actually got a clause in the contract that enabled me to have a franchise at the end of my playing career.\" In his December 2013 State of the League address, Garber had identified Beckham and Fuller as potential owners in Miami. Later that month, on December 17, Miami-Dade County commissioners voted unanimously to allow Mayor Carlos A. Gim\u00e9nez to negotiate with the Beckham-led group on a new stadium in downtown Miami.\nThe league announced that Beckham exercised his option on February 5, 2014, and that Miami Beckham United, the investment group led by Beckham, Fuller and Claure, would own an expansion franchise in Miami, assuming that financing for a stadium could be agreed upon. In presentations to officials and potential investors, the ownership group used \"Miami Vice\" and \"Miami Current\" as working titles for the club. After its initial stadium proposals fell through, Commissioner Garber reiterated in August 2014 that the expansion would not be approved until a downto\nEl Cl\u00e1sico (in Spanish, also in lowercase letters; Spanish pronunciation: [el \u02c8klasiko]) or El Cl\u00e0ssic (in Catalan, pronounced [\u0259l \u02c8klasik]), both meaning \"The Classic\", is the name given to any football match between rival clubs Barcelona and Real Madrid. Originally referring to competitions held in the Spanish championship, the term now includes every match between the clubs, such as those in the UEFA Champions League, Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a and Copa del Rey. It is considered one of sport's fiercest rivalries, and its matches have a global audience of hundreds of millions. A fixture known for its intensity, it has featured memorable goal celebrations from both teams, often involving mockery from both sides.\nThe fixture carries a large-scale political connotation, as Madrid is the capital and largest city of Spain and Barcelona is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia, which has an ongoing independence movement. The two clubs are often identified with opposing political positions, with Real Madrid viewed as representing Spanish nationalism and Barcelona viewed as representing Catalan nationalism. The two clubs are among the wealthiest and most successful football clubs in the world; in 2014 Forbes ranked Barcelona and Real Madrid the world's two most valuable sports teams. Both clubs have a global fanbase; they are the world's two most followed sports teams on social media.\nReal Madrid leads in head-to-head results in official competitive matches with 105 wins to Barcelona's 101 with 52 draws as of the match played on 26 October 2024. Along with Athletic Bilbao, they are the only clubs in La Liga to have never been relegated.\n\n\n== Rivalry ==\n\n\n=== History ===\n\nThe conflict between Real Madrid and Barcelona has long surpassed the sporting dimension, so much that elections to the clubs' presidencies have been strongly politicized. Phil Ball, the author of Morbo: The Story of Spanish Football, says about the match; \"they hate each other with an intensity that can truly shock the outsider\".\nAs early as the 1930s, Barcelona \"had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid\". In 1936, when Francisco Franco started the coup d'\u00e9tat against the democratic Second Spanish Republic, the president of Barcelona, Josep Sunyol, member of the Republican Left of Catalonia and Deputy to The Cortes, was arrested and executed without trial by Franco's troops (Sunyol was exercising his political activities, visiting Republican troops north of Madrid). During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to the fascist-like regime. In this period, Barcelona gained their motto M\u00e9s que un club (English: More than a club) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs. \nThere is an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939\u201375) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Most historians agree that Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atl\u00e9tico Aviaci\u00f3n and Madrid FC (which recovered its royal name after the fall of the Republic). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed CF Barcelona to succeed as \"Spanish team\" rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid were not particularly successful, winning two Copa del General\u00edsimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del General\u00edsimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atl\u00e9tico Aviaci\u00f3n were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. Events of the period include Real Madrid's 11\u20131 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del General\u00edsimo, where the Cat\nCristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro  (Portuguese pronunciation: [k\u027ei\u0283\u02c8tj\u0250nu \u0281\u0254\u02c8naldu] ; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo set numerous records for individual accolades won throughout his professional footballing career, such as five Ballon d'Or awards, a record three UEFA Men's Player of the Year Awards, four European Golden Shoes, and was named five times the world's best player by FIFA, the most by a European player. He has won 33 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, most appearances (30), assists (8), goals in the European Championship (14), international appearances (216) and international goals (133). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the most by an outfield player, and has scored over 900 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time.\nRonaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth \u20ac94 million (\u00a380 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions Leagues from 2014 to 2018, including La D\u00e9cima. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial \u20ac100 million (\u00a388 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player, and the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr.\nRonaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has earned more than 200 caps, making him history's most-capped male player. With 130 international goals, he is also the all-time top male goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in eleven major tournaments and scored in ten; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement would see him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020. The same tournament,\nThe Best FIFA Men's Player is an association football award presented annually by the sport's governing body, FIFA, since 2016, to honour the player deemed to have performed the best over the previous calendar year. The award was formerly known as the FIFA World Player of the Year, which was merged with France Football's Ballon d'Or in 2010 to become the FIFA Ballon d'Or in a six-year partnership.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2010, the FIFA World Player of the Year award combined with the Ballon d'Or to create the FIFA Ballon d'Or in a six-year partnership. FIFA presided over the FIFA Ballon d'Or after agreeing to pay \u00a313million for the merge of the two major player awards with France Football. The six editions of the FIFA Ballon d'Or were dominated by Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of their ongoing rivalry. In 2016, the Ballon d\u2019Or again lost its \"FIFA\" tag and would be voted for exclusively by journalists, while the FIFA World Player of the Year award \u2013 which ran from 1991 to 2009 \u2013 was resurrected, this time as The Best FIFA Men's Player.\nAccording to reports, FIFA's decision not to renew the deal was made in order to improve the organization's strained relationship with England's FA. This was based on the fact the annual ceremony was held in Z\u00fcrich \u2013 and new FIFA president Gianni Infantino wanted to move the next one to London.\nThe trophy was designed by Croatian artist Ana Barbi\u0107 Kati\u010di\u0107.\n\n\n=== Criteria and voting ===\nThe selection criteria for the players of the year are sporting performance, as well as general conduct on and off the pitch.\nThe votes are decided by media representatives, national team coaches, and national team captains. In October 2016, it was announced that the general public would also be allowed to vote. Each group has 25% of the overall vote.\n\n\n== Winners ==\n\n\n=== Wins by player ===\n\n\n=== Wins by country ===\n\n\n=== Wins by club ===\n\n\n== FIFA Player of the Year (including predecessors) ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Best FIFA Football Awards\nThe Best FIFA Women's Player\nFIFA World Player of the Year\nFIFA Ballon d'Or\nBallon d'Or\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Facebook website\nTop FIFA Football Players 2022\nThis list of most-liked Instagram posts contains the top 20 posts by number of likes on the photo and video-sharing social networking service Instagram.\nThe most-liked post as of September 2024 is of the Argentine footballer Lionel Messi and his teammates celebrating the 2022 FIFA World Cup win at Lusail Stadium in Lusail, Qatar, which has been liked by over 75.1 million different accounts.

This is the first season since the 2016 season to have no new expansion teams joining MLS; San Diego FC is scheduled to join the league in 2025. Inter Miami CF won the 2024 Supporters' Shield; the Columbus Crew are the reigning MLS Cup champions.\nPre-season matches ran from January 19 through February 17. The regular season began on February 21 and ended on October 19, with a pause from late July to late August for the 2024 Leagues Cup, which comprised all MLS and Liga MX teams. The 2024 MLS Cup playoffs began on October 22 and are scheduled to conclude with MLS Cup 2024 on December 7. MLS only sent 8 senior squads to the 2024 U.S. Open Cup as part of a compromise with the USSF that allowed most teams to be represented by MLS Next Pro teams.\nThis is the second season that Apple and MLS are part of a ten-year partnership for the broadcast and streaming rights to all MLS and Leagues Cup games, as well as select MLS Next and MLS Next Pro games, on the MLS Season Pass service within the Apple TV app.\nThe United States will be the host country for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. MLS clubs could qualify as a host nation club, with Inter Miami CF qualifying as the 2024 MLS Supporters' Shield champions. MLS clubs were also able to qualify through the 2021\u20132024 editions of the CONCACAF Champions Cup/CONCACAF Champions League.

The opening match was played on February 21, the earliest in league history; the regular season ended with Decision Day on October 19, which comprised simultaneous intra-conference matches. Matches were paused from July 25 to August 23 for the 2024 Leagues Cup, a knockout tournament that included teams from MLS and Liga MX. The league did not pause matches for the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica, which was played in the United States from June to July. Most regular season matches were played on Saturdays and Wednesdays at 7:30 p.m. local time.\nThe 29 teams were divided into two conferences: the Eastern and Western. The 15 teams in the East played a round-robin format with intra-conference teams and six matches against six opponents from the West. The 14 teams in the West played a round-robin with intra-conference teams, an additional one or two intra-conference matches, and six to seven matches against opponents from the East. The top nine teams in each conference advanced to the 2024 MLS Cup playoffs, which began with a wild card round for the eighth and ninth placed teams, and is followed by a best-of-three series that was introduced in 2023. The remaining matches are single-elimination, and culminate with the MLS Cup final on December 7.\nSeveral new rules were scheduled to be introduced for the 2024 season following trials in MLS Next Pro, including in-stadium announcements of video assistant referee decisions, a time limit for substitutions, and mandatory off-field checks for injured players. These initiatives were postponed by MLS due to an ongoing labor dispute with the Professional Soccer Referees Association, who organized a lockout of their referees. Replacement referees from outside the union, including former officials and those from lower-level leagues other than USL, were called in to officiate MLS matches.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest midfielders of all time, Xavi is renowned for his passing, vision, and positioning.\nHe was named in the FIFA FIFPro World XI six times from 2008 to 2013, and in the UEFA Team of the Year five times from 2008 to 2012. In 2020, Xavi was named in the Ballon d'Or Dream Team, a greatest all-time XI published by France Football. He is one of the few players to make over 1,000 professional career appearances.\nXavi joined La Masia, the Barcelona youth academy, at age 11 and made his first-team debut against Mallorca in August 1998, age 18. For Barcelona, he played 767 official matches, a former club record\u2014now held by Lionel Messi\u2014and scored 85 goals. Xavi is the first player in Barcelona\u2019s history to play 150 European and FIFA Club World Cup matches combined. With Barcelona, Xavi won eight La Liga titles and four UEFA Champions League titles. In 2015, he left Barcelona for Al Sadd, where he won four trophies before retiring in 2019.\nWith Spain, Xavi won the FIFA World Youth Championship in 1999, and the Olympic silver medal at the 2000 Olympics. He made his senior team debut in 2000 and he was capped 133 times for Spain. Xavi played an integral role in Spain's 2010 FIFA World Cup win, as well as their UEFA Euro 2008 and UEFA Euro 2012 victories. He was named Player of the Tournament at UEFA Euro 2008 and was named in the UEFA Euro Team of the Tournament in 2008 and 2012. With two assists in the UEFA Euro 2012 Final, Xavi became the first player to make assists in two separate European finals. After the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Xavi announced his retirement from international football.\nXavi came third place in the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year, followed by third place in the FIFA Ballon d'Or, in 2010 and 2011. In 2011, he was runner up to Messi for the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award. Xavi was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award in 2012. He was awarded the IFFHS World's Best Playmaker award four consecutive times from 2008 to 2011.\nAfter retirement, Xavi transitioned to management. In May 2019, he became manager of Qatar Stars League club Al Sadd, where he won seven trophies in less than three years. In November 2021, Xavi was appointed as manager at his former club Barcelona. He won the 2023 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a title and the 2022\u201323 La Liga title in his first full season as the club's manager.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nBorn in Terrassa, Barcelona, Catalonia, Xavi is a product of FC Barcelona's La Masia youth system, which he joined at the age of 11 from UFB J\u00e0bac Terrassa and Terrassa FC. His father, Joaquim, was a former player for Sabadell in the first division. His older brother, \u00d3scar, is a former player and manager. Xavi made his way through the youth and reserve teams and was a key member of Josep Maria Gonzalvo's Barcelona B team that won promotion to the Second Division.\nAlthough he was initially inspired by compatriot playmaker Pep Guardiola at Barcelona, as a child Xavi also watched a lot of English football, and looked up to midfielders John Barnes, Paul Gascoigne and Matt Le Tissier.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Barcelona ===\n\n\n==== 1998\u20132001: Beginnings ====\nXavi's progression through the teams earned him a first-team appearance in a Copa Catalunya match against Lleida on 5 May 1998 and he scored his first goal on 18 August 1998 in the 1998 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a against Mallorca. His debut in La Liga came against Valencia on 3 October 1998 in a 3\u20131 victory for Barcelona. Initially featuring intermittently both for the reserve and senior teams, Xavi scored the only goal in a 1\u20130 victory over Real Valladolid when Barcelona were in tenth position in the league. Sustained impressive performances meant that he became a key member of Louis van Gaal's title-winning\nFutbol Club Barcelona (Catalan pronunciation: [fub\u02c8b\u0254l \u02c8klub b\u0259\u027es\u0259\u02c8lon\u0259] ), commonly known as FC Barcelona and colloquially as Bar\u00e7a ([\u02c8ba\u027es\u0259]), is a professional football club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, that competes in La Liga, the top flight of Spanish football.\nFounded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto \"M\u00e9s que un club\" (\"More than a club\"). Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the third-most valuable football club in the world, worth $5.6 billion, and the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of \u20ac800.1 million. The official Barcelona anthem is the \"Cant del Bar\u00e7a\", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espin\u00e0s. Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and garnet stripes, hence nicknamed Blaugrana.\nDomestically, Barcelona has won a record 77 trophies: 27 La Liga, 31 Copa del Rey, 14 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, three Copa Eva Duarte, and two Copa de la Liga titles, as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions. In international club football, the club has won 22 European and worldwide titles: five UEFA Champions League titles, a record four UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, five UEFA Super Cups, a record three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cups. Barcelona was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2015, and occupies the ninth position on the UEFA club rankings as of May 2023. The club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches between the two teams are referred to as El Cl\u00e1sico.\nBarcelona is one of the most widely supported teams in the world, and the club has one of the largest social media following in the world among sports teams. Barcelona players have won a joint record twelve Ballon d'Or awards, with recipients including Johan Cruyff, as well as a record six FIFA World Player of the Year awards, with winners including Rom\u00e1rio, Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Ronaldinho and Lionel Messi. In 2010, three players who came through the club's youth academy\u2014Lionel Messi, Andr\u00e9s Iniesta and Xavi\u2014were chosen as the three best players in the world in the Ballon d'Or ranking, an unprecedented feat for players from the same football academy. Additionally, players representing the club have won a record eight European Golden Shoe awards.\nBarcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera Divisi\u00f3n that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid. In 2009, Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League, and also became the first European football club to win six out of six competitions in a single year, by also winning the Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup. In 2011, the club became European champions again, winning five trophies. This Barcelona team, which won fourteen trophies in just four years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time. By winning their fifth Champions League trophy in 2015 under Luis Enrique, Barcelona became the first European football club in history to achieve the continental treble twice.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1899\u20131922: Beginnings ===\n\nOn 22 October 1899, Swiss Hans Gamper placed an advertisement in Los Deportes declaring his wish to form a football club; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Sol\u00e9 on 29 November. Eleven players attended \u2013 Walter Wild (the first president of the club), Luis de Oss\u00f3, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsons \u2013 and Foot-Ball Club Barcelona w\nNeymar da Silva Santos J\u00fanior (English pronunciation: /Neymar/ ; born 5 February 1992), also known as Neymar J\u00fanior or simply Neymar, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a left winger, attacking midfielder or forward for Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal and the Brazil national team. Widely regarded as one of the best players of his generation, he is known for his skills, dribbling, playmaking, and finishing. Neymar is one of the few players to have scored at least 100 goals for three different clubs. He is the highest-scoring Brazilian in the UEFA Champions League and is also Brazil's all-time top goalscorer.\nNeymar made his professional debut with Santos in 2009. In 2011, he helped them win their first Copa Libertadores in nearly 50 years. In 2013, he joined Barcelona and became part of an attacking trio with Lionel Messi and Luis Su\u00e1rez, dubbed MSN. Winning the continental treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the Champions League in the trio's first season, Neymar was the joint-top goalscorer of the Champions League campaign and top goalscorer of the Copa del Rey. In his final season, Neymar reached 100 goals for Barcelona and set the record for most assists in a Champions League campaign. Motivated to assume focal responsibility, Neymar joined Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in 2017 for a transfer worth \u20ac222 million, making him the most expensive player ever. He largely contributed to PSG's continuation of Ligue 1 title dominance and PSG reaching its first Champions League final, whilst establishing himself as one of the club's highest ever scorers. Continuing injuries caused PSG to sell him in 2023 to Al Hilal for \u20ac90 million, a Saudi Pro League record transfer.\nAt 18, Neymar debuted for Brazil. He is the nation's all-time top goalscorer, with 79 goals in 128 matches. He won the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, winning the Golden Ball. In the 2014 FIFA World Cup, he was named in the Dream Team. He captained Brazil to their first Olympic gold medal in men's football in the 2016 Summer Olympics and won a silver medal at the 2012 edition. He helped Brazil finish runner-up to Argentina in the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica and was jointly awarded Best Player. In the 2022 World Cup, he became the third Brazilian player to score in three World Cups after Pel\u00e9 and Ronaldo. Neymar has won a record six Samba Gold awards.\nNeymar was named in the FIFA FIFPro World11, the UEFA Team of the Year twice, and the UEFA Champions League Squad of the Season three times. He finished third for the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2015 and 2017 and won the FIFA Pusk\u00e1s Award in 2011. SportsPro named Neymar the world's most marketable athlete in 2012 and 2013. In 2017, Time included him in its annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world. France Football ranked Neymar the world's third-highest-paid footballer of 2018. Forbes ranked him the world's third-highest-paid athlete of 2019, and dropped him to fourth in 2020.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHe was born in Mogi das Cruzes, S\u00e3o Paulo, to Neymar Santos Sr. and Nadine da Silva and had a Christian upbringing. He inherited his name from his father, who is a former footballer and became his son's advisor as Neymar's talents began to grow. Neymar comments on his father's role: \"My father has been by my side since I was little. He takes care of things, my finances and my family.\" Growing up, Neymar combined his love of futsal with street football. Neymar said that futsal had a massive influence on him growing up, helping him develop his technique, speed of thought and ability to perform moves in tight spaces.\nIn 2003, Neymar moved with his family to S\u00e3o Vicente, where he began playing for youth side Portuguesa Santista. Then, later in 2003, they moved to Santos, where Neymar joined Santos. With the success of his youth career and added income, the family bought their first property, a house next to Vila Belmiro, Santos' home stadium. Their quality of family life improved, as at age 15, Neymar was earning 10,000 r\nMessi (Russian: \u041c\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438; born 30 October 2015) is a pet cougar, model and Internet celebrity, owned by Russian couple Alexandr and Mariya Dmitriev. The Dmitrievs live with Messi in a two-story house on a large plot of land in Penza, Russia. Messi was adopted in 2016 from a local petting zoo. In 2017, the Dmitrievs started an Instagram account and a YouTube channel for Messi, which became popular by 2018 and continues to grow in subscribers.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMessi was born in a zoo at Saransk, Russia. He was one of three newborn cougars at the zoo to be named after professional football players formerly from FC Barcelona; Messi was named after Lionel Messi, and the other two were named Suarez and Neymar. The cubs were given these names because Saransk was one of several cities proposed to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. Messi was later sold to a petting zoo in Penza when he was three months old.\nMessi was significantly smaller than other typical male cougars, and as the species is not native to Russia, he could not be released into the wild. He had numerous other health problems as well, which rendered him unable to live in a zoo or wildlife sanctuary either. Furthermore, workers at the petting zoo originally planned to euthanize him.\nIn 2016, Alexandr and Mariya Dmitriev visited the Penza zoo and met Messi for the first time. The couple experienced \"love at first sight,\" and noticed Messi's exceptionally gentle personality. The Dmitrievs already had a sphynx cat named Kira but Aleksandr always wanted a big cat and so they considered bringing Messi home, offering a high price to the zoo authorities. \u201cSo we went to the zoo and started negotiations to buy Messi. We were surprised ourselves when they agreed\", Mariya Dmitriev recalled in an interview with Caters News.\n\n\n== Domestic life ==\nWhen they first purchased Messi, Alexandr and Mariya Dmitriev lived in a small studio apartment in Penza. The hallway of the apartment was modified and was designated as Messi's play area. Messi uses toys such as empty bottles and balls. Messi has a gentle and calm personality, and has never attacked a person or another animal. The Dmitrievs sometimes refer to him as \"kitten.\"\nMessi is regarded by his owners as similar to a domestic dog. He has been trained at a local dog training facility and has learned around ten formal commands. The Dmitrievs walk Messi regularly using a leash, coat, and harness through various environments.\nMessi is fed twice a day, and his diet mostly consists of raw turkey, beef, and chicken. It costs the Dmitrievs about 630 rubles per day to feed him. The couple regularly bathes Messi in a bathtub and sometimes trim his claws.\nMessi is house-broken (trained) and prefers to stay inside when there is snow outside.\n\n\n== Media attention ==\nIn 2017, the Dmitrievs started an Instagram account and YouTube channel for Messi, both called \"I_am_puma\". Pictures and videos published to these social media accounts show various aspects of daily life with the cougar. Messi's social media accounts quickly grew in popularity; by January 2018, the Instagram account already had almost 150,000 followers and over 50 million views. The Instagram account has more than 1.5 million followers; the YouTube channel has more than 2.49 million subscribers. Mariya is the manager of the social media accounts.\n\n\n== Relations with other animals ==\nMessi also shared the property and attention of the Dmitrievs with a 10-year-old female cheetah named Ichel, who was given to the Dmitrievs by a circus trainer in December 2019 and revealed in January 2020. Ichel died of lung cancer in April 2020.\nThe Dmitrievs own another female cheetah, named Gerda, who has a calm and gentle personality similar to Messi's. Messi becomes anxious when Gerda is present but relations between the two animals are improving. Gerda has her own YouTube channel, \"I_am_cheetah\".\nThe Dimitrievs also had another feline in their house, a female Sphinx cat (hairless breed) called Kir\nIn top-level association football competitions, 25 players have scored 500 or more goals in both club and international football, according to research by the IFFHS, first published in 2007. Taking into account competitions of all levels, 77 players have reached the milestone, according to research by the RSSSF, an organisation described by German newspaper Der Spiegel as a \"Wikipedia of football statistics\". Hungarian Imre Schlosser was the first to reach the 500-goal mark, doing so in 1927 shortly before his retirement. Nine players have accomplished the feat at a single club: Josef Bican (Slavia Prague), Jimmy Jones (Glenavon), Jimmy McGrory (Celtic), Joe Bambrick (Linfield), Lionel Messi (Barcelona), Gerd M\u00fcller (Bayern Munich), Pel\u00e9 (Santos), Fernando Peyroteo (Sporting CP), and Uwe Seeler (Hamburg). Of these nine, Messi scored the most, with 672 goals between his debut in 2004 and his departure in 2021.\nFIFA, the international governing body of football, has never released a list detailing the highest goalscorers and does not keep official records; in 2020, it recognised Bican, an Austrian-Czech dual international who played between the 1930s and the 1950s, as the record scorer with an estimated 805 goals, although CNN, the BBC, France 24, and O Jogo all acknowledge that Bican's tally includes goals scored for reserve teams and in unofficial international matches. UEFA, the governing body for European football, ranks him as the leading all-time goalscorer in European top-flight leagues with 518 goals, narrowly ahead of Hungarian Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s. RSSSF credits Bican with 948 goals, a tally which includes goals scored in winter tournaments, as well as when selected to represent regional and city teams, and the Football Association of the Czech Republic claims a total of 821. Spanish newspapers Marca and Sport state that both Bican and Pel\u00e9 scored 762 goals. It is difficult for statisticians and media outlets to determine which goals to include; Bican once walked out of a gala held in his honour by the IFFHS after the organisation had excluded war-time goals from his tally, although it later recognised the 229 goals he had scored during the period.\nMedia outlets around the world such as Sky Sports, ESPN, and Globo Esporte argue that, for Brazilian forward Pel\u00e9 and players of his era, friendly matches were highly important fixtures and held more resonance, and the tallies accumulated should be included, while journalist Hugh McIlvanney once described them as mere \"profit-making excursions\" that bore little \"relevance to Pel\u00e9's reality as a great player\", and Jonathan Liew stated that many of the friendlies were \"against up-country teams or down-at-heel invitational sides\". When Argentinian forward Messi was reported to have broken the record for most goals for a single club (644 for Spanish club Barcelona), Pel\u00e9's former club Santos denied the claim, releasing a statement saying 448 of Pel\u00e9's goals scored in friendlies had been uncounted, and arguing that many of the goals came against \"the best teams of all time\", statements Pel\u00e9 agreed with by publicly changing his overall tally to 1,283 on Instagram. When reporting the statistics of Messi, Barcelona argued that because Bican and Pel\u00e9, as well as Erwin Helmchen and Abe Lenstra, scored the majority of their goals in leagues which were not played at a national level, their tallies should not be counted, while goals scored during war-time matches, in lower-tiers, and regional divisions, by players such as Bican, Ferenc De\u00e1k, Pusk\u00e1s, Seeler, M\u00fcller, T\u00falio Maravilha, and Robert Lewandowski, are also questioned.\nIn 2021, Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo was reported to have broken the record when he scored his 760th goal, although it was widely acknowledged it was impossible to quantify with certainty as statistics from previous generations are often disputed, as highlighted by football journalist Jonathan Wilson and Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport's editor Ivan Zazzaro\nThe 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or Gala was the inaugural year for FIFA's awards for the top football players and coaches of the year. The gala is a continuation of the FIFA World Player Gala and a result of merging the FIFA Men's World Player of the Year award with the Ballon d'Or, previously created and presented by France Football to the top men's player in Europe. The awards ceremony took place on 10 January 2011 in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. The three finalists for each category were announced on 6 December 2010.\nLa Masia, the FC Barcelona academy, achieved a record breaking honor in becoming the first youth academy ever to have all three finalists for the Ballon d'Or in one same year, with Lionel Messi, Andr\u00e9s Iniesta and Xavi. Messi won the award, his second consecutive Ballon d'Or victory.\nMarta won the FIFA Women's World Player of the Year award, her fifth in a row.\nJos\u00e9 Mourinho, Portuguese manager of Real Madrid and previously of Internazionale, was the first winner of the men's FIFA World Coach of the Year award in 2010. The women's version of the award was won by Germany head coach Silvia Neid.\n\n\n== Winners and nominees ==\n\n\n=== FIFA Ballon d'Or ===\n\nThe following twenty players were also in contention for the award:\n\n\n=== FIFA Women's World Player of the Year ===\n\nThe following seven players were also in contention for the award:\n\n\n=== FIFA World Coach of the Year for Men's Football ===\n\n\n=== FIFA World Coach of the Year for Women's Football ===\n\n\n=== FIFA Pusk\u00e1s Award ===\n\n\n=== FIFA/FIFPro World XI ===\n\n\n=== FIFA Presidential Award ===\n Desmond Tutu\n\n\n=== FIFA Fair Play Award ===\n Haiti women's national under-17 football team\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFrance Football Official Ballon d'Or page\nThe FIFA Ballon d'Or (\"Golden Ball\") was an annual association football award presented to the world's best men's player from 2010 to 2015. Awarded jointly by FIFA and France Football, the prize was a merger of the FIFA World Player of the Year award and the Ballon d'Or, the two most prestigious individual honours in world football. Unlike the Ballon d'Or awarded by France Football, the FIFA Ballon d'Or, was not awarded based on votes from international journalists, but votes from national team coaches and captains, who selected the players they deemed to have performed the best in the previous calendar year.\nThe six editions of the FIFA Ballon d'Or were dominated by Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of their ongoing rivalry.\nMessi, who played for Barcelona, won the inaugural Ballon d'Or in 2010 and went on to win three in a row, after his wins in 2011 and 2012. Ronaldo, who played for Real Madrid, won successive awards in the next two years. The final FIFA Ballon d'Or was presented to Messi in 2015. Its awarding bodies subsequently ended their partnership; for 2016, France Football reintroduced the previous format of the Ballon d'Or, while FIFA created The Best FIFA Men's Player award.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHistorically, the leading individual awards in association football were the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award. The original Ballon d'Or, also known as the European Footballer of the Year award, had been awarded by the French publication France Football since 1956. The FIFA World Player of the Year award was presented by FIFA, the sport's governing body, from 1991.\nFrom 2005, the winners of the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award were identical each year. Following the introduction of a global Ballon d'Or format in 2007, France Football and FIFA opted to merge the two awards. The creation of the FIFA Ballon d'Or was subsequently announced during the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. The inaugural award was presented that same year to the Argentine Lionel Messi.\nAfter a six-year partnership, France Football and FIFA terminated the joint award. Lionel Messi had received the final FIFA Ballon d'Or. For historical purposes, both awarding bodies regard the six editions of the FIFA Ballon d'Or as a continuation of their respective awards.\n\n\n=== Voting ===\nThe winners of the FIFA Ballon d'Or were chosen by international journalists and the coaches and captains of the national teams under FIFA's jurisdiction. In a system based on positional voting, each voter was allotted three votes, worth five points, three points and one point, and the three finalists were ordered based on total number of points. Voters were provided with a shortlist of 23 players from which they could select the three players they deemed to have performed the best in the previous calendar year.\n\n\n== Winners ==\n\n\n=== Wins by player ===\n\n\n=== Wins by country ===\n\n\n=== Wins by club ===\n\n\n== FIFA Ballon d'Or Prix d'Honneur ==\nIn 2013, Brazilian forward Pel\u00e9 was given an honorary Ballon d'Or, having won three FIFA World Cups with Brazil but never an individual award from FIFA, as during his playing career only Europe-based players were eligible to win the original Ballon d'Or.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBallon d'Or\nFIFA World Player of the Year\nThe Best FIFA Football Awards\nFIFA FIFPRO World 11\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website by FIFA\nOfficial website by France Football", "metadata": {"title": "Lionel Messi", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi"}}
