In 2021, \u00d6zil joined Fenerbah\u00e7e on a free transfer; after his contract with the club was terminated in 2022, he signed with \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir, before retiring in 2023.\nA German international for over nine years, \u00d6zil holds the record for the most German National Team Player of the Year awards (5). He made his senior debut for the Germany national team in 2009 at age 20, and appeared in five major tournaments.

He was deployed a midfielder and wore 17 as his squad number, after starting as a playmaker and central attacking midfielder in the place of the suspended Lincoln in DFL-Ligapokal matches against Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern Munich. Upon making the first team at Schalke, he was described as \"the next big thing\". However, soon after declining an offer from Schalke 04, claiming that a yearly salary of \u20ac1.5 million would not be enough, he eventually fell out with club management and moved on to Werder Bremen in January 2008. This led to Mirko Slomka, the then-Schalke manager, claiming that \u00d6zil would not play another match for Schalke.\n\n\n=== Werder Bremen ===\nOn 31 January 2008, \u00d6zil moved to Werder Bremen for a reported fee of \u20ac5 million, signing a contract with the German club until 30 June 2011. Other than Werder Bremen, Hannover 96 and VfB Stuttgart were reportedly interested as well in binding \u00d6zil to their respective clubs, however did not want to pay such a high transfer fee.

He played in twelve games throughout the second half of the season, six times playing in the starting formation, becoming second with Werder Bremen in the Bundesliga at the end of the 2007\u201308 season.\n\nAlthough Bremen failed to get going in their 2008\u201309 Bundesliga season, eventually finishing a disappointing tenth, \u00d6zil managed to make a significant impact in most games and came away with a respectable three goals and 15 assists that highlighted his\nAmine G\u00fcl\u015fe \u00d6zil (born 30 April 1993) is a Turkish-Swedish actress, model and beauty pageant titleholder born and raised in Sweden.

It covered a period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012.\nReal Madrid began the season finishing runners-up in the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a to Barcelona, losing 5\u20134 on aggregate. The team then went on to produce a magnificent season, winning a record 32nd La Liga title and setting a number of league records, including 100 points amassed in a single season, a total of 121 goals scored, a goal difference of +89, 16 away games won, and 32 wins overall. They also competed in the UEFA Champions League for the 15th successive season, losing in the semi-finals to Bayern Munich on penalties (after a 3\u20133 aggregate tie) in heartbreaking fashion. Madrid entered the Copa del Rey as the defending champions, but lost 3\u20134 on aggregate in the quarter-finals to Barcelona. In the same season, Cristiano Ronaldo became the fastest player to reach 100 goals scored in Spanish league history. In reaching 101 goals in 92 games, Ronaldo surpassed Real Madrid legend Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s, who scored 100 goals in 105 matches. Ronaldo set a new club mark for individual goals scored in one year (60) and became the first player ever to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season.\nThe season has been often termed by some newspapers as \"La Liga de los R\u00e9cords\" (Spanish for \"The League of the Records\") as Real Madrid broke several long-standing La Liga records, the most prominent being the highest number of points in a single La Liga season. Their total of 100 was one point better than the previous record set by Barcelona in the 2009\u201310 season. Real Madrid also recorded the most goals in a league season with 121, surpassing the previous record held by the Real Madrid side that scored 107 goals during the 1989\u201390 season.\n\n\n== Season overview ==\n\n\n=== Pre-season ===\nReal Madrid commenced their summer transfer activity on 9 May, signing Turkish central midfielder Nuri \u015eahin for six seasons from Borussia Dortmund on a transfer reported to be worth \u20ac10 million. Versatile Turkish midfielder Hamit Alt\u0131ntop was signed for four seasons on a free transfer from Bayern Munich on 19 May, but was discovered to have a prolapsed disc on 23 June, undergoing a successful operation four days later. The club announced on 21 May that veteran Polish goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek's contract would not be renewed; he subsequently retired. Former Castilla winger Jos\u00e9 Callej\u00f3n was brought back after three seasons at Espanyol for a reported fee of \u20ac5 million on 23 May.\nReal Madrid fired Director General Jorge Valdano on 25 May after a strained relationship over sporting decisions between him and manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. President Florentino P\u00e9rez supported Mourinho's request to \"be able to manage the team with autonomy\" in response to tensions during the previous season's winter transfer window and a public feud regarding Karim Benzema following a 1\u20131 draw against Almer\u00eda. Valdano was reported to be paid \u20ac3.5 million to release him from the remaining two years on his contract and was replaced by Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel S\u00e1nchez. Mourinho subsequently became head of football operations in addition to his role as head coach with former player and special adviser to P\u00e9rez Zinedine Zidane as the new director of football for the first team.\nReal Madrid continued their transfer activity on 27 June, signing teenage French central defender Rapha\u00ebl Varane from Lens for six seasons on a reported \u20ac10 million transfer. On 1 July, Royston Drenthe and David Mateos returned from their loan spells at H\u00e9rcules and AEK Athens, respectively, while Emmanuel Adebayor returned to Manchester City following a six-month loan. Mateos was loaned out ten days later to Real Zaragoza with Zaragoza having an option to purchase the player permanently at the end of the season, and Drenthe was loaned to Everton late on the final day of the transfer window.

The hashtag campaign was launched by social activist Ali Can, who encouraged those affected by racism in Germany to use it in their tweets to draw attention to the extent of racist harassment and racist attacks. Since then, this hashtag has been used thousands of times in Germany. International media also reported on this hashtag, which is based on the #MeToo movement. \"MeTwo\" was chosen to draw attention to the fact that one can also have two nationalities, and Can cited \u00d6zil saying \"I have two hearts, one German and one Turkish\" as an influence.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nAli Can opened the \"hotline for concerned citizens\" to fight racism as a result of the rise of right-wing populist forces in Europe. Later, with the hashtag \"MeTwo\", he wanted to draw attention to the increasing racism of everyday life. After the Mesut \u00d6zil debate on racism, who raised serious accusations against the DFB and civil society, the hashtag gained wide recognition. The hashtag was shared a thousand times and met with a broad response in national and international media.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nThe Germany national football team (German: Deutsche Fu\u00dfballnationalmannschaft) represents Germany in men's international football and played its first match in 1908. The team is governed by the German Football Association (Deutscher Fu\u00dfball-Bund), founded in 1900. Between 1949 and 1990, separate German national teams were recognised by FIFA due to Allied occupation and division: the DFB's team representing the Federal Republic of Germany (commonly referred to as West Germany in English between 1949 and 1990), the Saarland team representing the Saar Protectorate (1950\u20131956) and the East Germany team representing the German Democratic Republic (1952\u20131990). The latter two were absorbed along with their records; the present team represents the reunified Federal Republic. The official name and code \"Germany FR (FRG)\" was shortened to \"Germany (GER)\" following reunification in 1990.\nGermany is one of the most successful national teams in international competitions, having won four FIFA World Cups (1954, 1974, 1990, 2014), tied with Italy, and only one less than the most successful team, Brazil. Having won three European Championships (1972, 1980, 1996) Germany is second behind Spain, the record holder in that international competition with four. Germany won also a Confederations Cup in 2017. They have also been runners-up at the European Championship three times, and four times at the World Cup, with a further four third-place finishes at the World Cup. East Germany won Olympic Gold in 1976. Germany was the first, and is one of only two nations to have won both the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Women's World Cup (the other being Spain). By combined World Cups, Germany stands as the most successful football nation in history with six World Cups \u2013 four for the men's team and two for the women's. At the end of the 2014 World Cup, Germany earned the second highest Elo rating of any national football team in history, with 2,223 points. Germany is also the only European nation that has won a FIFA World Cup in the Americas.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years (1899\u20131942) ===\n\nOn 18 April 1897, an early international game on German soil was played in Hamburg when a selection team from the Danish Football Association defeated a selection team from the Hamburg-Altona Football Association, 5\u20130.\nBetween 1899 and 1901, prior to the formation of a national team, there were five international matches between Germany and English selection teams, which are today not recognised as official by either nation's football association (in part because England fielded their amateur side, which was an overflow or B team). All five matches ended in large defeats for the Germany teams, including a 12\u20130 loss at White Hart Lane in September 1901. Eight years after the establishment of the German Football Association (DFB) in 1900, the first official match of the Germany national football team was played on 5 April 1908, against Switzerland in Basel, with the Swiss winning 5\u20133. A follow-up to the earlier series between England Amateurs and Germany occurred in March 1909 at Oxford's White House Ground and resulted in Germany's largest official defeat to date: 9\u20130 (this time, the match was recognised and recorded as official by the DFB but not by the FA, again due to the amateur side being fielded). These early confrontations formed the beginning of the rich rivalry between the two teams: one of the longest and most enduring international rivalries in football.\nJulius Hirsch was the first Jewish player to represent the Germany national football team, which he joined in 1911.  Hirsch scored four goals for Germany against the Netherlands in 1912, becoming the first German to score four goals in a single match.\n\nGottfried Fuchs scored a world record 10 goals for Germany in a 16\u20130 win against Russia at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm on 1 July, becoming the top scorer of the tournament; his international record was not surpassed until 2001 when Australia's Archie Thompson \nThe 2014 FIFA World Cup final was the final match of the 2014 World Cup, the 20th edition of FIFA's competition for national football teams. The match was played at the Maracan\u00e3 Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on 13 July 2014, and was contested by Germany and Argentina. The event comprised hosts Brazil and 31 other teams who emerged from the qualification phase, organised by the six FIFA confederations. The 32 teams competed in a group stage, from which 16 teams qualified for the knockout stage. En route to the final, Germany finished first in Group G, with two wins and a draw, after which they defeated Algeria in the round of 16, France in the quarter-final and Brazil, by a score of 7\u20131, in the semi-final. Argentina finished first in Group F with three wins, before defeating Switzerland in the round of 16, Belgium in the quarter-final and the Netherlands in a penalty shoot-out in the semi-final. The final was witnessed by 74,738 spectators in the stadium, as well as over a billion watching on television, with the referee for the match being Nicola Rizzoli from Italy.\nGonzalo Higua\u00edn missed a chance to score for Argentina in the first half when he was one-on-one with Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, and Benedikt H\u00f6wedes failed to give Germany the lead shortly before half-time when his shot struck the goalpost. Lionel Messi had an opportunity to score when he was one-on-one with Neuer shortly after half time, but his low shot went wide of the goal. On 71 minutes, Thomas M\u00fcller was through on goal following a build-up involving Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle and Mesut \u00d6zil, but he failed to control the ball and lost it to Argentina's goalkeeper, Sergio Romero. With the match goalless after 90 minutes, it went to extra time, in the second period of which Germany broke the deadlock. Mario G\u00f6tze, who had come on as a substitute shortly before the end of normal time, received Sch\u00fcrrle's cross from the left on his chest before volleying a left-footed shot into the net to secure a 1\u20130 victory for Germany.\nGermany's win was their fourth World Cup title and the first since German reunification, as well as the first World Cup win by a European team in the Americas. G\u00f6tze was named the man of the match, and Messi was awarded the Golden Ball as FIFA's outstanding player of the tournament. Germany's manager, Joachim L\u00f6w, labelled his side's win as the culmination of a project that had begun ten years previously under his predecessor J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, and praised his team's spirit. His Argentine counterpart, Alejandro Sabella, thought his team had been unlucky to lose, and called his players \"warriors\". Germany failed to defend their trophy at the subsequent 2018 World Cup in Russia, becoming the third successive World Cup holders to be eliminated in the group phase after defeats against Mexico and South Korea.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe 2014 FIFA World Cup was the 20th edition of the World Cup, FIFA's football competition for national teams, held in Brazil between 12 June and 13 July 2014. Brazil qualified for the finals automatically as tournament hosts, and 203 teams competed for the remaining 31 spots through qualifying rounds organised by the six FIFA confederations and held between June 2011 and November 2013. In the finals, the teams were divided into eight groups of four with each team playing each other once in a round-robin format. The two top teams from each group advanced to a knock-out phase. The defending champions from the 2010 World Cup were Spain, who had achieved three successive victories in major tournaments, having also won Euro 2008 and Euro 2012. Spain were eliminated in the group phase in the 2014 event.\nGermany had won the title three times before as West Germany \u2013 in 1954, 1974 and 1990. Argentina had two titles, in 1978 and 1986. The two sides had met each other six times previously in the World Cup, including in the 1986 final, which Argentina won 3\u20132, and the 1990 final, which West Germany won 1\u20130.

Born in Germany, he captains and plays for the Turkey national team. He is well renowned as a free kick specialist, known for being effective from a multitude of angles and distances.\n\u00c7alhano\u011flu began his career at German second division club Karlsruher SC in 2010 and moved to top-flight side Hamburger SV two years later, spending another season back at his first club on loan. His performance in his first Bundesliga season earned him a \u20ac14.5 million transfer to Bayer Leverkusen in 2014. He played for three seasons there, totalling 28 goals in 115 official appearances. In 2017, \u00c7alhano\u011flu signed for Milan for an initial \u20ac20 million fee, before joining city rivals Inter on a free transfer in the summer of 2021.\n\u00c7alhano\u011flu represents Turkey at international level, from under-16 level onwards. He made his senior debut in 2013, and was part of their squad at the UEFA European Championship in 2016, 2020 and 2024.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Karlsruher SC ===\nBorn in Mannheim, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany, \u00c7alhano\u011flu began his career with Karlsruher SC in the 2. Bundesliga in February 2012 after he was promoted from the under-19 team, although they were relegated to the 3. Liga at the end of his first season. He signed a four-year deal to join Hamburger SV in the 2012 summer transfer window, being loaned back to Karlsruhe for another season. In that season on loan, he helped the team win the third division and return to the second tier.\n\n\n=== Hamburger SV ===\n\u00c7alhano\u011flu made his Hamburg and Bundesliga debut on 11 August 2013, as the team opened the season with a 3\u20133 away draw at Schalke 04. He started the match, and was replaced by Dennis Aogo after 74 minutes. He scored his first goals for the club on 31 August, in a 4\u20130 home win over Eintracht Braunschweig; after replacing goalscorer Rafael van der Vaart in the 79th minute, he scored a minute later and then netted again with a free kick.\nOn 5 February 2014, \u00c7alhano\u011flu signed a two-year extension to his Hamburg contract, to keep him at the club until 2018. On 20 February, he scored a 41-yard free kick, against Borussia Dortmund in a 3\u20130 win, which ended Hamburg's bad run. As he saw no defensive wall or teammates to pass, he struck a shot that swerved viciously to find the back of the net. A delighted \u00c7alhano\u011flu said afterwards: 'I hit the free-kick the same way I do in training all the time. I'm delighted that I pulled it off!'. He was sent off for the first time in his career on 22 March, for his second booking in the 53rd minute of a 1\u20130 defeat away to VfB Stuttgart.\nIn his only full season at Hamburg, the team finished in 16th, and won a play-off against Greuther F\u00fcrth on away goals to maintain their honour as the only team to feature in every season of the top flight.\n\n\n=== Bayer Leverkusen ===\n\nHamburg were initially unwilling to sell \u00c7alhano\u011flu to other German teams, but their purchase of Pierre-Michel Lasogga from Hertha Berlin made such an exception no longer financially viable. On 4 July 2014, he left Hamburg for league rivals Bayer Leverkusen, signing a five-year contract for a transfer fee of \u20ac14.5 million. His actions leading up to the transfer caused some controversy, including taking sick leave from Hamburg; he justified the leave by saying that he was stressed by aggression from fans, including vandalism of his car. He also criticised Hamburg's director Oliver Kreuzer, accusing him of betrayal. The move was later criticised by Son Heung-min, as a response to \u00c7alhano\u011flu calling his former Leverkusen teammate's transfer to Tottenham Hotspur \"badly advised\".\nHe made his debut for the club on 19 June, starting in a 3\u20132 away win at Copenhagen in the first leg of a UEFA Champions League qualification play-off. Four days later, he played his first league game for his new club, a 2\u20130 win away to Borussia Dortmu\nEmile Smith Rowe (born 28 July 2000) is an English professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Premier League club Fulham.\nHe was a highly regarded youth player at Arsenal, whilst also playing a key part for England in their successful FIFA U-17 World Cup campaign in 2017. Smith Rowe's professional breakthrough came in 2018, as he made an immediate impression at senior level for Arsenal, scoring several times in his first games.\nIn January, Smith Rowe moved to Bundesliga's RB Leipzig on loan, playing just 3 times due to a recurring groin injury, despite this, the German club lobbied unsuccessfully for a permanent move. In July 2019, Smith Rowe returned to rehab at Arsenal for the first half of the season. In January 2020, Smith Rowe moved to Huddersfield Town on loan, playing a key part in keeping them up in the Championship.\nUpon returning from loan, Smith Rowe established himself as a key player for Arsenal under Mikel Arteta. In July 2021, he was given the number 10 shirt vacated by Mesut \u00d6zil, and signed a long-term contract. That following season, Smith Rowe scored ten goals in the league, and was shortlisted for the Premier League Young Player of the Season and the PFA Young Player of the Year awards.\nSmith Rowe has represented every age bracket for England at youth levels. He made his senior debut against Albania on 12 November 2021, in a 5\u20130 FIFA World Cup qualification victory.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Arsenal ===\n\n\n==== Early years ====\nSmith Rowe joined Arsenal's Hale End Academy in 2010 at the age of ten, after playing for South London-based team Glebe. He made his first appearance for the Under-23s in 2016\u201317, at the age of 16. He continued in the Under-23s during the 2017\u201318 season, making 10 appearances for the side, recorded 2 assists and 1 goal. He signed his first professional contract with the club on 31 July 2017.\nSmith Rowe signed a new long-term professional contract with Arsenal on 31 July 2018, when he was described by head coach Unai Emery as having \"lots of potential\". The length of the contract was not disclosed by Arsenal, but it was reported to be five years.\nSmith Rowe made his Arsenal first-team competitive debut on 20 September 2018 against Vorskla Poltava in the UEFA Europa League, coming on as a second-half substitute for Alex Iwobi. His appearance was the first Arsenal professional debut by a player born in the 2000s. He scored after starting the following Europa League match against Qaraba\u011f in a 3\u20130 victory for Arsenal, becoming the youngest Arsenal goalscorer in a competitive match since Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in 2011, and the first player born after 2000 to score for the London club. He scored his first goal at the Emirates in a 2\u20131 victory over Blackpool in the EFL Cup.\n\n\n==== 2018\u20132020: Loans to RB Leipzig and Huddersfield Town ====\nOn 31 January 2019, he joined RB Leipzig on loan until the end of the 2018\u201319 season. After signing, Leipzig discovered that Smith Rowe was not fully recovered from a groin injury. Leipzig manager Ralf Rangnick said: \"He will not be fully training with us in the next two to three weeks\". Due to his injury issue, he only played a total of 28 minutes in three substitute appearances during his time at Leipzig.\nOn 10 January 2020, Smith Rowe joined EFL Championship club Huddersfield Town on loan until the end of the 2019\u201320 season. Huddersfield manager Danny Cowley responded to supporters' wishes for Smith Rowe to play more minutes by stating: \"We have to be very protective of him which none of us like. I actually boo myself when I take him off, because it's not something I want to do.\" On 1 February, Smith Rowe scored his first goal for Huddersfield in a 3\u20132 league defeat to Fulham. Smith Rowe's performance at Huddersfield caught the eye of many. In particular, in his final home appearance for the club, he scored the winning goal in the 86th minute against West Brom that would eventually help Huddersfield to secure EFL Championship safety.\nMario G\u00f6tze  (German pronunciation: [\u02c8ma\u02d0\u0281i\u032fo \u02c8\u0261\u0153ts\u0259]; born 3 June 1992) is a German professional footballer who plays for Bundesliga club Eintracht Frankfurt and the Germany national team. Although his favoured position is that of a playmaker, G\u00f6tze has also played as a left winger or false nine.\nHe played for Borussia Dortmund between 2009 and 2013, winning the Bundesliga title in 2010\u201311 and the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal double in 2011\u201312, and was a member of the team which reached the 2013 UEFA Champions League Final. In April 2013, a \u20ac37 million bid from Bayern Munich triggered a release clause in G\u00f6tze's contract, making him the second-most expensive German player at the time, behind Mesut \u00d6zil. He spent three seasons with the club where he won a further three league titles, two DFB-Pokal trophies and a winners' medal in each of the FIFA Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup. He then returned to Dortmund in 2016, where he added another DFB-Pokal title and a DFL-Supercup to his name.\nG\u00f6tze was first selected for the Germany national football team in 2010, at the age of 18. He was included in the squad for UEFA Euro 2012 and, two years later, scored the winning goal in the 2014 FIFA World Cup final.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Borussia Dortmund ===\n\n\n==== Early career ====\nG\u00f6tze is a product of Dortmund's youth academy, first entering the club as an eight-year-old. He made his Bundesliga debut on 21 November 2009 in a scoreless draw against Mainz 05, coming on as a substitute for Jakub B\u0142aszczykowski in the 88th minute. During the winter break of the 2009\u201310 Bundesliga season, Dortmund manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp promoted G\u00f6tze to the first team. He finished the 2009\u201310 season with five appearances. G\u00f6tze took his chance and was an important player in Dortmund's Bundesliga-winning squad of the 2010\u201311 season. He finished 2010\u201311 season with eight goals in 41 appearances. In 2010, German Football Association's then technical director Matthias Sammer described G\u00f6tze as \"one of the best talents Germany has ever had.\"\nHe played in the 2011 German Super Cup' losing to Schalke 04. In January 2012, G\u00f6tze was diagnosed with a hip injury; cartilage in G\u00f6tze's hip had inflamed under stress.\n\nOn 27 March 2012, G\u00f6tze signed a new contract with Borussia Dortmund, keeping him at Dortmund until 2016. His contract, however, contained a release clause from the club, triggered by a fixed transfer fee of at least \u20ac37 million. G\u00f6tze spoke about his contract extension, saying, \"Everyone knows how comfortable I feel in Dortmund. The club are far from finished with their recent resurgence. And I want to be part of this development.\"\nIn April 2012, G\u00f6tze made the squad for the first time since his hip injury but was an unused substitute against rivals Schalke 04. He played his first game since his hip injury when he came on as a substitute against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach.\nG\u00f6tze won the Bundesliga with Borussia Dortmund in 2012 as Dortmund set a Bundesliga record by earning the most points in a season with 81, a record later broken by Bayern Munich in 2012\u201313. G\u00f6tze also won the DFB-Pokal with Dortmund (5\u20132) against rivals Bayern Munich in 2012. G\u00f6tze finished the season with seven goals in all competitions.\n\n\n==== 2012\u201313 season ====\nG\u00f6tze kicked off his season by losing the 2012 German Super Cup. On the first day of the 2012\u201313 season, he came on as a substitute and scored the winner against Werder Bremen in a 2\u20131 win for Dortmund. On 19 December, he netted a hat-trick, powering Dortmund to a 5\u20131 defeat of Hannover 96 in the third round of the DFB-Pokal.\n\nG\u00f6tze provided an assist and netted a goal in Dortmund's 3\u20130 second leg defeat of Shakhtar Donetsk on 5 March 2013, completing a 5\u20132 aggregate victory over the Ukrainian champions as Dortmund progressed to the quarter-finals of the Champions League. The result meant that Dortmund had advanced to the quarter-finals for the first time in 15 years. G\u00f6tze was ruled out of the final against Bayern Munich at Wemb\nFlorentino P\u00e9rez Rodr\u00edguez (Spanish pronunciation: [flo\u027een\u02c8tino \u02c8pe\u027ee\u03b8 ro\u02c8\u00f0\u027ei\u0263e\u03b8]; born 8 March 1947) is a Spanish businessman and the president of football club Real Madrid, as well as chairman and CEO of Grupo ACS, a civil engineering company.\nHe began his professional career in the private sector in 1971 and was a member of the Spanish Union of the Democratic Center and the secretary-general of the Spanish Democratic Reformist Party, from 1979 to 1986. He has been president of Real Madrid from 2000 to 2006 and from 2009 onwards. During his first six years as president, he implemented the Gal\u00e1cticos policy of bringing the world's best players to Real Madrid. In his first four seasons in charge, he bought Lu\u00eds Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona, Zinedine Zidane for a then-world record transfer fee, Ronaldo, and David Beckham. From the 2003\u201304 season to the 2005-06 season, the club did not win a trophy, leading P\u00e9rez to resign in 2006. He assumed office again in 2009 and he restarted the Gal\u00e1cticos policy. He brought Kak\u00e1 and Xabi Alonso to the club, as well as Cristiano Ronaldo for a then-world record transfer fee, and Karim Benzema, a talented rising star from Ligue 1. In domestic competitions, Real Madrid competed against a Barcelona team led by Pep Guardiola and an Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid team led by Diego Simeone. The club was coached by managers such as Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti, and Zinedine Zidane. Over the course of eleven seasons from 2013 to 2024, the club won six Champions League titles. Real Madrid has won a record 7 Champions League titles during his presidency.\nFlorentino Perez is the most successful president in the history of Real Madrid, winning 36 titles during his presidency, surpassing Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, who won 32.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nP\u00e9rez attended the Polytechnic University of Madrid. P\u00e9rez joined the Union of the Democratic Centre party in 1979, serving as a member of Madrid's city council. In 1986, P\u00e9rez ran as a candidate for the Democratic Reformist Party (Partido Reformista Democr\u00e1tico) and served as its secretary-general.\nIn 1993, P\u00e9rez was named vice chairman of OCP Construcciones. After the merger of OCP with Gines y Navarro into Actividades de Construcci\u00f3n y Servicios, S.A. (ACS) in 1997, he became chairman of the new company. As of 2018, P\u00e9rez leads Grupo ACS, Spain's largest construction company, and has an estimated net worth of US$2.5 billion.\n\n\n== Real Madrid presidency ==\n\n\n=== First term ===\nIn 1995, P\u00e9rez ran as a candidate for the presidency of Real Madrid against Ram\u00f3n Mendoza and Santiago G\u00f3mez Pintado. Despite obtaining the highest number of signatures to endorse his candidacy, he came in second place.\nIn 2000, P\u00e9rez again ran as a candidate for presidency of Real Madrid, which he won with more than 55% of the votes, beating the incumbent president at that time, Lorenzo Sanz. Sanz assumed that the recently won UEFA Champions Leagues in 1998 and 2000 would give him enough credit to win the elections, but P\u00e9rez's campaign, once again highlighting the financial problems of the club and claims of mismanagement by the previous boards, proved otherwise. P\u00e9rez's promise to bring in Lu\u00eds Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona also played a decisive role in the elections. P\u00e9rez was later re-elected in 2004 with 94.2% of the total votes.\nFigo also marked the start of P\u00e9rez's policy to bring one of the best football players in the world to Real Madrid each season. The strategy was initially known as that of Zidanes y Pavones in which superstars would play alongside the Canteranos, but the players were soon popularly referred to as Gal\u00e1cticos. In 2001, Zinedine Zidane was signed from Juventus for a then-world record transfer fee of \u20ac77.5 million. Zidane was followed up by Ronaldo in 2002, David Beckham in 2003, Michael Owen in 2004, and Robinho for a short time in 2005. Initially, P\u00e9rez's policy worked to great success, as each new Gal\u00e1ctico had the squad built around them, and the team had a good balan\nThe 2016\u201317 season was Arsenal's 25th in the Premier League, their 91st consecutive season in the top flight of English football and their 100th season in the top flight overall. The club participated in the Premier League, FA Cup, EFL Cup and the UEFA Champions League.\nIn the league, despite being in the title race in the first half of the season, their form collapsed in the second half of the season, with Arsenal finishing outside the top four of the Premier League for the first time since the 1995\u201396 season. In Europe, despite topping their group, Bayern Munich inflicted Arsenal's heaviest defeat in a two-legged European tie with a 10\u20132 aggregate defeat, with increasing criticism towards manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, as well as calls for change within the Arsenal hierarchy. Despite the loss of form and heavy fan disapproval towards the end of the season, Arsenal won the FA Cup for a record 13th time, beating Chelsea 2\u20131 in the final. The victory saw manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger become the most successful manager in FA Cup history with seven wins.\nThe season covers the period from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2017.\n\n\n== Review ==\n\n\n=== Pre-season ===\nArsenal made its first summer signing prior to start of the current season on 25 May, with the acquisition of Swiss midfielder Granit Xhaka for a reported \u00a330 million fee. Xhaka's involvement in UEFA Euro 2016 and his subsequent desire to secure his club future beforehand enabled Arsenal to uncharacteristically complete a signing before the formal opening of the transfer window. In the following weeks, the Gunners activated the release clause of Leicester City forward Jamie Vardy. However, they failed in their attempts to bring Vardy from the Premier League champions, with the England forward instead opting to sign a contract extension with the East Midlands club. Manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger came under fire for failing to secure the transfer, and fans were outraged further when Arsenal signed young forward Takuma Asano from Sanfrecce Hiroshima, due to the relative unproven nature of the forward's capabilities. Arsenal made its third summer signing on 22 July, signing Bolton Wanderers' Player of the Year Rob Holding. He joined for a reported \u00a32 million fee from the League One side. Arsenal played Lens later that day in their first pre-season game, with a late chipped goal from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain earning Arsenal a hard-fought 1\u20131 draw. Arsenal then flew out to California for two more pre-season fixtures, against the MLS All-Stars and Chivas Guadalajara. Wenger would state that Per Mertesacker would not be on the tour, after picking up an injury against Lens. He would later confirm that Mertesacker had surgery in his native Germany, and would be out for \"months\". Arsenal beat the All Stars 2\u20131 on 28 July (July 29 BST), with a Joel Campbell penalty and a Chuba Akpom close-range finish coming either side of a goal from Didier Drogba. Arsenal concluded their tour on 31 July (1 August BST) with a 3\u20131 win over Chivas. Oxlade-Chamberlain and Akpom scored their second pre-season goals each, with the opener scored by Holding. Wenger confirmed that the injury to Mertesacker meant he'd need to sign a replacement ideally before the season's opener against Liverpool on 14 August, as talks of incoming transfers intensified.\n\n\n=== August ===\n\nDespite the absence of key players, Wenger gave positive news ahead of a trip to Scandinavia; Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Aaron Ramsey would join the team for the tour and would likely be fit for the season's opener against Liverpool. Gabriel also returned after missing the US tour with tonsillitis.\nArsenal's pre-season continued in Norway, against Viking FK. The Gunners were 8\u20130 winners; Joel Campbell continued his pre-season form with a double, while Chuba Akpom added his third goal in as many pre-season games. Alex Iwobi also scored a late double, with the remaining goals coming from Theo Walcott, Santi Cazorla (although the Spaniard missed a third-minute penalty), and an own goal fr\nThe knockout stage of the 2010 FIFA World Cup was the second and final stage of the World Cup, following the group stage. It began on 26 June with the round of 16 matches, and ended on 11 July with the final match of the tournament held at Soccer City, Johannesburg, in which Spain beat the Netherlands 1\u20130 after extra time to claim their first World Cup. The top two teams from each group (16 in total) advanced to the knockout stage to compete in a single-elimination style tournament. A third place match was included and played between the two losing teams of the semi-finals.\nIn the knockout stage (including the final), if a match was level at the end of 90 minutes, two periods of extra time (15 minutes each) would be played. If the score was still level after extra time, the match would be decided by a penalty shoot-out.\nAll times listed are South African Standard Time (UTC+2)\n\n\n== Qualified teams ==\nThe top two placed teams from each of the eight groups qualified for the knockout stage.\n\n\n== Bracket ==\n\n\n== Round of 16 ==\n\n\n=== Uruguay vs South Korea ===\nUruguay vs South Korea was the first match in the Round of 16. The match was held at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth before a low crowd of 30,597. Uruguay won the match 2\u20131. Uruguay's two goals came from Luis Su\u00e1rez, the second of which broke a 1\u20131 deadlock in the 80th minute. Su\u00e1rez's first was scored when Diego Forl\u00e1n made a low cross from the left that was not dealt with by the Korean defence, leaving Su\u00e1rez to score at the back post. Uruguay subsequently adopted a defensive posture and Korea had more chances to score. Eventually, Lee Chung-yong equalised in the 68th minute, scoring a headed goal following a free kick. Despite Korea then having chances to win the match, it was Su\u00e1rez who scored Uruguay's winner in the 80th minute with a curling strike from the edge of the 18-yard box that went in off the inside of the post. Suarez's goal was regarded as one of the tournament's best. Korea missed more good chances in the final minutes of the game, giving Uruguay victory and passage to the quarter-finals for the first time since 1970, where they would face Ghana. After the match, the Uruguayan coach \u00d3scar Tab\u00e1rez attributed his team's successful run to the number of players with experience at top-level overseas clubs. Korean coach Huh Jung-moo claimed his side \"controlled\" the match and that Uruguay's goals were \"lucky\".\n\n\n=== United States vs Ghana ===\nThe match between the United States and Ghana was played on 26 June 2010 at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg. The match was watched by 19 million Americans, making it the most watched association football match in American television history. The match was won by Ghana in extra time after Asamoah Gyan broke a 1\u20131 deadlock. Kevin-Prince Boateng scored the opening goal of the match for Ghana in the fifth minute. The goal followed an error by Ricardo Clark, who lost the ball to the Ghanaians in midfield. Boateng took the ball to the edge of the penalty area, beating United States goalkeeper Tim Howard with a low left-footed shot. Landon Donovan equalised with a penalty kick in the 62nd minute, which was awarded after Jonathan Mensah fouled Clint Dempsey. The United States had chances to win the game thereafter but were unable to get past Ghana goalkeeper Richard Kingson. The match thus went to extra time. In the third minute, Gyan latched onto a high long ball, chesting it down and holding off two defenders before scoring the winner. After the match, Ghana's coach Milovan Rajevac hailed his side's achievement in becoming one of the \"best eight teams in the world\", but regretted the number of players that would miss the quarter-final match against Uruguay because of injury or suspension. The president of the United States Soccer Federation, Sunil Gulati, lamented the team's failure to make the quarter-finals and thereby further raise the profile of the sport in the United States.\n\n\n=== Germany vs England =\nDaniel Nii Tackie Mensah Welbeck (born 26 November 1990) is an English professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club Brighton & Hove Albion. He is known for his link-up play and ability as a false nine.\nWelbeck made his way through the youth teams at Manchester United before making his senior debut in 2008 and scoring in the process. He was with United when they won the 2008\u201309 League Cup and the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup before being sent on loan spells with Preston North End and Sunderland. From the 2011\u201312 season, Welbeck was a regular figure in the Manchester United first team. He was transferred to Arsenal in September 2014 for a \u00a316 million fee. In August 2019, Welbeck joined Watford, following his release by Arsenal at the end of the previous season, before joining Brighton & Hove Albion a year later.\nWelbeck made his debut for the England national team in March 2011 in a 1\u20131 friendly draw against Ghana. He scored his first senior international goal on 2 June 2012, the only goal in a friendly victory over Belgium. Welbeck has gone on to represent England at UEFA Euro 2012, the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2018 FIFA World Cup, earning 42 caps.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nWelbeck was born on 26 November 1990 in Manchester to Ghanaian parents and was raised in the Longsight area of the city.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Manchester United ===\nWelbeck was first spotted by Manchester United as a six-year-old. At eight years old, he impressed with local team Fletcher Moss Rangers, and was finally picked up by the Manchester United youth academy. He joined United during the 2005\u201306 season, making his debut for the club's under-18 team on 8 April 2006 in a league match against Sunderland. He then came on as a substitute in the next match, before being named as an unused substitute in the team's last two matches of the season. The following season, he made a further 28 appearances for the under-18s, scoring nine goals, including eight appearances and one goal in the FA Youth Cup, in which he helped the team to reach the final, despite being two years younger than some of the other players. He was not handicapped despite suffering from Osgood\u2013Schlatter disease, and was making rapid progress, despite his pneumonia.\nWelbeck signed his first trainee contract in July 2007, and started the 2007\u201308 season in the under-18 team, but was quickly promoted to the reserve team, making a number of substitute appearances. Then, in January 2008, he was called up to the first team for the trip to Saudi Arabia to play Al-Hilal in Sami Al-Jaber's testimonial match. Welbeck made his debut in that match on 21 January 2008, coming on as a 65th-minute substitute for Anderson. Welbeck had the chance to snatch a draw for United when he was brought down in the penalty area in the final minute, but he put the penalty kick over the bar.\nHe joined the first-team squad partway through the 2007\u201308 season, and made his competitive debut for the Manchester United first team on 23 September 2008, starting up front in a 3\u20131 home win against Middlesbrough in the League Cup Third Round. Welbeck's Premier League debut was made on 15 November 2008, coming on as a 63rd-minute substitute for Park Ji-sung against Stoke City. He marked his debut with a curling 30-yard shot into the top right corner for United's fourth goal in a 5\u20130 win. He started in the 2009 League Cup Final at Wembley Stadium on 1 March 2009, in which United beat Tottenham Hotspur 4\u20131 on penalties after a 0\u20130 extra-time draw.\nOn 23 September 2009, Welbeck scored his first goal of the 2009\u201310 season, the only one of the match in the League Cup Third Round against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Welbeck made his UEFA Champions League debut in a 1\u20130 home defeat to Be\u015fikta\u015f in November 2009. The following month he signed a new contract, keeping him at Manchester United until 2013.\n\nOn 25 January 2010, Welbeck became Alex Ferguson's son Darren Ferguson's first signing as Preston North End manager since h\nThe 2015\u201316 season was Arsenal's 24th season in the Premier League and 90th consecutive season in the top flight of English football. The club entered the season as the FA Cup holders, and participated in the Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup, Community Shield and the UEFA Champions League. Arsenal were favourites to get their first league title since 2004, having been league-leaders towards the New Year, but a loss of form which included successive defeats to Manchester United and Swansea City saw them lose ground on eventual winners Leicester City, although they recovered to get 2nd, their highest finish in 11 years. Arsenal's attempt of winning a third consecutive FA Cup was unsuccessful, losing to Watford at the quarter-final stage, as well as exiting in the League Cup fourth round to Sheffield Wednesday. In Europe, Arsenal recovered from a poor start to qualify for the knockout-stages, but they were defeated in both legs against Barcelona. The season covers the period from 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2016.\n\n\n== Review ==\n\n\n=== August ===\n\nArsenal began their season with the Community Shield against local rival side Chelsea. The Gunners won the match 1\u20130, following a goal by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who scored via a drive into the top corner. The trophy was Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's 15th in 18 years of being in charge of Arsenal, and presented Wenger with his first win against a side managed by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho after 13 attempts. Soon after, Arsenal began their 24th Premier League season at home to West Ham United, and inspired by the signing of goalkeeper Petr \u010cech, many believed Arsenal to be title contenders for the first time in 11 years. The club's solid pre-season form, however, fizzled out as they failed to win in their first two home games, with a 2\u20130 defeat to West Ham on the opening weekend, leaving them third-bottom, and a goalless draw with Liverpool, although Aaron Ramsey was falsely ruled offside for an early goal. With two tight wins at Crystal Palace and Newcastle United, Arsenal went into September with seven points. Arsenal did not make additional signings after \u010cech, leaving manager Wenger to come under fire from fans and critics.\n\n\n=== September ===\n\nArsenal started September with a nervy 2\u20130 win over Stoke City at the Emirates, with Theo Walcott and Olivier Giroud scoring. Between the Stoke clash and a trip to struggling champions Chelsea, Arsenal faced Dinamo Zagreb away in the Champions League. Despite appearing the stronger side, Arsenal slumped to a shock 2\u20131 defeat, with under-performing striker Giroud being sent off for two yellow cards. The week got worse as Arsenal lost 2\u20130 at Stamford Bridge, with Santi Cazorla (two yellows) and Gabriel being sent off, the latter incorrectly shown red by Mike Dean for a clash with Diego Costa in which the latter assaulted Laurent Koscielny. Gabriel's ban was reduced from three games to one, but Gabriel, Costa, Chelsea and Arsenal were all fined for player misconduct, with Costa suspended for three games. With the Chelsea incident resolved, Arsenal faced a tough League Cup tie with North London arch-rival club Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. Mathieu Flamini became an unsung hero with a brace, the second of which was a volley from 20 yards, both goals on the other side of a Calum Chambers own goal. Arsenal, full of confidence after eliminating their rivals, visited the only unbeaten team in the league at the time, Leicester City, who were one point and one place above Arsenal. Despite a brace from Jamie Vardy, Walcott and Giroud scored either side of three goals from S\u00e1nchez, who ended a run of seven games without a goal. Arsenal ended their month on a sour note, however, as errors from second-choice goalkeeper David Ospina saw Arsenal lose 3\u20132 to Olympiacos at home in the Champions League, meaning they were bottom of their group with successive games against in-form Bayern Munich coming up.\n\n\n=== October ===\n\nArsenal started October on a high, as three early goals\u2014two fro\nThe 2018\u201319 season was Arsenal's 27th season in the Premier League, 102nd overall season in the top flight and 93rd consecutive season in the top flight of English football. The club participated in the Premier League and the UEFA Europa League, and participated in the FA Cup and the EFL Cup.\nThis was Arsenal's first season in 22 years without manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. For the second consecutive season, Arsenal qualified for the UEFA Europa League, improving on the last season's result and reaching the final where they were defeated by rivals Chelsea. This was the club's first and only full season under manager Unai Emery.\n\n\n== Review ==\n\n\n=== Pre-season ===\nArsenal began their off-season by completing some squad alterations. They started by announcing the departure of club captain Per Mertesacker, who retired to become their new academy coach. After six years at the club, Santi Cazorla's departure was also announced upon the expiry of his contract. Further, Petr \u010cech, H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn, Mohamed Elneny, Mesut \u00d6zil, Granit Xhaka and Ainsley Maitland-Niles all received new squad numbers, with the latter two also extending their contracts with the club.\nAfter completing a clearout of backroom staff to coincide with their new club-model following the retirement of long-term manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Spaniard Unai Emery was appointed as the club's new head coach.\nThe first signing of the Emery era was Swiss right-back Stephan Lichtsteiner, who joined on a free transfer from Juventus on 5 June. The club then signed German goalkeeper Bernd Leno from Bayer Leverkusen two weeks later, for a rumored fee of \u00a319.2 million. Meanwhile, club stalwart Jack Wilshere departed following the expiry of his contract, after 17 years at the club, and Greek central defender Sokratis joined the club from Borussia Dortmund for \u00a314.8 million on 8 July. Shortly thereafter, the club signed defensive midfielder Lucas Torreira from Sampdoria for a reported fee of \u00a326.4 million on 10 July, and announced the transfer of Matteo Guendouzi from Lorient for a rumoured \u00a37 million a day later.\n\n\n=== August ===\nOn 7 August 2018, Alisher Usmanov announced that he would accept an offer from American businessman Stan Kroenke to buy his 30% stake in Arsenal for \u00a3550 million, in a deal that would allow Kroenke to take full control of the club.\nArsenal's first game was against reigning champions Manchester City on 12 August. They lost the game 2\u20130 after goals by Raheem Sterling and Bernardo Silva. The following game was against London rivals Chelsea on 18 August. Arsenal lost again, this time 3\u20132 though they had chances to get more from the game, courtesy of goals by Pedro, \u00c1lvaro Morata and Marcos Alonso while Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Alex Iwobi scored for Arsenal.\nArsenal's first win was a 3\u20131 victory against West Ham United on 25 August. Marko Arnautovi\u0107 scored first to put West Ham in front, but Nacho Monreal equalised minutes later, and an own goal by Issa Diop and a late goal by Danny Welbeck won the game for Arsenal.\n\n\n=== September ===\nArsenal's first game in September and 4th game in the Premier League, was a 3\u20132 victory over Cardiff City on 2 September. Shkodran Mustafi scored the opening goal from a Granit Xhaka corner, but V\u00edctor Camarasa equalised just before the break. After the restart, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored his first goal of the season to give Arsenal the lead. Cardiff equalised again from a Danny Ward header, but Alexandre Lacazette ensured the victory with a thumping shot to give Arsenal another three points.\nAfter the international break, Arsenal were the visitors against Newcastle United. After a dull first half, Granit Xhaka scored a stunning free kick to give Arsenal the lead. Mesut \u00d6zil doubled the advantage on his 200th appearance for Arsenal. Late on, Ciaran Clark scored in stoppage-time to give Newcastle hope. In the end, it was not enough as Arsenal won their third consecutive game 2\u20131.\nArsenal started the Europa League with a 4\u20132 victory over V\nThe knockout stage of the 2014 FIFA World Cup was the second and final stage of the competition, following the group stage. It began on 28 June with the round of 16 and ended on 13 July with the final match of the tournament, held at Est\u00e1dio do Maracan\u00e3, Rio de Janeiro. The top two teams from each group (16 in total) advanced to the knockout stage to compete in a single-elimination tournament. A third-place match was played between the two losing teams of the semi-finals.\nIn all matches in the knockout stage, if the score was level at the end of 90 minutes, two 15-minute periods of extra time were played. If the score was still level after extra time, the match was decided by a penalty shoot-out.\nAll times listed below are in Bras\u00edlia official time (UTC\u22123).\n\n\n== Qualified teams ==\nThe top two placed teams from each of the eight groups qualified for the knockout stage.\n\n\n== Bracket ==\n\n\n== Round of 16 ==\n\n\n=== Brazil vs Chile ===\n\nThe two teams had met in 68 previous matches, including three times in the FIFA World Cup knockout stage, all won by Brazil (1962, semi-finals: 4\u20132; 1998, round of 16: 4\u20131; 2010, round of 16: 3\u20130).\nBrazil opened the scoring when Thiago Silva flicked on a corner kick before David Luiz turned the ball into the net with his thigh. While replays suggested that Chilean defender Gonzalo Jara may have had the last touch, FIFA later confirmed that the goal was scored by Luiz, not Jara. Chile equalised when Hulk lost possession after a throw-in in his own half; Eduardo Vargas stole the ball and passed to Alexis S\u00e1nchez to score.\nIn the second half, Hulk's goal was disallowed as Howard Webb adjudged that the player used his arm in bringing down the ball and gave him a yellow card instead. Chances were few after that with Brazil dominating possession and Hulk forcing Claudio Bravo into a decent save, and the match went to extra time. The best chance of extra time came in the last seconds as Mauricio Pinilla's shot hit the crossbar. In the resulting penalty shootout, the score was tied 2\u20132 after four rounds, with Brazil goalkeeper J\u00falio C\u00e9sar saving from Pinilla and S\u00e1nchez, while Willian missed and Hulk's shot was saved by Bravo. In the fifth round, Neymar scored his penalty, meaning Chile had to score, but Jara's shot hit the inside of the post. Brazil advanced to the quarter-finals to face Colombia.\nThe result meant that in all four World Cups where Chile qualified for the knockout stage, they were eliminated by Brazil.\n\n\n=== Colombia vs Uruguay ===\nThe two teams had met in 38 previous matches, including in the 1962 FIFA World Cup group stage, won 2\u20131 by Uruguay. Their most recent meetings were in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, with both teams winning at home, Colombia winning 4\u20130 and Uruguay winning 2\u20130. Uruguayan striker Luis Su\u00e1rez was not in the line-up because of a nine-game ban imposed by FIFA due to a biting incident involving Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during their final group stage match. This was the first (and only) match of Uruguay in Maracan\u00e3 Stadium in a World Cup since the historical Maracanazo.\nColombia won 2\u20130 with both goals from James Rodr\u00edguez, the first in the 28th minute, where he controlled Abel Aguilar's headed ball on his chest before volleying left-footed from 25 yards out with the ball going in off the underside of the crossbar, which won the 2014 FIFA Pusk\u00e1s Award later in the year.\nThe second goal, in the 50th minute, was a close-range shot from six yards out after receiving the ball from a header by Juan Cuadrado on the right.\nColombia progressed through to the quarter-finals for the first time in their history, where they would face Brazil.\t\n\n\n=== Netherlands vs Mexico ===\n\nThe two teams had met in six previous matches, including in the 1998 FIFA World Cup group stage, a 2\u20132 draw. Mexico midfielder Jos\u00e9 Juan V\u00e1zquez was suspended for the match due to accumulation of yellow cards.\nGiovani dos Santos opened the scoring for Mexico early in the second half with a left-fo\nThe 2013\u201314 season was the 110th season in Real Madrid's history and their 83rd consecutive season in La Liga, the top division of Spanish football. It covered a period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014, and ended with the club clinching a unique European cup double.\nThe team competed for a record 33rd La Liga title and entered the UEFA Champions League for the 17th successive season, competing for a record 10th title. They also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32. Real Madrid's shirt sponsor for this season was Emirates, having replaced Bwin.com. The club's major signing of the summer window was the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur for \u20ac100 million.\nIn new manager Carlo Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league standings on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atl\u00e9tico Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals. By that time, Los Blancos had already secured the Copa del Rey \u2013 against rivals Barcelona \u2013 in April, with Bale scoring the winner. The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after 12 years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5\u20130 on aggregate in the semi-finals. In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 4\u20131 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as \"La D\u00e9cima\". Real's attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals.\nThis season was the first since 2005\u201306 without Argentinian striker Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, who left to join Napoli, and just four years without fellow German midfielder Mesut \u00d6zil who departed for Arsenal F.C.\n\n\n== Season overview ==\n\n\n=== Pre-season ===\nReal Madrid started the summer without a manager, as Jos\u00e9 Mourinho departed to manage Chelsea. On 25 June, Carlo Ancelotti was officially announced as Real Madrid's new manager for the next three seasons. He appeared for his first press conference in front of the media on 26 June.\nOn 3 June, Real Madrid announced its first signing of the season by exercising the buyback option for Dani Carvajal from Bayer Leverkusen for \u20ac6.5 million.\nOn 10 June, Real Madrid announced the signing of former youth system loanee Casemiro from S\u00e3o Paulo for \u20ac6 million.\nOn 27 June, Real Madrid announced its first major signing of the season with Isco from M\u00e1laga for \u20ac30 million.\nOn 10 July, Real Madrid agreed a contract extension with defender Nacho, keeping him in the club for four more years.\nOn 11 July, Real Madrid announced the sale of Jos\u00e9 Callej\u00f3n to Napoli for \u20ac10 million.\nOn 12 July, Asier Illarramendi from Real Sociedad became the fourth signing for Real Madrid for \u20ac32.2 million, penning a six-year deal. He was the fifth player in the first team that won the 2013 UEFA European Under-21 Championship last June with Spain.\nOn 21 July, Real Madrid began its pre-season campaign against English Second Division side AFC Bournemouth. This was Carlo Ancelotti's first game in charge, with Madrid winning 6\u20130. Cristiano Ronaldo scored a brace and Sami Khedira, Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, Casemiro and \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda chipped in the other goals. Real Madrid also announced the sale of Ra\u00fal Albiol to Napoli for \u20ac11 million.\nOn 24 July, Real Madrid played its second pre-season match against Lyon, coming from two goals down to draw 2\u20132 with goals from Casemiro and \u00c1lvaro Morata. Madrid also agreed on a contract extension with Jes\u00e9 which would keep him with at the club for four additional years.\nOn 25 July, Real Madrid agreed a contract extension with Denis Cheryshev, keeping him with the club for four more years.\nOn 27 July, Real Madrid faced Paris Saint-Germain, Ancelotti's former club, winning 1\u20130, with Kar\nFenerbah\u00e7e Spor Kul\u00fcb\u00fc (Turkish: [fe\u02c8n\u00e6\u027ebaht\u0283e], Fenerbah\u00e7e Sports Club), commonly known simply as Fenerbah\u00e7e or colloquially as Fener, is a professional football club based in Kad\u0131k\u00f6y, Istanbul, Turkey. They represent the men's football department of the Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K. sports club and compete in the S\u00fcper Lig, the top flight of Turkish football. In domestic football, Fenerbah\u00e7e have won a record 28 national championship titles and seven Turkish Cups. In international football, the club has won the Balkans Cup, which was the first non-domestic trophy won by a Turkish club.\nDeriving its name from the neighbourhood of the same name, Fenerbah\u00e7e won the most top-flight titles prior to the establishment of the S\u00fcper Lig in 1959. They hold the joint-record for the longest uninterrupted top-flight streak and have won the most points in S\u00fcper Lig history. Fenerbah\u00e7e have played their home games at \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Saraco\u011flu Stadium since 1908.\nOne of the most widely supported clubs in Turkey, the club also boasts sizeable international support on social media. Fenerbah\u00e7e are part of the \"Big Three\" alongside Galatasaray and Be\u015fikta\u015f: the club's long-standing rivalry with Galatasaray consists of Turkish domestic football's biggest match, the K\u0131talararas\u0131 Derbi.\nIn its 101st year of 2008; with a market value of $2 billion, it surpassed Manchester United to become the world's most valuable club. Also, in March 2008, Fenerbah\u00e7e's record application was accepted by Guinness World Records, which envisages Fenerbah\u00e7e to have the highest number of medal and trophy achievements on the planet with its 9 departments entirely, a total of 1134 cups and medals.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Initiative, Prototype team (1906) ===\n\nThe founder and first president of Fenerbah\u00e7e, Nurizade Ziya Song\u00fclen, was first introduced to the football in England, where he went for higher education after graduating from Istanbul Saint-Joseph College in 1903, and was inspired by the football teams in this country, where the sport of football was born. When he returned to the country in 1906, the first thing he did was to establish a football team in his hometown, Istanbul in June 1906. He first contacted his friends in the Kad\u0131k\u00f6y district and then Enver Yetiker, the literature teacher at the school he graduated from, and conveyed his intention to establish a football team to them and made them an offer. Nurizade Ziya Bey, who received a positive response to his offer, initially only went to training with the first Fenerbah\u00e7e football team in history, the prototype of which was created in June 1906. Because the team could only be completed as an 11-person team in the spring of 1907, the official foundation date of the club.\n\n\n=== Early years (1907\u20131959) ===\n\nFenerbah\u00e7e were officially founded in 3 May 1907 in Kad\u0131k\u00f6y, Istanbul, by local men Ziya Song\u00fclen, Ayetullah Bey and Necip Okaner. This group founded the club secretly in order to keep a low profile and not get into any trouble with the strict Ottoman rule, so strict that the Sultan Abdul Hamid II forbade the Turkish youth to set up a club or engage in the game of football played by the English families that was watched in envy. The three men came together and concluded that Kad\u0131k\u00f6y was in desperate need of its own football club, where locals would get a chance to practise the game of football. Ziya Song\u00fclen was elected the first president of the club, Ayetullah Bey became the first general secretary and Necip Okaner was given the post of general captain. The lighthouse situated on the Fenerbah\u00e7e cape was a big influence on the design of the club's first crest, which sported the yellow and white colors of daffodils around the lighthouse. The kits were also designed with yellow and white stripes. The crest of the club was changed in 1914 when Hikmet Topuzer redesigned the badge after Ziya Song\u00fclen had changed the colors to yellow and navy in the fall of 1908, still seen today. Fenerbah\u00e7e's activities were kept in secrecy until a le\nMartin \u00d8degaard (born 17 December 1998) is a Norwegian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for and captains both Premier League club Arsenal and the Norway national team. Considered one of the best midfielders in the world, he is known for his technique, dribbling ability, vision and range of passing.\n\u00d8degaard began his senior club career at age 15 in 2014, playing for Str\u00f8msgodset; he set the Tippeligaen record for its youngest goalscorer, and in 2015, signed for Real Madrid in a transfer worth an initial \u20ac4 million (Kr. 35 million), where he set the club record for its youngest player. After enduring sporadic playing time, \u00d8degaard joined Eredivisie clubs Heerenveen and Vitesse, and La Liga club Real Sociedad, on successive loans between 2017 and 2019; \u00d8degaard won the Copa del Rey with Real Sociedad in 2019. Following another loan, he signed for Arsenal in 2021 in a transfer worth an initial \u00a330 million (\u20ac35 million). After a successful first full season with Arsenal, he was announced as the club's captain in 2022.\n\u00d8degaard made his senior international debut for Norway in 2014, at age 15, and has set the record for the youngest senior Norway player, and the youngest player to play in a UEFA European Championship qualifying match. He assumed the full captaincy of Norway in March 2021.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMartin \u00d8degaard was born on 17 December 1998, in Drammen. He spent his first years in the local sports club Drammen Strong. His father, Hans Erik \u00d8degaard, a former footballer, co-founded a football section in the club, and became the coach of his son's team. In 2005, when \u00d8degaard was six, his parents and others each invested 50,000 kroner so that the local club could refit their gravel field, Kjappen, with artificial turf. This has been cited as crucial for his development, as \u00d8degaard spent countless hours on the field.\nDrammen Strong was twice selected by \u00d8degaard to receive a prize of 50,000 kroner (\u20ac5,800), when the young player was given the Statoil talent award for April 2014 and for the 2014 season. Later, in 2015, Drammen Strong received 250,000 kroner, equivalent to approximately \u20ac29,000, as a gift from Str\u00f8msgodset Toppfotball when \u00d8degaard was sold to Real Madrid.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nIn 2009, \u00d8degaard joined the youth division of Str\u00f8msgodset. He trained and played with older boys. The Norwegian Football Federation also organises young talents in local district teams, and \u00d8degaard played his first matches for the Buskerud team in January 2010, when he had just turned 11. The other players on the team, and opponents, were two to three years older. The coach noted: \"Handles things brilliantly. Good choices. Good touch, smart in position game\". \u00d8degaard trained with this team weekly for the next three years. He mostly played left back, as the coaches felt this would give him a positive experience with many ball touches while still playing against physically much stronger players. In attack, he was given free rein due to his ability to \"see solutions and spaces that we as coaches were not even close to thinking about.\"\n\nIn 2011, at age 12, he impressed former football manager Lars Tj\u00e6rn\u00e5s during a nationwide tournament for under-16s: The best 15-year-olds in the country were gathered for a tournament between the top clubs... It was definitely not the first time he had astonished his opponents or the spectators. He was three or four years younger than the others. It was impossible not to realize that we were witnessing something out of the ordinary.\n\n\n=== Str\u00f8msgodset ===\n\u00d8degaard began training with the Str\u00f8msgodset first team in 2012, aged 13. He made his first-team debut the same year, in a mid-season friendly against local rivals Mj\u00f8ndalen IF. He also had short training visits to Bayern Munich and Manchester United. In 2013, at age 14, \u00d8degaard played for both Str\u00f8msgodset's junior team (normally aged 17\u201319), and the club's third team at the fifth tier of Norwegian senior foot\nIn the sport of association football, a midfielder takes an outfield position primarily in the middle of the pitch. Midfielders may play an exclusively defensive role, breaking up attacks, and are in that case known as defensive midfielders. As central midfielders often go across boundaries, with mobility and passing ability, they are often referred to as deep-lying midfielders, play-makers, box-to-box midfielders, or holding midfielders. There are also attacking midfielders with limited defensive assignments.\nThe size of midfield units on a team and their assigned roles depend on which formation is used; the unit of these players on the pitch is commonly referred to as the midfield. Its name derives from the fact that midfield units typically make up the in-between units to the defensive units and forward units of a formation.\nManagers frequently assign one or more midfielders to disrupt the opposing team's attacks, while others may be tasked with creating goals, or have equal responsibilities between attack and defence. Midfielders are the players who typically travel the greatest distance during a match. Midfielders arguably have the most possession during a game, and thus they are some of the fittest players on the pitch. Midfielders are often assigned the task of assisting forwards to create scoring opportunities.\n\n\n== Central midfielder ==\n\nCentral or centre midfielders are players whose role is divided mostly equally between attacking and defensive duties to control the play in and around the centre of the pitch. These players will try to pass the ball to the team's attacking midfielders and forwards and may also help their team's attacks by making runs into the opposition's penalty area and attempting shots on goal themselves. They also provide secondary support to attackers, both in and out of possession.\nWhen the opposing team has the ball, a central midfielder may drop back to protect the goal or move forward and press the opposition ball-carrier to recover the ball. A centre midfielder defending their goal will move in front of their centre-backs to block long shots by the opposition and possibly track opposition midfielders making runs towards the goal.\nThe 4\u20133\u20133 and 4\u20135\u20131 formations each use three central midfielders. The 4\u22124\u22122 formation may use two central midfielders, and in the 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 formation one of the two deeper midfielders may be a central midfielder. Prominent central midfielders are known for their ability to pace the game when their team is in possession of the ball, by dictating the tempo of play from the centre of the pitch.\n\n\n=== Box-to-box midfielder ===\n\nThe term box-to-box midfielder refers to central midfielders who are hard-working and who have good all-round abilities, which makes them skilled at both defending and attacking. These players can therefore track back to their own box to make tackles and block shots and also carry the ball forward or run to the opponents' box to try to score. Beginning in the mid-2000s, the change of trends and the decline of the standard 4\u20134\u20132 formation (in many cases making way for the 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 and 4\u20133\u20133 formations) imposed restrictions on the typical box-to-box midfielders of the 1980s and 1990s, as teams' two midfield roles were now often divided into \"holders\" or \"creators\", with a third variation upon the role being described as that of a \"carrier\" or \"surger\". Some notable examples of box-to-box midfielders are Lothar Matth\u00e4us, Clarence Seedorf, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Steven Gerrard, Johan Neeskens, S\u00f3crates, Yaya Tour\u00e9, Arturo Vidal, Patrick Vieira, Frank Lampard, Bryan Robson, Roy Keane, and more recently, Jude Bellingham.\n\n\n=== Mezzala ===\nIn Italian football, the term mezzala (literally \"half-winger\" in Italian) is used to describe the position of the one or two central midfielders who play on either side of a holding midfielder and/or playmaker. The term was initially applied to the role of an inside forward in the WM and Metodo formations in Italian,\nTurks in Germany, also referred to as German Turks and Turkish Germans (German: T\u00fcrken in Deutschland/Deutscht\u00fcrken; Turkish: Almanya'daki T\u00fcrkler), are ethnic Turkish people living in Germany. These terms are also used to refer to German-born individuals who are of full or partial Turkish ancestry. \nHowever, not all people in Germany who trace their heritage back to Turkey are ethnic Turks. A significant proportion of the population is also of Kurdish, Azerbaijani descent and to a lesser extent, of Christian descent, such as Assyrian, Aramean and Armenian. Also some ethnic Turkish communities in Germany trace their ancestry to other parts of southeastern Europe or the Levant (such as Balkan Turks and Turkish Cypriots). At present, ethnic Turkish people form the largest ethnic minority in Germany. They also form the largest Turkish population in the Turkish diaspora.\nMost people of Turkish descent in Germany trace their ancestry to the Gastarbeiter (guest worker) programs in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1961, in the midst of an economic boom that resulted in a significant labor shortage, Germany signed a bilateral agreement with Turkey to allow German companies to recruit Turkish workers. The agreement was in place for 12 years, during which around 650,000 workers came from Turkey to Germany. Many also brought their spouses and children with them.\nTurks who immigrated to Germany brought cultural elements with them, including the Turkish language.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Turkish migration from the Seljuk Empire and the Rum Seljuk Sultanate ===\nDuring a series of invading Crusades by European-Christian armies into lands ruled by Turkic rulers in the Middle East, namely under the Seljuk Turks in the Seljuk Empire and the Rum Seljuk Sultanate (but also the Bahri Mamluk Sultanate), many crusaders brought back Turkish male and female prisoners of war to Europe; women were generally baptised and then married whilst \"every returning baron and count had [male] prisoners of war in his entourage.\" Some of the Beutet\u00fcrken ('booty Turks') taken to Germany during the Crusades also included children and young adults.\nThe earliest documented Turk in Germany is believed to be Sadok Seli Soltan (Mehmet Sad\u0131k Selim Sultan) (ca.1270-1328) from the Anatolian Seljuk lands. According to Streiders Hessisches Gelehrtenlexikon, Soltan was a Turkish officer who was captured by Count von Lechtomir (Reinhart von W\u00fcrttemberg) during his return to Germany from the Holy Land in 1291. By 1304 Soltan married Rebekka Dohlerin; he was baptised the following year as \"Johann Soldan\", but \"out of special love to him\", the Count \"gave him a Turkish nobility coat of arms\". Soldan and his wife had at least three sons, including Eberhardus, Christanianus and Melchior. Another source specifies that Soltan came with Count Reinhart von W\u00fcrttemberg to the residential town of Brackenheim in 1304 and was then baptised in 1305 at S. Johannis Church as \"Johannes Soldan\". There is also evidence that Soltan had a total of 12 sons born in 20 years with Anna Delcherin and Rebecca Bergm\u00e4nnin; eight of his sons passed to the clergy and do not appear in genealogy records due to compulsory celibacy associated with the clergy.\nSoltan/Soldan's descendants, who were more widespread in south-west Germany, include notable German artists, scholars, doctors, lawyers and politicians. For example, through his maternal grandmother, the renowned German poet and writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe belonged to the descendants of the Soldan family and thus had Turkish ancestry. Bernt Engelmann has said that \"the German poet prince [i.e. Goethe] with oriental ancestors is by no means a rare exception.\" Indeed, other descendants of the first recorded Turk in Germany include the lawyer Hans Soldan; the city architects and wine masters Heinrich Soldan and his son Johann Soldan who both served as Mayor of Frankenberg; the sculptor and artist Philipp Soldan; and the pharmacist Carl Soldan who founded the confecti\nThe Arsenal Football Club, commonly known as simply Arsenal, is a professional football club based in Holloway, North London, England. They compete in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. In domestic football, Arsenal have won 13 league titles (including one unbeaten title), a record 14 FA Cups, two League Cups, 17 FA Community Shields, and a Football League Centenary Trophy. In European football, they have one European Cup Winners' Cup and one Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. In terms of trophies won, it is the third-most successful club in English football.\nArsenal were the first club from southern England to join the Football League in 1893, and it reached the First Division in 1904. Relegated only once, in 1913, it continues the longest streak in the top division, and has won the second-most top-flight matches in English football history. In the 1930s, Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups, and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war. In 1970\u201371, it won its first League and FA Cup double.
