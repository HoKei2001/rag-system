{"page_content": "Arlington is a city in Tarrant County, Texas, United States. It is part of the Mid-Cities region of the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth\u2013Arlington metropolitan statistical area, and is a principal city of the metropolis and region. The city had a population of 394,266 in 2020, making it the second-largest city in the county after Fort Worth and the third-largest city in the metropolitan area, after Dallas and Fort Worth. Arlington is the 50th-most populous city in the United States, the seventh-most populous city in the state of Texas, and the largest city in the state that is not a county seat.\nArlington is home to the University of Texas at Arlington, a major urban research university, the Arlington Assembly plant used by General Motors, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Region IV, Texas Health Resources, Mensa International, and D. R. Horton. Additionally, Arlington hosts the Texas Rangers at Globe Life Field, the Dallas Cowboys at AT&T Stadium, the Arlington Renegades at Choctaw Stadium, the Dallas Wings at College Park Center, the International Bowling Campus (which houses the United States Bowling Congress, International Bowling Museum and the International Bowling Hall of Fame), and the theme parks Six Flags Over Texas (the original Six Flags) and Hurricane Harbor.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nEuropean settlement in the Arlington area dates back at least to the 1840s. After the May 24, 1841 battle between Texas General Edward H. Tarrant and Native Americans of the Village Creek settlement, a trading post was established at Marrow Bone Spring in present-day Arlington (historical marker at 32\u00b042.136\u2032N 97\u00b06.772\u2032W). The rich soil of the area attracted farmers, and several agriculture-related businesses were well established by the late nineteenth century.\nArlington was founded in 1876 along the Texas and Pacific Railway. Named after General Robert E. Lee's Arlington House in Arlington County, Virginia., Arlington grew as a cotton-ginning and farming center, and incorporated on April 21, 1884. The city could boast of water, electricity, natural gas, and telephone services by 1910, along with a public school system.\n\nFrom 1892 until 1951, a mineral well drilled exactly in the middle of downtown Arlington, Texas, was a key reason to visit the town. The water was part of the city's brand, also serving as a meeting point for everything from prohibition to the right of women to vote. The well has been paved over.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, life in Arlington was bustling with controversy and entertainment. In the early 1920s, a tea room known as \"Top O' Hill Terrace\" opened up along the now-defunct Bankhead Highway to serve dinner and tea to guests traveling through Dallas and Fort Worth. Ownership changed in the late 1920s and shortly thereafter the facilities were secretly converted into casinos and a speakeasy. Known by historians as \"Vegas before Vegas\", escape tunnels and secret rooms were constructed to hide the illegal gambling during police raids. However, the restaurant portion of the facility still existed as a legitimate business and a front.\n\nBy 1925 the city's population was estimated at 3,031\u2014well under the population of Dallas and Fort Worth at the time. In 1929, a horse-racing track called Arlington Downs was constructed by W.T. Waggoner and Brian Nyantika close by to the speakeasy. Gambling was still illegal, but people were making bets regardless. Waggoner and his sons campaigned to make parimutuel betting legal, and in 1933 the state issued its first legal gambling permit to Arlington Downs. The track was immensely profitable at that point, making a daily average of $113,000 before inflation with a daily attendance average of 6,700 people. At the end of the 1937 season, the state legislature repealed their parimutuel gambling laws, and the Downs were sold to commercial developers.\nIn the 1940s, the Arlington Downs was used as a rodeo and event venue. Top O' Hill Terrace evaded the police until 1947, when famous Texas Ranger M. T. \"Lone Wolf\"\nThe University of Texas at Arlington (UTA or UT Arlington) is a public research university in Arlington, Texas. The university was founded in 1895 and was in the Texas A&M University System for several decades until joining the University of Texas System in 1965.\nThe university is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\". The fall 2022 campus enrollment consisted of 40,990 students making it the second largest university in North Texas and fifth-largest in Texas. UT Arlington is the third-largest producer of college graduates in Texas and offers over 180 baccalaureate, masters, and doctoral degree programs.\nUT Arlington participates in 15 intercollegiate sports as a Division I member of the NCAA and Western Athletic Conference. UTA sports teams have been known as the Mavericks since 1971.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Establishment (1895\u20131916) ===\n\nThe university traces its roots back to the opening of Arlington College in September 1895. Arlington College was established as a private school for primary through secondary level students, equivalent to the modern 1st to 10th grades. At the time, the public school system in the city of Arlington was underfunded and understaffed. Local merchant Edward Emmett Rankin organized fellow citizens of the city to donate materials and land to build a schoolhouse where the modern campus is now located.\nRankin also convinced the two co-principals of the public school in Arlington, Lee Morgan Hammond and William Marshall Trimble, to invest in and hold the same positions at Arlington College. In the first few years, between 75 and 150 students were enrolled in the college. The public school began to rent space at Arlington College, and was eventually sold to the city in 1900. The public school building became so unsafe that all of the space in Arlington College was rented for the 1901\u20131902 school year until the creation of the Arlington Independent School District in 1902. Although the public education system was set to improve, Arlington College was closed and the property was sold to James McCoy Carlisle.\n\nCarlisle was already established as a respected educator in the North Texas region, and he opened the Carlisle Military Academy in the fall of 1902. His program consisted of a balance between course work and military training. Enrollment increased to 150 students by 1905, and he began a large expansion of the campus. Baseball, football, basketball, and track teams were begun between 1904 and 1908. Around the same time, new barracks, a track, a gymnasium, and an indoor pool were built. The academy became known as one of the best at its level in the country. Unfortunately, enrollment did not continue to increase with the expansion in facilities and Carlisle ran into serious financial problems.\n\nLawsuits for the mortgages on the property were filed in 1911, and Carlisle Military Academy was closed in 1913. In the fall of 1913, Henry Kirby Taylor moved from Missouri, where he was president of the Northwest State Teachers' College, to set up another military academy called Arlington Training School. He also was required to manage the finances and campus for the property owners. By the 1914\u20131915 school year, the campus contained 11 buildings on 10 acres (40,000 m2) of land with 95 students enrolled. The school was incorporated in 1915 in order to raise funds to make improvements to the existing buildings, but more financial problems arose and another series of lawsuits were filed. Taylor left Arlington, and the property owners hired John B. Dodson to establish a third military academy for the 1916\u20131917 school year called Arlington Military Academy. Enrollment was apparently very low, and Arlington Military Academy closed after one year.\n\n\n=== Texas A&M University System (1917\u20131965) ===\n\nSince the turn of the 20th century, the prospects for turning the campus into a public, junior vocational college had been discussed. By 1917, the Agricultural and Mechanical College of \nThis is a list of Texas\u2013Arlington Mavericks football players in the NFL Draft.\n\n\n== Key ==\n\n\n== Selections ==\nSource:\n\n\n== References ==\nArlington Stadium was a baseball stadium located in Arlington, Texas, United States, located between Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas. It served as the home for the Texas Rangers (MLB) from 1972 until 1993, after which the team moved into The Ballpark in Arlington (now Choctaw Stadium).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years as a minor league stadium ===\nThe stadium was built in 1965 as Turnpike Stadium, a minor league ballpark seating 10,000 people named for the nearby Dallas\u2013Fort Worth Turnpike (now part of Interstate 30, and known as the Tom Landry Highway). The Fort Worth Cats of the Texas League moved there as the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth Spurs, and played there for the next seven years, setting many Texas League attendance records during their tenure at the stadium, especially after it expanded to 20,500 seats in 1970.\nHowever, the stadium's real purpose was to attract a major league team to the Metroplex. It had been built to be upgraded to Major League standards of the era, and was designed to be expandable to up to 50,000 seats (although its final actual capacity was 7,000 seats below that). Due to its location in a natural bowl, only minimal excavations (such as connecting dugouts directly to the clubhouses) would be necessary for it to be ready for a big-league team. Although it was built primarily with baseball in mind, its general shape was very similar to the major league multi-purpose stadiums that were beginning to emerge in the mid-1960s. In fact, the stadium was designed to accommodate football, but the Dallas Cowboys were never interested in playing in the stadium. The Metroplex had been mentioned as a possible expansion site since the 1950s, and Arlington Mayor Tom Vandergriff figured that Arlington, halfway between the two cities, would be the best site for a prospective major league team.\n\n\n=== 1970s\u20131980s ===\n\nIn 1971, the struggling second incarnation of the Washington Senators announced their intentions to move to the Metroplex under the banner of the Texas Rangers. The stadium was expanded to seat over 35,700 people, and was renamed Arlington Stadium. The stadium played host to its first major league game on April 21, 1972, when the Rangers inaugurated the stadium by defeating the California Angels, 7\u20136; MLB's first-ever strike had disrupted the start of the 1972 season, hence the later than anticipated opening day.\nArlington Stadium had no roof, and thus virtually no protection from the oppressive Texas heat. For nearly all of its existence, it was the hottest stadium in the majors. It was not unusual for game-time temperatures to be well above 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C). Combined with the Rangers' mediocre performance, this held down attendance considerably during the 1970s. Due in part to the heat, the Rangers scheduled nearly all of their games from May through September at night to get around it. Other than nearby amusement park Six Flags Over Texas, there was no neighborhood around the park. In his book Storied Stadiums, Curt Smith described it as \"small, (but) not intimate\".\nThe scoreboard in the Rangers' early days was a long, horizontal rectangle with a panel shaped like the state of Texas. It was replaced after the 1984 season with a new scoreboard and series of billboards that ran from both foul poles. \"Cotton-Eyed Joe\" was played during the seventh-inning stretch for fans to dance to instead of \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\". Arlington Stadium was also the first major league ballpark to sell nachos (in 1974).\n\n\n=== 1990s ===\n\nThe stadium eventually began to show its age and inadequacy, and the City of Arlington approved the construction of a new stadium for the Rangers. The last game was played in Arlington Stadium on October 3, 1993, resulting in a 4\u20131 win by the visiting Kansas City Royals, witnessed by 41,039 fans (it was also the final game in the career of Hall-of-Famer George Brett, who recorded the last hit in the stadium with a ninth-inning single). Following the 1993 season, the Rangers moved to The Ballpark \nThe UT Arlington Mavericks (abbreviated UT Arlington, UTA, and Mavs) are the athletic teams that represent the University of Texas at Arlington in Arlington, Texas. The Mavericks currently compete in the NCAA Division I Western Athletic Conference in 15 varsity sports. The number rose to 15 in the fall of 2017 women's golf began their first season of competition that athletic season.\nJon Fagg is the current athletic director. Prior to his stint at UTA, he was a Deputy Athletics Director, overseeing daily administration and NCAA compliance for the Arkansas Razorbacks at the University of Arkansas. Fagg replaced Jim Baker, who led the Athletic Department from 2012 to 2022.\n\n\n== General history ==\n\nUTA was a founding member of the Southland Conference in 1963 and participated in the league until the end of the 2011\u201312 athletic year. They joined the Western Athletic Conference for one year before they moved to the Sun Belt Conference. They left the Sun Belt and rejoined the WAC on July 1, 2022.\nUT Arlington won the Southland Conference's Commissioners Cup three times since the award was first instituted in 1998. The Commissioner's Cup is awarded to the athletics program with the highest all-around performance in all conference events, including all men's and women's events. The Athletic Department finished within two points of the Bubas Cup, the Sun Belt's all-sports championship trophy, twice in 2014-15 and 2016\u201317, as well as a second-place finish in 2018\u201319.\nWhen the school transitioned from junior college to University status in 1959, the schools athletic teams were known as the Rebels. Controversy would surround the name after a decades time. A series of events would occur that lead to a change in mascots to the current version. The Mavericks' name selection was made in 1971, predating the National Basketball Association's expansion franchise Dallas Mavericks' starting choice in 1980.\nThe first women's programs began competition in the 1973\u201374 school year. Volleyball, basketball and softball were the first three programs, competing in the AIAW until the teams moved under the umbrella of the NCAA in 1982\u201383.\n\n\n== Sports sponsored ==\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\n\n\n==== Men's basketball ====\n\nHome games are played at College Park Center, located on University of Texas at Arlington's campus in Arlington. The team appeared in the 2008 NCAA tournament, losing against the No. 1 seed Memphis in the first round. Later, Memphis had to forfeit their win for \"ineligible competition, impermissible benefits and failure to monitor its athletics programs.\"\nOn November 29, 2016, the Mavericks defeated the Texas Longhorns in Austin for the first time in program history after 11 attempts. The Longhorns decided to terminate their contract with them after their 2016 loss due to the Mavericks becoming too competitive. The terminated contract paid the Mavericks a large lump sum for each game played in Austin for six consecutive years (2011-2016).\nAlthough only 22 of 65 University seasons have resulted in an overall winning record, 13 of the past 22 seasons have finished with a .500 winning percentage or greater, including a school record 27 wins in the 2016\u201317 season (as of the conclusion of the 2022\u201323 season). They won the Southland Conference regular season championship in 2012, along with a tie for the 2004 regular season championship and a 2008 conference tournament championship that led to their first NCAA Tournament appearance. The first Sun Belt regular season title was earned in the record-setting year of 2016\u20132017.\nOverall, the team has played in six postseason tournaments and won four conference championships.\n\n\n==== Women's basketball ====\n\nThe women's basketball team was established in 1973 and experienced early success with a combined 64\u201332 record in three seasons between 1975 and 1977. The Mavericks participated in several AIAW state and regional tournaments before joining the Southland Conference beginning with the 1982\u201383 season.\nBetween 2\nElections are currently every two years to elect the mayor of Arlington, Texas.\nElections are officially non-partisan, and use a two-round system, where election runoffs are held if no candidate obtains the majority of the vote.\n\n\n== Elections before 1997 ==\n\n\n== 1997 ==\n\nThe 1997 Arlington mayoral election was held on May 3, 1997.

It replaced the nearby Arlington Stadium, and was succeeded by Globe Life Field. \nIn 2020, the stadium was retrofitted for football and soccer. It is the current home of the North Texas SC of MLS Next Pro (FC Dallas's reserve team), and the Arlington Renegades of the UFL.\nOn August 25, 2021, Choctaw Casinos & Resorts bought the naming rights to the stadium.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn April 1989, Rangers owner Eddie Chiles sold the team to an investment group headed by George W. Bush. The aging Arlington Stadium was outdated and did not have amenities that helped make other baseball franchises more profitable. As a result, the team could not compete with other big-city teams for good players. In an effort to fund the project through public money instead of private financing, the Rangers threatened to leave Arlington. The city of Arlington spent $150,000 on an advertising campaign to persuade voters to approve the funding through a referendum by printing brochures, placing telemarketing calls, and planning a \"Hands Around Arlington Day.\" On January 19, 1991, over 65% of voters approved the deal, allowing the city government to cover 71% of the costs ($135 million out of $191 million) of building the new ballpark. The deal called for the city to raise the sales tax by half a cent to go toward construction. Both houses of the Texas Legislature unanimously approved the public purpose of the ballpark, and Texas Governor Ann Richards signed it all into law.\nAs part of the deal, the city created a separate corporation, the Arlington Sports Facilities Development Authority (ASFDA), to manage construction. Using authority granted to it by the city, the ASFDA seized several tracts of land around the stadium site using eminent domain for parking and future development.\nConstruction on the stadium, which was dubbed The Ballpark in Arlington, began on April 2, 1992, a short distance away from Arlington Stadium, the stadium it would replace, and the new Ballpark in Arlington opened on April 1, 1994, in an exhibition contest between the Rangers and the New York Mets. The first official game was on April 11 against the Milwaukee Brewers.\nAmeriquest bought the naming rights to the ballpark on May 7, 2004, and renamed it Ameriquest Field in Arlington. The Rangers severed their relationship with Ameriquest on March 19, 2007, and announced the park would be renamed Rangers Ballpark in Arlington.\nThe largest crowd to watch a Rangers baseball game was on October 30, 2010, when 52,419 fans watched Game 3 of the 2010 World Series against the San Francisco Giants.\nGlobe Life and Accident Insurance Company, a subsidiary of McKinney-based Globe Life, bought the naming rights for the facility on February 5, 2014, naming it Globe Life Park in Arlington.\nOn May 20, 2016, the Rangers announced that they intended to move from Globe Life Park to the new Globe Life Field, beginning with the 2020 season. The new air conditioned stadium was slated to feature a retractable roof, which many argued could increase stadium revenue from those who would otherwise not want to sit in the heat during games as the season progresses throughout the hot Texas summer, in particular those that occur in the afternoon. Voting for the new ballpark began on November 8 (the same day as the 2016 presidential election) for residents in the city limits of Arlington. The ballpark was passed with a 60% favorable vote. The stadium opened in the 2020 season.\n\nThe new stadium was built south of Globe Life Park, on the site of a surface parking lot between Randol Mill Road and Cowboys Way. Space between the new stadium and Globe Life Park was constructed into an entertainment complex called Texas Live!, d\nArlington High School (AHS), located in Arlington, Texas, United States, is a secondary school serving grades 9-12.

Sam Houston High School opens in fall 1963.\nSam Houston, AISD's second high school, opened in the eastern part of Arlington in the Fall of 1963. The original boundary between Houston and Arlington High School was described by Cathy Brown of The Dallas Morning News as \"a north/south zig zag.\" The boundary extended from a point near the intersection of Cooper at Mansfield northward to Arkansas Lane. From there, it extended east to Johnson Creek and then ran alongside the creek to Collins.

Consisting of former Deep Purple singer Rod Evans, former Johnny Winter drummer Bobby Caldwell, former Iron Butterfly guitarist Larry Reinhardt and former Iron Butterfly bassist Lee Dorman, the band had an eclectic style bridging elements of hard rock, progressive rock and jazz fusion with space rock. They released three albums between 1972 and 1977. \nThe band was plagued from its inception with significant problems, including lawsuits involving Evans, Reinhardt and Dorman with their former bands, and a dispute over musical style with their record label, Capricorn Records. Although the band performed well together, relationships among the various band members were strained. In particular, singer Rod Evans left and rejoined the band several times beginning in 1971, and made his departure permanent in late 1973, after the release of the band's second album.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe original line-up for Captain Beyond included former Deep Purple singer Rod Evans, former Johnny Winter drummer Bobby Caldwell, former Iron Butterfly guitarist Larry \"Rhino\" Reinhardt and former Iron Butterfly bassist Lee Dorman alongside keyboardist Lewie Gold. Gold left for personal reasons before the first album was recorded. The remaining line-up recorded the self-titled debut album, released in 1972 by Capricorn Records, a Macon, Georgia-based independent label primarily known for cultivating such Southern rock groups as The Allman Brothers Band and Wet Willie.\nFollowing that album, Caldwell left the band to join Derringer and was replaced by Brian Glascock. Also joining the band around that time were keyboardist Reese Wynans and conguero Guille Garcia. The record company's chosen producer, Giorgio Gomelsky, did not like Glascock's drumming and requested a new drummer. Glascock was released and Marty Rodriguez was brought in on drums on the recommendation of Garcia. This six-man lineup recorded the group's second album, Sufficiently Breathless, with producer and Capricorn Records co-founder Phil Walden. Tension during the recording led to Evans quitting, and the band splitting consequently. The original lineup with Caldwell reformed later in 1973 for gigs in the US and Canada. However, Evans left the band permanently around Christmas of 1973 and the band broke up.\nThe band reformed in 1976 with Caldwell, Dorman, and Rhino, being joined first by Jason Cahoon and later with Willy Daffern as vocalist. They recorded the band's third album Dawn Explosion on Warner Bros., but broke up in 1978.\nCaldwell and Rhino reformed Captain Beyond in 1998, with Jimi Interval on vocals, Dan Frye on keyboards, and Jeff Artabasy on bass. In 1999, Swedish record label Record Heaven released a tribute to Captain Beyond entitled Thousand Days of Yesterday. The album features fellow 1970s rockers Pentagram playing \"Dancing Madly Backwards\". In 2000 they released a four track EP entitled Night Train Calling. Shortly thereafter they were joined briefly by guitarist Steve Petrey.\nCaptain Beyond once again disbanded in 2003 when lead guitarist Larry Reinhardt developed cancer. Following treatment, Reinhardt continued to perform music until late 2011, when he again fell ill. He died on January 2, 2012. Bassist Lee Dorman died on December 21, 2012. Rod Evans has retired from performing, partly due to legal troubles with his original Deep Purple bandmates, and his current residence is still unknown. However, Caldwell mentioned in a 2015 interview that Evans was doing just fine and was working in the field of respiratory therapy.\nCaldwell resurrected the band in 2013, with a lineup consisting of Don Bonzi, Jeff \"Boday\" Christensen, and Jamie Holka, bassist Allen Carmen, and guitarist/keyboardist/vocalist Simon Lind. In 2015 Carmen and Christensen departed the band and Artabasy returned as bassist.

Martin High School is a secondary school for grades 9 to 12 in Arlington, Texas, United States. It is part of the Arlington Independent School District. The school's colors are red, black and silver.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe school opened in 1982. As a result, the former James Bowie High School closed in 1983. The relative proximity of Bowie to Sam Houston High School was a factor as was the shifting demographics and resulting graduation class sizes that necessitated the new school and the transition of Bowie to Workman Junior High School. Cathy Brown of The Dallas Morning News wrote that Sam Houston High School and Lamar High School were \"relatively unaffected\" by the opening of Martin, located in southwest Arlington. She explained that the attendance zone of Arlington High School lost substantial area that included a significant number of new residences in the more affluent Southwest part of the city adjacent to Lake Arlington.\nMartin High School is one of only two high schools in the district not named for a historical figure in Texas. The trustees broke with the Arlington tradition of naming high schools in this manner when naming the school in its planning in the earlier 1980s. Only Martin High School and Arlington High School, the town's first high school, are exceptions. AISD trustees chose to honor James W. Martin, superintendent of schools from 1955 to 1976, who oversaw the integration (racial desegregation) of Arlington schools in 1965, which occurred without the violence or hysterics that had occurred frequently nationwide, and notably in nearby Mansfield. This was not shared at the time of the school's opening, however.\nThe school opened with grades 10 to 12 and grew to become the city's largest high school within a decade. Construction in 1996-1997 expanded the size of the campus considerably to make room for the addition of freshmen in the 1997\u20131998 school year.\nIn 2015, the AISD STEM Academy began classes at Martin. The Academy provides advanced classes in engineering, biology/biomedical science, computer science, and math/science to students in 9th-12th grade. STEM students can also take classes at the University of Texas at Arlington while they are enrolled in high school. The program is free, but spots are limited.  \nIn July 2020, Principal Marlene Roddy announced the discontinuation of the native American mascot at the school, saying the reason was \"...to adapt the school to modern standards of cultural sensitivity\", which has been a contentious topic in many communities and in professional sports, notably the NFL's Washington (former) Redskins and the Cleveland Indians major league baseball team. The change was met with opposition, primarily from alumni, but it was implemented. The Warrior would remain in writing, but the modern definition of the term is being embraced and will no longer refer to the Native American iconography, specifically the war bonnet and mascot. The school's \"rocking M\" became its primary graphic. The \"Native American tribal chieftain hat\" logo had been in use at the school since its opening in 1982, having been illustrated by one of its students. The war bonnet was formed by shaping the letters comprising \"Warriors\" and the face was in the same manner using the letters MHS, both in red, forming a Native American chief in profile. Similar changes occurred later at nearby South Grand Prairie High School, which coincidentally are known at the Warriors.\n\n\n== Feeder patterns ==\nCorey, Moore and Wood Elementary Schools feed into Boles Jr. High.

It is the first amusement park in the Six Flags chain, and features themed areas and attractions. The park opened on August 5, 1961, after a year of construction and an initial investment of US$10 million by real estate developer Angus G. Wynne Jr.\nThe park is managed by the Six Flags Entertainment Corp., which owns a 54% interest of the Texas Limited Partnership that owns the park. Six Flags Over Texas Fund, Ltd., a private-equity and asset-management firm, headed by Dallas businessman Jack Knox, bought the park in 1969. Over the years, the various companies that managed the park exercised options to purchase interest in the fund. Six Flags Entertainment has an option to purchase the remaining 46% in 2028. In 1991, Time Warner Entertainment began managing park operations. In 1998, Time Warner sold its interests in the Six Flags parks to Premier Parks, of Oklahoma City, which later changed its name to Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAfter a visit to Disneyland in Anaheim, California, shortly after its opening, a wealthy real estate developer, Angus G. Wynne Jr., concluded that his home state, Texas, should have a similar park. Planning for such a place began in 1959, under the leadership of Wynne and the Great Southwest Corporation, along with the backing of various New York City investors. Construction of the park began in August 1960.\nThe name \"Six Flags Over Texas\" refers to the flags of the six nations that have governed Texas: Spain, France, Mexico, the Republic of Texas, the United States of America, and the Confederate States of America. Wynne originally intended to name the park \"Texas Under Six Flags\". Various legends have attributed the name change to his wife, Joann; to the Daughters of the Republic of Texas, of which his wife may have been a member; and to his entertainment director, Charles Meeker, who is said to have stated \"Texas isn't 'under' anything.\" The original park was divided into six themed areas for each of the six entities that had ruled Texas. Other themed areas have since been added.\nSix Flags Over Texas opened its gates from July 29 to August 4, 1961, to several local corporations that Wynne had invited as part of a \"soft-test opening\". The park held its grand-opening ceremonies on Saturday, August 5, 1961. Dignitaries included the mayors of Arlington, Dallas, Fort Worth, Grand Prairie, and Irving. Park attendance reached 8,374. Admission cost $2.75 (equivalent to $28 in 2023) for adults and $2.25 (equivalent to $23 in 2023) for children; parking cost 50 cents (equivalent to $5 in 2023); hamburgers, 35 cents (equivalent to $4 in 2023); soft drinks, 10 cents (equivalent to $1 in 2023). On opening day, guests could visit the six original themed sections: Mexico, Spain, France, The Confederacy, Texas, and Modern (representing the United States). According to the 1961 Park Map there were 46 \"major attractions\". The park's first season, lasting 45 days and ending on November 25, 1961, was a success, with over 550,000 visitors.\nDuring its first decade, the park added two sections: Boomtown, named after the boomtowns that sprang up quickly during Texas' oil boom era and the \"Tower Section\", named after the Oil Derrick observation tower built in 1969. The park also added two attractions: El Aserradero in 1963 and the Runaway Mine Train roller coaster in 1966. Attendance reached close to 2 million visitors a year by the end of the decade. \nIn 1974, Six Flags Over Texas announced attendance had reached 2,184,000.\nFor the 50th anniversary (2011), Six Flags Over Texas introduced the first I-Box roller coaster track with a transformation of Texas Giant. The reception from the conversion led the manufacturer to bring the new technology all over the world. \nDuring this time, Six Flags (the company) began to remove licensed theming from its theme parks, including from attractions that\nThe Arkansas\u2013Texas A&M football rivalry is an American college football rivalry between the Arkansas Razorbacks and Texas A&M Aggies, which started in 1903. Between 1992 and 2008, the schools did not play each other when Arkansas left the Southwest Conference to join the Southeastern Conference. The rivalry was renewed as a neutral-site out-of-conference contest (and branded as The Southwest Classic) in 2009; in 2012 it once again became a conference rivalry when Texas A&M also joined the Southeastern Conference. Arkansas leads the series 42\u201336\u20133.\n\n\n== Series history ==\nArkansas and Texas A&M first played each other in 1903, and would play each other three times from 1903 to 1912, all as non-conference matchups.\nArkansas and Texas A&M would not meet on the field again until 1927, notwithstanding that both schools became charter members of the Southwest Conference twelve years earlier in 1915. The schools played annually from 1927 to 1930, but would not meet again until 1934. From 1934 to 1991, the two teams played annually as conference members. The annual matchup ceased in 1991 when Arkansas left the conference to join the Southeastern Conference.\nOn March 10, 2008, officials from both schools announced the series would recommence on October 3, 2009, under the name \"Southwest Classic.\" The annual location for the game was announced as Cowboys Stadium (now called AT&T Stadium), located in Arlington. The attendance for the stadium was initially expected to be in the 80,000 range. Depending on ticket demand, temporary seating can be added to the stadium to increase the capacity up to 100,000 seats for the game. The tickets were said to be split 50/50 between the two schools. The initial agreement between the two schools allowed the game to be played for at least 10 years, followed by 5 consecutive, 4-year rollover options, allowing the game to potentially be played for a total of 30 consecutive seasons.\nThe rivalry once again became a conference matchup when Texas A&M joined the SEC on July 1, 2012, and became a member of the West Division of the conference alongside Arkansas. However, for Texas A&M's first two seasons in the SEC the series was played as a home-and-home series at the schools' campuses (Texas A&M hosted in 2012 and Arkansas hosted in 2013); the series resumed neutral-site play in AT&T Stadium for the 2014 season until at least 2024. Multiple athletic directors at Texas A&M have expressed a desire to move away from playing the game at AT&T Stadium, and on July 20, 2020, it was reported that the game would be played at Kyle Field due to precautions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, with a return trip potentially being played at Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium in 2021. That return trip to Fayetteville did not happen, and the series resumed being played in Arlington in 2021.\nAfter joining the SEC in 2012, A&M went on a 9-game winning streak, which was its longest in the series and first winning streak of more than 2 games in the series for the Aggies since 1938\u20131943. Arkansas broke the streak in 2021 and improved its record against A&M in Arlington to 4\u20136.\nStarting in 2025, the game will no longer be a neutral-site game played in Arlington. Further, due to the expansion of the SEC in 2024, which eliminated divisions, the two teams will no longer meet on an annual basis, as both teams are not protected opponents of each other in conference scheduling.\n\n\n== Game results ==\n\n\n=== Locations ===\n\n\n== Notable games ==\n\n\n=== 1903 \u2013 First meeting ===\nTexas A&M 6 \u2013 Arkansas 0\n\nIn the first ever meeting, and only the 43rd game ever played by Arkansas and the 42nd ever played by Texas A&M, the Aggies won 6\u20130.

On February 7, 2019, Bob Stoops, the longtime head coach of the Oklahoma Sooners football team, was hired as the Dallas team's head coach. Stoops was the XFL's first head coaching hire. On April 23, 2019, Stoops named Chris Woods as his defensive coordinator. On May 16, 2019, Stoops named Hal Mumme as his offensive coordinator. The team name and logo were revealed on August 21, 2019, as well as the teams uniforms on December 3, 2019.\nOn October 15, 2019, The Renegades announced their first player in team history, being assigned former NFL quarterback Landry Jones.\nDallas lost their first game, against the St. Louis BattleHawks, by a 15\u20139 final. Kicker Austin MacGinnis tallied all of the Renegade points via field goals, but Dallas' failure to reach the end zone came back to haunt them, as St. Louis scored nine unanswered fourth quarter points to erase a slim deficit. Linebacker Tegray Scales had 13 Dallas tackles, three for a loss. The Renegades picked up their first win on the road, a 25\u201318 triumph over the Los Angeles Wildcats. Running back Cameron Artis-Payne reached the end zone three times on two touchdowns and a one-point conversion. His final score, a 17-yard scoring run in the penultimate minute, was the final blow in a fourth quarter that saw the two teams combined for 34 points. Another road victory awaited the Renegades in Week 3, as they topped the Seattle Dragons 24\u201312. Two MacGinnis field goals sandwiched a 65-yard touchdown pass from Landry Jones to Donald Parham in a fourth quarter that saw Dallas break a 12\u201312 tie. Parham reached the end zone twice over the afternoon. The XFL announced that the remainder of the 2020 XFL season had been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The team finished with a 2\u20133 record. On April 10, 2020, the XFL suspended operations, with all employees, players and staff terminated.\n\n\n=== Arlington (2023\u2013present, Dwayne Johnson and Dany Garcia era) ===\n\nOn August 3, 2020, it was reported that a consortium led by Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, Dany Garcia, and Gerry Cardinale (through Cardinale's fund RedBird Capital Partners) purchased the XFL for $15 million just hours before an auction could take place; the purchase received court approval on August 7, 2020. The XFL hired Bob Stoops as a Head Coach on April 13, 2022, with the expectation that he would be coaching Dallas. On July 24, 2022, the return of a Dallas XFL franchise was confirmed, this time being known as \"Arlington\" instead of \"Dallas\", as well as the hiring of Bob Stoops. On October 31, 2022, the XFL officially announced that the Renegades name would be returning, with a brand new logo. The team went 4\u20136 in the 2023 season, but made the playoffs as the second team in the South Division. After beating the Houston Roughnecks in the South Division playoff game, it won the 2023 XFL Championship Game over the 10\u20131 D.C.

It has a drainage area of 143 square miles (370 km2).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe lake was constructed by the city of Arlington in 1956, and was finished on March 31, 1957. It opened for fishing the following March on March 1, 1958.\nIn 1983, the lake came under scrutiny from residents of Fort Worth due to a large amount of dumping being performed into the lake.\nIn winter of 1993\u201394, the lake was refurbished with new docks. Two new docks and a boat loading ramp were installed at Richard W. Simpson Park, which borders the lake. The docks replaced 30-year old structures. The improvements cost $500,000, $300,000 coming from a 1991 bond issue, and $200,000 coming from a Texas Parks and Wildlife grant.\n\n\n== References ==\nThe UT Arlington Mavericks football team represented the University of Texas at Arlington from the 1959 through 1985 seasons. Between 1919 through 1958, UTA competed as a junior college prior to moving to the NCAA College Division in 1959 and ultimately the University Division in 1971. UTA played its home games at multiple stadiums throughout their history with the most recent being Maverick Stadium, in Arlington, Texas.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe UT Arlington football team traces its roots to 1919 when the program was established at Grubbs Vocational College. By 1923, Grubbs was renamed as the North Texas Agricultural College with the football team then playing as the Junior Aggies competing in the Central Texas Conference. As the Aggies, the program captured four conference championships through the 1948 season. The 1943 North Texas Aggies football team was ranked at No. 69 among the nation's college and military service teams in the final 1943 Litkenhous Ratings.\nBy 1949, the school changed its name and mascot again, competing as the Arlington State Blue Riders through the 1950 season only to once more change the mascot to the Rebels for the 1951 season. Arlington would reach their zenith as a junior college program in capturing both the 1956 and 1957 Junior Rose Bowls as national junior college champions. Following the 1958 season, Arlington State became a four-year school and begin competition as a College Division school.\nAfter founding the Southland Conference as a charter member for the 1964 season, by 1966, the school officially became the University of Texas at Arlington. UTA won conference championships in 1966, 1967 and 1981 seasons in addition to winning their lone bowl game, the 1967 Pecan Bowl. The program would be officially disbanded after an announcement by then university president Wendell Nedderman on November 25, 1985, citing financial loss and low attendance as the primary impetus for its abandonment.\nDespite the team's disbandment, the UTA Maverick Marching Band was determined to stay intact. They shifted focus to performing at various contests and events around the state and remain one of the only college marching bands in the United States to stand alone without a football program.\nIn 2023, the UTA students voted on a referendum which gauged student support for the return of football resulting in increased student fees. The referendum passed 1,004 in favor to 625 opposed.\n\n\n== Seasons ==\nThis listing includes only the seasons UTA competed as a four-year college beginning with the 1959 season.\n\n\n== Stadiums ==\nMemorial Stadium, 1959\u20131969\nTurnpike Stadium, 1970\u20131976\nCravens Field, 1977\u20131979\nMaverick Stadium, 1980\u20131985\n\n\n== References ==\nTarrant County is a county located in the U.S. state of Texas with a 2020 U.S. census population of 2,110,640, making it the third-most populous county in Texas and the 15th-most populous in the United States. Its county seat is Fort Worth. Tarrant County, one of 26 counties created out of the Peters Colony, was established in 1849 and organized the next year. It is named after Edward H. Tarrant, a lawyer, politician, and militia leader.\nThe ancestral homelands of Native American tribes:  Caddo, Tonkawa, Comanche, and Cherokee covered Tarrant County. The Native American tribes resisted settlement and fought to defend their land.  The Battle of Village Creek is a well known battle that took place in Tarrant County.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has an area of 902 square miles (2,340 km2), of which 864 square miles (2,240 km2) is land and 39 square miles (100 km2) (4.3%) is water.\n\n\n=== Adjacent counties ===\nDenton County (north)\nDallas County (east)\nEllis County (southeast)\nJohnson County (south)\nParker County (west)\nWise County (northwest)\n\n\n== Communities ==\n\n\n=== Cities (multiple counties) ===\n\n\n=== Cities ===\n\n\n=== Towns ===\n\n\n=== Census-designated places ===\nBriar (partly in Wise and Parker counties)\nPecan Acres (small part in Wise County)\nRendon\n\n\n=== Historical census-designated places ===\nEagle Mountain\n\n\n=== Unincorporated communities ===\n\n\n=== Historical communities ===\nBirdville\nBisbee\nBransford\nCenter Point\nEderville\nGarden Acres\nHandley\nJohnsons Station\n\n\n=== Ghost towns ===\nBirds\nDido\nMinters Chapel\n\n\n=== Notes ===\nItalics indicate that the city is a principal city of DFW or a county seat.\nThe term \"town\" is used only in reference to relative population.

The Rangers compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) West Division. They are one of two major league clubs based in Texas, alongside the Houston Astros of the same league. The team was founded as the Washington Senators in 1961, an expansion team awarded to Washington, D.C., after its previous team became the Minnesota Twins. The new Senators relocated to Arlington, Texas after the 1971 season and debuted as the Rangers the following spring. In 2020, the Rangers moved to the new Globe Life Field after having played at Globe Life Park (now Choctaw Stadium) from 1994 to 2019. The team's name is derived from a historic law enforcement agency.\nThe Rangers have made nine appearances in the MLB postseason, seven following division championships in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2010, 2011, 2015, and 2016 and as a wild card team in both 2012 and 2023. Prior to 2010, the Rangers were the only team in MLB to have never advanced past the first round of the playoffs. In 2010, the Rangers advanced past the Division Series for the first time, defeating the Tampa Bay Rays. The team then won their first American League pennant after beating the New York Yankees in six games; league MVP Josh Hamilton won their first ALCS MVP award for a Ranger player. In their first appearance in a World Series, the Rangers fell to the San Francisco Giants in five games. They repeated as American League champions the following year, but lost the 2011 World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. The Rangers made it to the 2023 World Series and won their first-ever championship, defeating the Arizona Diamondbacks in five games, with Corey Seager being the first Ranger player to win the World Series Most Valuable Player Award.\nFrom 1961 through the end of 2024, the franchise's overall win\u2013loss record is 4,818\u20135,302\u20136 (.476). Since moving to Texas in 1972, the Rangers have an overall win\u2013loss record of 4,078\u20134,270\u20135 (.489) through the end of 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Washington Senators (1961\u20131971) ===\n\nWhen the original Washington Senators announced their move to Minnesota to become the Twins in 1961, Major League Baseball decided to expand a year earlier than planned to stave off the twin threats of competition from the proposed Continental League and loss of its exemption from the Sherman Antitrust Act. As part of the expansion, the American League added two expansion teams for the 1961 season\u2013the Los Angeles Angels and a new Washington Senators team. The new Senators and Angels began to fill their rosters with American League players in an expansion draft. The team played their inaugural season at old Griffith Stadium, then moved to the new District of Columbia Stadium in 1962 under a ten-year lease.\n\nFor most of their existence, the new Senators epitomized futility, losing an average of 90 games a season. The team's struggles led to a twist on a joke about the old Senators: \"Washington: first in war, first in peace and still last in the American League.\" Frank Howard, an outfielder/first baseman from 1965 to 1972 known for his towering home runs, was the team's most accomplished player, winning two home run titles.\nThe concurrent rise of the nearby Baltimore Orioles to regular championship contenders (winning their first World Series in 1966) certainly did not help the Senators draw crowds. Further expansion and re-alignment in 1969 did not do much to help the Senators either, since (unlike the National League) the AL owners elected to align their new divisions strictly based on geography. This arrangement placed both expansion teams (the Seattle Pilots and the Kansas City Royals) in the AL West, while pitting last place Washington against the AL's five best teams in the AL East. Despite this, the Senators managed a winning season in 1969 (their only winning record in the nation's capital) when Hall of Famer Ted Wi\nThe 1985 UT Arlington Mavericks football team was an American football team that represented the University of Texas at Arlington in the Southland Conference during the 1985 NCAA Division I-AA football season.

At the conclusion of the season on November 25, UTA President Wendell Nedderman announced the football program was to be discontinued citing financial concerns.\n\n\n== Schedule ==\n\n\n== Game summaries ==\n\n\n=== Angelo State ===\n\n\n=== At Drake ===\n\n\n=== Lamar ===\n\n\n=== At No. 15 Arkansas State ===\n\n\n=== At McNeese State ===\n\n\n=== Louisiana Tech ===\n\n\n=== At North Texas State ===\n\n\n== References ==\nArlington Assembly is a General Motors automobile factory located in Arlington, Texas. The plant has operated for more than 60 years and today manufactures large SUVs from GM's divisions Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Arlington plant was opened in 1954 to assemble both automobiles and aircraft, but has focused on the former use for most of its history. Arlington Assembly was originally part of the Buick-Oldsmobile-Pontiac Assembly Division and was used to assemble Buicks, Oldsmobiles, and Pontiacs. The Buick-Oldsmobile-Pontiac Assembly Division was renamed General Motors Assembly Division in 1965 after it also began to assemble Chevrolet cars in 1963. Early automobile production included models like the Pontiac Chieftain and later, the Chevrolet Bel Air.  The factory would continue to produce many large GM cars through the 1990s including products from Buick, Oldsmobile, Chevrolet and Cadillac.  Arlington Assembly was the last GM B-body manufacturing facility when GM decided to consolidate operations and convert the plant to SUV production.  The plant occupies 250 acres (1,000,000 square meters). Arlington Assembly has produced models for all of GM's primary American brands: Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, Cadillac, and GMC. \nThe first GM factory in the \"Dallas-Ft. Worth\" area was originally built in 1917 to build the Chevrolet Series 490 and the Chevrolet Series F on the south side of West Seventh Street and Slayton Street just west of Trinity Park. Due to a flood of the Trinity River in 1922 and flood control taxes levied by the local government, GM closed the factory in 1924 and in 1929 Leeds Assembly opened in Kansas City, Missouri. The Chevrolet Motor Company Building in Dallas replaced the Trinity Park facility from 1923 until 1935 and was replaced by the more advanced Arlington Factory in the early 1950s.\n\n\n== Vehicles produced ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nSince 2020 (2021 model year), Arlington Assembly manufactures large SUVs based on GM's GMT T1XX platform:\n\nChevrolet Tahoe\nChevrolet Suburban\nGMC Yukon/Yukon Denali\nGMC Yukon XL/Yukon XL Denali\nCadillac Escalade\nCadillac Escalade ESV\n\n\n=== Former ===\n\n\n=== Milestone vehicles ===\nThese are the milestone vehicles produced by Arlington Assembly:\n\n1 millionth vehicle: 1965 Pontiac Bonneville\n2 millionth vehicle: 1971 Oldsmobile Cutlass\n3 millionth vehicle: 1976 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme\n4 millionth vehicle: 1981 Chevrolet Monte Carlo\n5 millionth vehicle: 1985 Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS\n6 millionth vehicle: 1993 Buick Roadmaster\n7 millionth vehicle: 2002 Cadillac Escalade\n8 Millionth vehicle: 2006 Chevrolet Tahoe\n9 Millionth vehicle: 2011 Chevrolet Suburban\n10 millionth vehicle: 2015 Chevrolet Suburban\n11 millionth vehicle: 2018 Chevrolet Tahoe RST\n12 millionth vehicle: 2021 Chevrolet Suburban\n13 millionth vehicle: 2024 Cadillac Escalade-V\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nLamar High School is a secondary school in Arlington, Texas.

Lamar relieved Arlington High School and Sam Houston High School. Cathy Brown of The Dallas Morning News said that Lamar's effect on Sam Houston was \"minimal\" because there were very few housing units located north of Division and east of Collins. Brown said that \"[t]he effect on Arlington High School was huge\" since the housing in the Arlington zone north to Division had been moved to Lamar. 12th grade students that had been zoned out of Arlington High School continued to attend Arlington High School, despite being in the Lamar zone.\nIn 1982, Martin High School opened.

It was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion Texas Rangers and the National League (NL) champion Arizona Diamondbacks. The series began on October 27 and ended on November 1 with Texas winning in five games. The Rangers won their first World Series title since their founding in 1961. This marked the first time since 1989 in which consecutive championships were won by different teams from the same state.\nThe Rangers and Diamondbacks entered the 2023 MLB postseason as wild cards, making this the third World Series meeting between two wild cards following 2002 and 2014. The Rangers had home-field advantage in the series over the Diamondbacks due to their better regular season record. The Rangers and Diamondbacks split the first two games in Texas before the Rangers won three consecutive games in Arizona to win the series. Corey Seager won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award for the second time in his career.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Texas Rangers and the Arizona Diamondbacks. Both teams lost over 100 games in 2021. The teams' 174 combined wins is the lowest ever total for a non-shortened season World Series. This was the first World Series between one team that has never won in any prior appearances and another team that has never lost in any prior appearances. MLB has paired these two teams up as interleague rivals from 1998 to 2000 and in 2013, 2019, and since 2023. This was the fifth straight World Series to have games played in a venue in Texas, with Houston co-hosting in 2019, 2021, and 2022, and Arlington hosting in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, this was the first World Series since 2016 to not feature the Houston Astros or Los Angeles Dodgers.\nThe Diamondbacks won the regular season series 3\u20131, splitting a two-game series in May at Globe Life Field, and sweeping the Rangers at Chase Field in August.\nThis was the third time in World Series history that the two teams that faced each other were both from the Expansion era, the first coming in 2015 and the second in 2019.\nThis was the sixth World Series overall to be played entirely on artificial turf. Before 2023, the most recent of the six to be played in the two home team's stadiums was the 1993 World Series (which was the fourth one). However, the last \u201call-artificial turf\u201d overall (the fifth one) before 2023 had been at the neutrally located 2020 World Series, with all games played at Globe Life Field, where the first two games of 2023 were also played. 2023 is only the second World Series to be played entirely on the second generation artificial turf (with 2020 being the first).\nFinally, this was the second World Series ever to be played entirely in domed stadiums after the neutral site 2020 World Series. It was the first to be played between two domed stadium teams and with each hosting games.\n\n\n=== Texas Rangers ===\n\nDuring the regular season, the Texas Rangers were led by an AL-best offense in runs scored and were tied with the Minnesota Twins in home runs. The Rangers led the AL at the All-Star Game with six players in Adolis Garc\u00eda, Jonah Heim, Josh Jung, Corey Seager, Marcus Semien, and Nathan Eovaldi. Mid-season injuries to staff-aces Jacob deGrom and Eovaldi and subpar performance in the bullpen led the Rangers to acquire closer Aroldis Chapman, middle reliever Chris Stratton, and starting pitchers Jordan Montgomery and Max Scherzer. Despite leading the AL West for most of the season, poor play late in the year saw the team finish second in the division behind the Houston Astros; the teams had identical win-loss records, but Houston owned a better head-to-head record.\nThe Rangers qualified for the postseason as the fifth seed wild card entrant in the American League just two years removed from a 102-loss season.
