        "content": "This is a list of the most populous municipal corporations of the United States. As defined by the United States Census Bureau, an incorporated place includes cities, towns, villages, boroughs, and municipalities. A few exceptional census-designated places (CDPs) are also included in the Census Bureau's listing of incorporated places. Consolidated city-counties represent a distinct type of government that includes the entire population of a county, or county equivalent. Some consolidated city-counties, however, include multiple incorporated places. This list presents only the portion of such consolidated city-counties that are not a part of another incorporated place.\nThis list refers only to the population of individual municipalities within their defined limits; the populations of other municipalities considered suburbs of a central city are listed separately, and unincorporated areas within urban agglomerations are not included. Therefore, a different ranking is evident when considering U.S. urban areas or metropolitan areas.\n\n\n== 50 states and Washington, D.C. ==\nThis table lists the 336 incorporated places in the United States, excluding the U.S. territories, with a population of at least 100,000 as of July 1, 2023, as estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau. Five states have no cities with populations exceeding 100,000. They are: Delaware, Maine, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming.\nThe table displays:\n\nThe city rank by population as of July 1, 2023, as estimated by the United States Census Bureau\nThe city name\nThe name of the state in which the city lies\nThe city population as of July 1, 2023, as estimated by the United States Census Bureau\nThe city population as of April 1, 2020, as enumerated by the 2020 United States census\nThe city percent population change from April 1, 2020, to July 1, 2023\nThe city land area as of January 1, 2020\nThe city population density as of April 1, 2020 (residents per unit of land area)\nThe city latitude and longitude coordinates\n  \n\n \n\n\n=== Distribution ===\nThe total 2020 enumerated population of all cities over 100,000 is 96,598,047, representing 29.14% of the United States population (excluding territories) and covering a total land area of 29,588 square miles (76,630 km2). The mean city population is 301,765, and the mean density is 4,151 inhabitants per square mile (1,603/km2).\n\n\n=== Gallery ===\n\n\n== Puerto Rico ==\n  \n\nThe following table lists the five municipalities (municipios) of Puerto Rico with a population greater than 100,000 on July 1, 2023, as estimated by the United States Census Bureau.\nIf Puerto Rico were included with the broader U.S. list, San Juan would be the 58th largest city in the country.\nThe table below contains the following information:\n\nThe municipio rank by population as of July 1, 2023, as estimated by the United States Census Bureau\nThe municipio\nThe municipio population as of July 1, 2023, as estimated by the United States Census Bureau\nThe municipio population as of April 1, 2020, as enumerated by the 2020 United States census\nThe municipio percent population change from April 1, 2020, to July 1, 2023\nThe municipio land area as of January 1, 2020\nThe municipio population density as of April 1, 2020 (residents per land area)\nThe municipio latitude and longitude coordinates\n\n\n== Other U.S. territories ==\nAs of 2023, four U.S. territories — American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands — have no cities with at least 100,000 people.\n\n\n== Census-designated places ==\n  \nThe following table lists U.S. census-designated places (CDPs) with populations of at least 100,000 according to the 2020 census. A CDP is a concentration of population identified by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes. CDPs are delineated for each decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places such as cities, towns and villages. CDPs are populated areas that lack separate municipal government, but which otherwise physic\nThe following is a list of incorporated places in the United States with a population density of over 10,000 people per square mile. As defined by the United States Census Bureau, an incorporated place is a place that has a self-governing local government and as such has been \"incorporated\" by the state it is in. Each state has different laws defining how a place can be incorporated. An \"incorporated place\" as recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau can designate a variety of places, such as a city, town, village, borough, and township.\nThe other type of place defined by the U.S. Census Bureau for statistical purposes are census-designated places. Census-designated places are distinct from incorporated places because they do not have a local government and thus depend on higher government bodies, such as a county, for governance. Census-designated places are defined as being in an unincorporated area. Census-designated places that have a population density of over 10,000 people per square mile are listed in a separate table below. The five boroughs of New York City, and the census-designated places of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands that have densities over 10,000, are also listed in separate tables below.\n\n\n== Incorporated places with a density of over 10,000 people per square mile ==\nThe following data about the most densely populated incorporated places in the United States is from the U.S. Census Bureau and is from the 2020 U.S. Census, except for the tables on Puerto Rico, which show data from the 2000 US Census. The following ranking is made up of incorporated places of any population, but also of interest may be lists compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau of all places with at least 50,000 population, arranged alphabetically by state, and ranked by total population; the population density for each place is also given in the lists.\nThe population density is calculated by dividing the population by the land area so that it represents the number of people living in one square mile of land area. The population densities listed in the table below do not work out to be exactly the result of dividing the listed population by the listed land area because the land areas have been rounded off to two decimal places, but the population densities were calculated before rounding the land area figures. The land area figures are calculated using the U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER system. The U.S. Census Bureau has released the exact land area figures for all places in the U.S. in square meters and square miles; the exact land areas are the figures used for calculating the population densities seen in the table below.\n\n\n=== Cities ===\nThe list below only includes incorporated places of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Unincorporated census-designated places, places in Puerto Rico, and the five boroughs of New York City are all listed in separate tables below.\nThose cities that are not a part of a larger city's metropolitan area are in bold.\n\n\n=== Census-designated places ===\nThe following is a list of unincorporated census-designated places with population densities of over 10,000 people per square mile as of the 2010 U.S. Census. The rank column indicates the rank the place would have if census-designated places were included in the above table of incorporated places.\n\n\n=== New York City boroughs ===\nThe following lists the population densities of the five boroughs of New York City as of the 2020 U.S. Census. The rank column indicates the rank they would have if included in the above table of incorporated places. Staten Island has a population density below 10,000, but it is included for comparative purposes.\n\n\n=== Puerto Rico ===\n\nThe following lists the census-designated places in Puerto Rico that have a population density of over 10,000 people per square mile as of the 2000 U.S. Census. The census-designated places in Puerto Rico include zonas urbanas (urban areas) and comunidades (communities). The municipality, or mu\nThe states and territories included in the United States Census Bureau's statistics for the United States population, ethnicity, and most other categories include the 50 states and Washington, D.C. Separate statistics are maintained for the five permanently inhabited territories of the United States: Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands.\nAs of April 1, 2010, the date of the 2010 United States Census, the nine most populous U.S. states contain slightly more than half of the total population. The 25 least populous states contain less than one-sixth of the total population. California, the most populous state, contains more people than the 21 least populous states combined, and Wyoming, the least populous state, has a population less than any of the 31 most populous U.S. cities.\n\n\n== Method ==\nThe United States Census counts the persons residing in the United States including citizens, non-citizen permanent residents and non-citizen long-term visitors. Civilian and military federal employees serving abroad and their dependents are counted in their home state.\n\n\n== Electoral apportionment ==\nEvery 10 years, the U.S. Census Bureau is charged with making an actual count of all residents by state and territory.  The accuracy of this count is then tested after the fact, and sometimes statistically significant undercounts or overcounts occur.  For example, for the 2020 decennial census, 14 states had significant miscounts ranging from 1.5% to 6.6%.  While these adjustments may be reflected in government programs over the following decade, the 10-year representative apportionments discussed below are not changed to reflect the miscount.\n\n\n=== House of Representatives ===\nBased on this decennial census, each state is allocated a portion of the 435 fixed seats in the United States House of Representatives (until the early 20th century, the apportionment process generally increased the size of the House based on the results of the census until the size of the House was capped by the Reapportionment Act of 1929), with each state guaranteed at least one Representative. The allocation is based on each state's proportion of the combined population of the fifty states (not including the District of Columbia, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, or the United States Virgin Islands).\n\n\n=== Electoral College ===\nThe Electoral College, every four years, elects the President and Vice President of the United States based on the popular vote in each state and the District of Columbia. Each state's number of votes in the Electoral College is equal to its number of members in the Senate plus members in the House of Representatives.\nThe Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution additionally grants the District of Columbia (D.C.), which is not part of any state, as many Electoral College votes as it would have if it were a state, while having no more votes than the least populous state (currently, Wyoming). Since the U.S. Constitution guarantees every state at least one member of the U.S. House of Representatives and two members of the U.S. Senate, every state has at least three Electoral College votes. Thus, the Electoral College has 538 members (100 senators, plus 435 representatives due to the limit imposed by the Reapportionment Act of 1929, plus 3 members for the District of Columbia). Territories of the United States such as Puerto Rico are not included in the Electoral College: people in those territories cannot vote directly for the President of the United States, although they may participate in the partisan nominating primaries and caucuses.\n\n\n== State and territory rankings ==\n\n* — non-voting member of the House of Representatives.\n\n\n== Summary of population by region ==\n\nColumn header abbreviations: # = Rank, Geo. = Geographic\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nGeneral\n\"National Totals: Vintage 2015\".

Also, the United States Census Bureau and the California Department of Finance use different methods for estimating population, so state estimates will differ from those given here.\n\n\n== Map ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of cities and towns in California\nList of cities and towns in the San Francisco Bay Area\nList of California urban areas\nList of United States cities by population\n\n\n== References ==\nThis list tracks and ranks the population of the top 10 largest cities and other urban places in the United States by decade, as reported by each decennial United States census, starting with the 1790 Census. For 1790 through 1990, tables are taken from the U.S Census Bureau's \"Population of the 100 Largest Cities and Other Urban Places in the United States: 1790 to 1990.\" For year 2000 rankings, data from the Census Bureau's tally of \"Cities with 100,000 or More Population Ranked by Selected Subject\" is used. The 2010 rankings are based on the 2010 census results.\nThe Census Bureau's definition of an \"urban place\" has included a variety of designations, including city, town, township, village, borough, and municipality. The top 10 urban areas in 1790 consisted of various places designated as cities, towns and townships. The top 10 urban areas in 2010 are all separate incorporated places.\nThis list generally refers only to the population of individual urban places within their defined limits at the time of the indicated census. Some of these places have since been annexed or merged into other cities. Other places may have expanded their borders due to such annexation or consolidation. For example, after the 1898 consolidation of New York City, the Census Bureau has defined all the boroughs within its city limits as one \"urban place\". Similarly, Philadelphia's population has included the census counts within both the former urban areas of Northern Liberties, Pennsylvania and Southwark, Pennsylvania ever since Philadelphia's 1854 consolidation.\n\n\n== 1790 ==\n\nWhen the United States declared independence in 1776, Philadelphia was its most populous city. By the time the first U.S. census count was completed in 1790, New York City had already grown to be 14% more populous than Philadelphia (though Philadelphia still had the larger metropolitan population in 1790). Note that, in 1790, New York City consisted of the entire island of Manhattan and that Philadelphia only included the most central neighborhoods of the city.\n\nThe total population of these 11 cities was 152,087.\n\n\n== 1800 ==\n\nRankings based on population data from the second United States Census.\n\nThe total population of these 10 cities was 216,346.\n\n\n== 1810 ==\n\nRankings based on population data from the third United States Census.\n\nThe total population of these 10 cities was 329,346.\n\n\n== 1820 ==\n\nRankings based on population data drawn the fourth United States Census.\n\nThe total population of these 10 cities was 405,869.

State by state, the highest number of Hispanic Americans could be found in California (15.6 million), Texas (11.4 million), Florida (5.7 million), New York state (4.0 million), and Puerto Rico (3.3 million). Meanwhile, the highest proportions of Hispanic Americans were in Puerto Rico (99.1%), New Mexico (47.8%), California (39.4%), Texas (39.4%), and Arizona (30.8%).\nThroughout the country, there are 343 cities with a population over 100,000. 48 of them had Hispanic majorities, and in 74 more cities, between 30% and 50% of the population identified as Hispanic. Out of the 48 majority-Hispanic cities, 27 were in California, 9 were in Texas, and 5 were in Puerto Rico. Florida and New Jersey had two each, while New Mexico, Nevada, Arizona, and Pennsylvania all had one.\nIn 2020, the largest cities which had a Hispanic majority were San Antonio, Texas (1,430,000), El Paso, Texas (679,000), Fresno, California (542,000), Miami, Florida (442,000), and Bakersfield, California (403,000).\n\n\n== List ==\nThe list below consists of each city (or city-equivalent) in the fifty states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico with a population over 100,000 and a Hispanic proportion over 30% as of the 2020 Census. It includes the city's total population, the number of Hispanic people in the city, and the percentage of people in the city who are Hispanic. The table is initially sorted by the Hispanic proportion of each city but is sortable by any of its columns, as can be found by clicking the table headers.\nMunicipalities in Puerto Rico have their rows shaded in yellow\nCensus-Designated Places have their rows shaded in green\n\n\n== See also ==\nHispanic and Latino Americans\nList of U.S. states by Hispanic and Latino population\nList of majority-Hispanic or Latino counties in the United States\nList of U.S. cities with large Black populations\nList of U.S. communities with Asian-American majority populations\nList of United States cities by percentage of white population\n\n\n== References ==\nIn the United States, a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is a geographical region with a relatively high population density at its core and close economic ties throughout the region. Such regions are not legally incorporated as a city or town would be and are not legal administrative divisions like counties or separate entities such as states. As a result, sometimes the precise definition of a given metropolitan area will vary between sources. The statistical criteria for a standard metropolitan area were defined in 1949 and redefined as a metropolitan statistical area in 1983.\nDue to suburbanization, the typical metropolitan area is polycentric rather than being centered around a large historic core city such as New York City or Chicago. Some metropolitan areas include more than one large historic core city; examples include the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, Virginia Beach–Norfolk–Newport News (Hampton Roads), Riverside–San Bernardino (Inland Empire), and Minneapolis–Saint Paul (Twin Cities). \nMSAs are defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which is part of the Executive Office of the President, and are used by the U.S. Census Bureau and other U.S. federal government agencies for statistical purposes.\n\n\n== Definitions ==\n\nThe U.S. Office of Management and Budget defines a set of core based statistical areas (CBSAs) throughout the country, which are composed of counties and county equivalents. \nCBSAs are delineated on the basis of a central contiguous area of relatively high population density, known as an urban area. The counties containing the core urban area are known as the \"central counties\" of the CBSA; these are defined as having at least 50% of their population living in urban areas of at least 10,000 in population. Additional surrounding counties, known as \"outlying counties\", can be included in the CBSA if these counties have strong social and economic ties to the central county or counties as measured by commuting and employment. Outlying counties are included in the CBSA if 25% of the workers living in the county work in the central county or counties, or if 25% of the employment in the county is held by workers who live in the central county or counties.\nAdjacent CBSAs are merged into a single CBSA when the central county or counties of one CBSA qualify as an outlying county or counties to the other CBSAs. One or more CBSAs may be grouped together or combined to form a larger statistical entity known as a combined statistical area (CSA) when the employment interchange measure (EIM) reaches 15% or more.\nCBSAs are subdivided into MSAs (formed around urban areas of at least 50,000 in population) and micropolitan statistical areas (μSAs), which are CBSAs built around an urban area of at least 10,000 in population but less than 50,000 in population. Some metropolitan areas may include multiple cities below 50,000 people, but combined have over 50,000 people. Previous terms that are no longer used to describe these regions include \"standard metropolitan statistical area\" (SMSA) and \"primary metropolitan statistical area\" (PMSA).\nOn January 19, 2021, OMB submitted a regulation for public comment that would increase the minimum population needed for an urban area population to be a metropolitan statistical area to be increased from 50,000 to 100,000. It ultimately decided to keep the minimum at 50,000 for the 2020 cycle.\nOn July 21, 2023, the Office of Management and Budget released revised delineations of the various CBSAs in the United States.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Census Bureau created the metropolitan district for the 1910 census as a standardized classification for large urban centers and their surrounding areas. The original threshold for a metropolitan district was 200,000, but was lowered to 100,000 in 1930 and 50,000 in 1940. The metropolitan districts were replaced by standard metropolitan areas (SMAs) in the 1950 census, which were defined by the Bureau of the Budget (now the Office of Management\nThis is a list of the 50 states, the 5 territories, and the District of Columbia by population density, population size, and land area. It also includes a sortable table of density by states, territories, divisions, and regions by population rank and land area, and a sortable table for density by states, divisions, regions, and territories in square miles and square kilometers.\nThe population density of the United States is lower than that of many other countries because of the United States' large land area. There are large, sparsely populated areas in parts of the US, like the east-to-west stretch extending from the outskirts of Seattle all the way to Minneapolis, or the north-to-south portion from northern Montana to southern New Mexico, excluding Denver and Albuquerque. For comparison, the population density of the U.S. is 1/15 that of South Korea and 1/12 that of India and the Netherlands. On the other hand, it is over 8 times higher than that of Canada and over 9 times higher than that of Australia.\n\n\n== States and territories by population density ==\nPopulation density is defined as the population divided by land area. Data are from the US Census unless otherwise specified. Population data are for the year 2023 and area data are for the year 2010. Some population estimates for territories are from the United Nations Commission on Population and Development.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of U.S. states and territories by area\nDemographics of the United States\nList of U.S. states by population\nList of United States cities by population density\nList of U.S. states by historical population\nList of U.S. states by African-American population\nList of U.S. states by fertility rate\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThis article contains tables of U.S. cities and metropolitan areas with information about the population aged 5 and over that speaks Spanish at home.

A portion of it, the Honolulu District, is sometimes regarded as the \"city\" for statistical purposes, although it has no government separate from that of the City and County as a whole.

Thus for Hawaii, the largest CDPs are ranked, as of the 2020 United States census.\nNote 2: The 4 municipalities of the Northern Mariana Islands are listed. Each municipality is divided into smaller villages, but the municipalities are considered the primary subdivisions (as in how Saipan is usually listed as the capital rather than Capitol Hill, Saipan). The five largest villages are Garapan (3,983), Dandan (3,280), Koblerville (2,493), Finasisu (2,491) and Kagman III (2,402), with Capitol Hill being the 19th largest village at 1,028 people.\nNote 3: The most populous sub-districts of the U.S. Virgin Islands (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) are listed.

The number of murders includes nonnegligent manslaughter. This list is based on the reporting. In most cases, the city and the reporting agency are identical. However, in some cases such as Charlotte, Honolulu, and Las Vegas, the reporting agency has more than one municipality.\nMurder is the only statistic that all agencies are required to report. Consequently, some agencies do not report all the crimes. If components are missing the total is adjusted to 0.\n\n\n== Note about population ==\nOften, one obtains very different results depending on whether crime rates are measured for the city jurisdiction or the metropolitan area.\nInformation is voluntarily submitted by each jurisdiction and some jurisdictions do not appear in the table because they either did not submit data or they did not meet deadlines.\nThe FBI website has this disclaimer on population estimates:\n\nFor the 2019 population estimates used in this table, the FBI computed individual rates of growth from one year to the next for every city/town and county using 2010 decennial population counts and 2011 through 2018 population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau. Each agency’s rates of growth were averaged; that average was then applied and added to its 2018 Census population estimate to derive the agency’s 2019 population estimate.\n\n\n== Crime rates ==\n\nNotes:\n1 The figures are shown in this column for the offense of rape were reported using only the revised Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) definition of rape. See the data declaration for further explanation. \n2 The FBI does not publish arson data unless it receives it from either the agency or the state for all 12 months of the calendar year. \n3 The population of the city of Mobile, Alabama, includes 55,819 inhabitants from the jurisdiction of the Mobile County Sheriff's Department. \n4 Because of changes in the state/ or local agency's reporting practices, figures are not comparable to previous years' data. \n5 The FBI determined that the agency's data were underreported. Consequently, those data are not included in this table. \n6 Arson offenses are also reported by the Louisville Fire Department. Those figures are not included in this table. \n7 Arson offenses are reported by the Toledo Fire Department; therefore, those figures are not included in this report. \n8 This agency/state submits rape data classified according to the legacy UCR definition; therefore, the rape offense and violent crime total, which rape is a part of, is not included in this table. See the data declaration for further explanation.\n\n\n== Criticism of ranking crime data ==\nThe FBI web site recommends against using its data for ranking because these rankings lead to simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that often create misleading perceptions adversely affecting cities and counties, along with their residents. The FBI web site also recommends against using its data to judge how effective law enforcement agencies are, since there are many factors other than law enforcement  that influence crime rates.\nIn November 2007, the executive board of the American Society of Criminology (ASC) went further than the FBI itself, and approved a resolution opposing not only the use of the ratings to judge police departments, but also any development of city crime rankings from FBI Uniform Crime Reports (UCRs) at all. The resolution opposed these rankings on the grounds that they \"fail to account for the many conditions affecting crime rates\" and \"divert attention from the individual and community characteristics that elevate crime in all cities\", though it did not provide sources or further elaborate on these claims. The resolution states the rankings \"r\nThere are 3,244 counties and county equivalents in the United States. The 50 states of the United States are divided into 3,007 political subdivisions of states called counties. Two hundred thirty-seven other local governments and geographic places are also first-order administrative divisions of their respective state/district/territory, but are not called counties. The  United States Census Bureau refers to the latter as county equivalents. The 237 county equivalents include the District of Columbia and 100 equivalents in U.S. territories (such as those in Puerto Rico). The large majority of counties and equivalents were organized by 1970. Since that time, most creations, boundary changes and dissolutions have occurred in Alaska, Virginia, and Connecticut.\nAmong the 50 states, 44 are partitioned entirely into counties, with no county equivalents. Louisiana is instead divided into 64 equivalent parishes, while Alaska is divided into 19 equivalent boroughs and 11 sparsely populated census areas, the latter also known collectively as the unorganized borough. Virginia is composed of a mixture of 95 counties and 38 independent cities. Maryland, Missouri and Nevada are each composed entirely of counties, except that each also has exactly one independent city: Baltimore, St. Louis, and Carson City, respectively. The District of Columbia is a single federal district that is not part of any state or county. All of the above 136 exceptional cases are reckoned as county equivalents. The number of counties (or equivalents) per state ranges from the three counties of Delaware, to the 254 counties of Texas. In New England, where the town model predominates, several counties have no corresponding local governments, existing only as historical, legal, and census boundaries, such as the counties of Rhode Island, as well as eight of Massachusetts' 14 counties. On June 6, 2022, the U.S. Census Bureau formally recognized Connecticut's nine councils of government as county equivalents instead of the state's eight counties. Connecticut's eight historical counties continue to exist in name only, and are no longer considered for statistical purposes. In total, the 50 states consist of 3,144 counties and equivalents. \nSimilarly, the Census Bureau treats 100 subdivisions of the territories of the United States as county equivalents. These are the 78 municipalities of Puerto Rico, the three major islands of the U.S. Virgin Islands, the three districts and two atolls of American Samoa, Guam as a single island and county equivalent, the four municipalities of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the nine island territories of the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands.

State by state, the highest number of black Americans could be found in Texas (3.96 million), Florida (3.70 million), Georgia (3.54 million), New York (3.53 million), and California (2.83 million). Meanwhile, the highest proportions of African Americans were in the District of Columbia (44.17%), Mississippi (37.94%), Louisiana (33.13%), Georgia (33.03%), and Maryland (32.01%).\nThroughout the country, there are 342 cities with a population over 100,000. 19 of them had black (alone or in combination) majorities, and in 46 more cities, between 30% and 50% of the population identified as black. Out of the 19 majority-black cities, four were in Georgia and Louisiana and Alabama had three each. Meanwhile, the states of Florida, Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey, Texas, Virginia, Tennessee, Massachusetts, Maryland, and Mississippi each had one majority-black city.\nIn 2020, the largest cities which had a black majority were Detroit, Michigan (population 639K), Memphis, Tennessee (population 633K), Baltimore, Maryland (population 586K), New Orleans, Louisiana (population 384K), and Cleveland, Ohio (population 373K).\n\n\n== List ==\nThe list below displays each city (or city-equivalent) in the fifty states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico with a population over 100,000 and a Black proportion over 30% as of the 2020 Census.

An urban area is defined by the Census Bureau as a contiguous set of census blocks that are \"densely developed residential, commercial, and other nonresidential areas\". \nUrban areas consist of a densely-settled urban core, plus surrounding developed areas that meet certain density criteria. Since urban areas are composed of census blocks and not cities, counties, or county-equivalents, urban area boundaries may consist of partial areas of these political units. Urban areas are distinguished from rural areas: any area not part of an urban area is considered to be rural by the Census Bureau. The list in this article includes urban areas with a population of at least 50,000, but urban areas may have as few as 5,000 residents or 2,000 housing units. Some cities may also be a part of two or more urban areas, as is the case for Huntsville, and the smaller Huntsville Southeast.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nFor the 2020 census, the Census Bureau redefined the classification of urban areas. The criteria were finalized on March 24, 2022, after a period of public input, and the final results of delineation were published on December 29, 2022. Key changes for the 2020 criteria included:\n\nThe removal of the distinction between urbanized areas and urban clusters. Urbanized areas were previously defined as urban areas with at least 50,000 residents, and urban clusters were urban areas with less than 50,000. All qualifying areas are now designated as urban areas.\nThe use of housing unit density as an alternative minimum for inclusion: either 2,000 housing units or a population of 5,000 may qualify an area as an urban area.

Cities may be defined as the cities proper, the extent of their urban area, or their metropolitan regions.\n\n\n== Definitions ==\n\n\n=== City proper (administrative) ===\n\nA city can be defined by its administrative boundaries, otherwise known as city proper. UNICEF defines city proper as, \"the population living within the administrative boundaries of a city or controlled directly from the city by a single authority.\" A city proper is a locality defined according to legal or political boundaries and an administratively recognised urban status that is usually characterised by some form of local government. Cities proper and their boundaries and population data may not include suburbs.\nThe use of city proper as defined by administrative boundaries may not include suburban areas where an important proportion of the population working or studying in the city lives. Because of this definition, the city proper population figure may differ greatly from the urban area population figure, as many cities are amalgamations of smaller municipalities (Australia), and conversely, many Chinese cities govern territories that extend well beyond the core urban area into suburban and rural areas. The Chinese municipality of Chongqing, which is the largest city proper in the world by population, comprises a huge administrative area of 82,403 km2, around the size of Austria. However, more than 70% of its 30-million population are agricultural workers living in a rural setting.\n\n\n=== Urban area ===\n\nA city can be defined as a conditionally contiguous urban area, without regard to territorial or other boundaries inside an urban area. UNICEF defines urban area as follows:\n\nThe definition of \"urban\" varies from country to country, and, with periodic reclassification, can also vary within one country over time, making direct comparisons difficult. An urban area can be defined by one or more of the following: administrative criteria or political boundaries (e.g., area within the jurisdiction of a municipality or town committee), a threshold population size (where the minimum for an urban settlement is typically in the region of 2,000 people, although this varies globally between 200 and 50,000), population density, economic function (e.g., where a significant majority of the population is not primarily engaged in agriculture, or where there is surplus employment) or the presence of urban characteristics (e.g., paved streets, electric lighting, sewerage).\nAccording to Demographia, an urban area is a continuously built up land mass of urban development that is within a labor market (metropolitan area or metropolitan region) and contains no rural land.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\n\nA city can be defined by the inhabitants of its demographic population, as by metropolitan area, or labour market area. UNICEF defines metropolitan area as follows:\n\nA formal local government area comprising the urban area as a whole and its primary commuter areas, typically formed around a city with a large concentration of people (i.e., a population of at least 100,000). In addition to the city proper, a metropolitan area includes both the surrounding territory with urban levels of residential density and some additional lower-density areas that are adjacent to and linked to the city (e.g., through frequent transport, road linkages or commuting facilities).\nIn many countries, metropolitan areas are established either with an official organisation or only for statistical purposes. In the United States, metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In the Philippines, metropolitan areas have an official agency, such as Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), which manages Manila metropolitan area. Similar agencies exist in Indonesia, such as Jabodetabekjur Development Cooperati",
