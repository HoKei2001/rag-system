        "content": "The Rubik's Cube is a 3D combination puzzle invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ernő Rubik. Originally called the Magic Cube, the puzzle was licensed by Rubik to be sold by Pentangle Puzzles in the UK in 1978, and then by Ideal Toy Corp in 1980 via businessman Tibor Laczi and Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer. The cube was released internationally in 1980 and became one of the most recognized icons in popular culture. It won the 1980 German Game of the Year special award for Best Puzzle. As of January 2024, around 500 million cubes had been sold worldwide, making it the world's bestselling puzzle game and bestselling toy. The Rubik's Cube was inducted into the US National Toy Hall of Fame in 2014.\nOn the original, classic Rubik's Cube, each of the six faces was covered by nine stickers, with each face in one of six solid colours: white, red, blue, orange, green, and yellow. Some later versions of the cube have been updated to use coloured plastic panels instead. Since 1988, the arrangement of colours has been standardised, with white opposite yellow, blue opposite green, and orange opposite red, and with the red, white, and blue arranged clockwise, in that order. On early cubes, the position of the colours varied from cube to cube.\n\nAn internal pivot mechanism enables each face to turn independently, thus mixing up the colours. For the puzzle to be solved, each face must be returned to having only one colour. The Cube has inspired other designers to create a number of similar puzzles with various numbers of sides, dimensions, and mechanisms.\nAlthough the Rubik's Cube reached the height of its mainstream popularity in the 1980s, it is still widely known and used. Many speedcubers continue to practice it and similar puzzles, and to compete for the fastest times in various categories. Since 2003, the World Cube Association (WCA), the international governing body of the Rubik's Cube, has organised competitions worldwide and has recognised world records.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Precursors ===\n\nIn March 1970, Larry D. Nichols invented a 2x2x2 \"Puzzle with Pieces Rotatable in Groups\" and filed a Canadian patent application for it. Nichols's cube was held together by magnets. Nichols was granted U.S. patent 3,655,201 on 11 April 1972, two years before Rubik invented his Cube.\nOn 9 April 1970, Frank Fox applied to patent an \"amusement device\", a type of sliding puzzle on a spherical surface with \"at least two 3×3 arrays\" intended to be used for the game of noughts and crosses. He received his UK patent (1344259) on 16 January 1974.\n\n\n=== Rubik's invention ===\nIn the mid-1970s, Ernő Rubik worked at the Department of Interior Design at the Academy of Applied Arts and Crafts in Budapest. Although it is widely reported that the Cube was built as a teaching tool to help his students understand 3D objects, his actual purpose was solving the structural problem of moving the parts independently without the entire mechanism falling apart.  He did not realise that he had created a puzzle until the first time he scrambled his new Cube and then tried to restore it. Rubik applied for a patent in Hungary for his \"Magic Cube\" (Hungarian: bűvös kocka) on 30 January 1975, and HU170062 was granted later that year.\n\nThe first test batches of the Magic Cube were produced in late 1977 and released in toy shops in Budapest. Magic Cube was held together with interlocking plastic pieces that prevented the puzzle from being easily pulled apart, unlike the magnets in Nichols's design. With Ernő Rubik's permission, businessman Tibor Laczi took a Cube to Germany's Nuremberg Toy Fair in February 1979 in an attempt to popularise it. It was noticed by Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer, and they signed a deal with Ideal Toys in September 1979 to release the Magic Cube worldwide. Ideal wanted at least a recognisable name to trademark; that arrangement put Rubik in the spotlight because the Magic Cube was renamed after its inventor in 1980. The\nThe Rubik's Cube group \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        G\n        ,\n        ⋅\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (G,\\cdot )}\n  \n  represents the structure of the Rubik's Cube mechanical puzzle. Each element of the set \n  \n    \n      \n        G\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle G}\n  \n corresponds to a cube move, which is the effect of any sequence of rotations of the cube's faces. With this representation, not only can any cube move be represented, but any position of the cube as well, by detailing the cube moves required to rotate the solved cube into that position. Indeed with the solved position as a starting point, there is a one-to-one correspondence between each of the legal positions of the Rubik's Cube and the elements of \n  \n    \n      \n        G\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle G}\n  \n. The group operation \n  \n    \n      \n        ⋅\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\cdot }\n  \n is the composition of cube moves, corresponding to the result of performing one cube move after another.   \nThe Rubik's Cube is constructed by labeling each of the 48 non-center facets with the integers 1 to 48. Each configuration of the cube can be represented as a permutation of the labels 1 to 48, depending on the position of each facet. Using this representation, the solved cube is the identity permutation which leaves the cube unchanged, while the twelve cube moves that rotate a layer of the cube 90 degrees are represented by their respective permutations. The Rubik's Cube group is the subgroup of the symmetric group \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          S\n          \n            48\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle S_{48}}\n  \n generated by the six permutations corresponding to the six clockwise cube moves. With this construction, any configuration of the cube reachable through a sequence of cube moves is within the group. Its operation \n  \n    \n      \n        ⋅\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\cdot }\n  \n refers to the composition of two permutations; within the cube, this refers to combining two sequences of cube moves together, doing one after the other. The Rubik's Cube group is non-abelian as composition of cube moves is not commutative; doing two sequences of cube moves in a different order can result in a different configuration.\n\n\n== Cube moves ==\nA \n  \n    \n      \n        3\n        ×\n        3\n        ×\n        3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 3\\times 3\\times 3}\n  \n Rubik's Cube consists of \n  \n    \n      \n        6\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 6}\n  \n faces, each with \n  \n    \n      \n        9\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 9}\n  \n colored squares called facelets, for a total of \n  \n    \n      \n        54\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 54}\n  \n facelets.

It has qualities in common with both the 3×3×3 Rubik's Cube and the 4×4×4 Rubik's Revenge, and solution strategies for both can be applied.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Professor's Cube was invented by Udo Krell in 1981. Out of the many designs that were proposed, Udo Krell's design was the first 5×5×5 design that was manufactured and sold. Uwe Mèffert manufactured the cube and sold it in Hong Kong in 1983.\nIdeal Toys, who first popularized the original 3x3x3 Rubik's cube, marketed the puzzle in Germany as the \"Rubik's Wahn\" (German: Rubik's Craze). When the cube was marketed in Japan, it was marketed under the name \"Professor's Cube\". Mèffert reissued the cube under the name \"Professor's Cube\" in the 1990s.\nThe early versions of the 5×5×5 cube sold at Barnes & Noble were marketed under the name \"Professor's Cube\" but currently, Barnes and Noble sells cubes that are simply called \"5×5 Cube.\" Mefferts.com used to sell a limited edition version of the 5×5×5 cube called the Professor's Cube. This version had colored tiles rather than stickers. Verdes Innovations sells a version called the V-Cube 5.\n\n\n== Workings ==\n\nThe original Professor's Cube design by Udo Krell works by using an expanded 3×3×3 cube as a mantle with the center edge pieces and corners sticking out from the spherical center of identical mechanism to the 3×3×3 cube. All non-central pieces have extensions that fit into slots on the outer pieces of the 3×3×3, which keeps them from falling out of the cube while making a turn. The fixed centers have two sections (one visible, one hidden) which can turn independently. This feature is unique to the original design.\nThe Eastsheen version of the puzzle uses a different mechanism. The fixed centers hold the centers next to the central edges in place, which in turn hold the outer edges. The non-central edges hold the corners in place, and the internal sections of the corner pieces do not reach the center of the cube.\nThe V-Cube 5 mechanism, designed by Panagiotis Verdes, has elements in common with both. The corners reach to the center of the puzzle (like the original mechanism) and the center pieces hold the central edges in place (like the Eastsheen mechanism). The middle edges and center pieces adjacent to them make up the supporting frame and these have extensions which hold the rest of the pieces together. This allows smooth and fast rotation and created what was arguably the fastest and most durable version of the puzzle available at that time. Unlike the original 5×5×5 design, the V-Cube 5 mechanism was designed to allow speedcubing. Most current production 5×5×5 speed cubes have mechanisms based on Verdes' patent.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Stability and durability ==\n\nThe original Professor's Cube is inherently more delicate than the 3×3×3 Rubik's Cube because of the much greater number of moving parts and pieces. Because of its fragile design, the Rubik's brand Professor's Cube is not suitable for Speedcubing. Applying excessive force to the cube when twisting it may result in broken pieces.  Both the Eastsheen 5×5×5 and the V-Cube 5 are designed with different mechanisms in an attempt to remedy the fragility of the original design.\n\n\n== Permutations ==\nThere are 98 pieces on the exterior of the cube: 8 corners, 36 edges, and 54 centers (48 movable, 6 fixed).\nAny permutation of the corners is possible, including odd permutations, giving 8! possible arrangements. Seven of the corners can be independently rotated, and the orientation of the eighth corner depends on the other seven, giving 37 (or 2,187) combinations.\nThere are 54 centers. Six of these (the center square of each face) are fixed in position. The rest consist of two sets of 24 centers. Within each set there are four centers of each color. Each set can be arranged in 24! different ways.\nThe Rubik's Revenge (also known as the 4×4×4 Rubik's Cube) is a 4×4×4 version of the Rubik's Cube. It was released in 1981. Invented by Péter Sebestény, the cube was nearly called the Sebestény Cube until a somewhat last-minute decision changed the puzzle's name to attract fans of the original Rubik's Cube. Unlike the original puzzle (and other puzzles with an odd number of layers like the 5×5×5 cube), it has no fixed faces: the center faces (four per face) are free to move to different positions.\nMethods for solving the 3×3×3 cube work for the edges and corners of the 4×4×4 cube, as long as one has correctly identified the relative positions of the colours—since the center faces can no longer be used for identification.\n\n\n== Mechanics ==\n\nThe puzzle consists of 56 unique miniature cubes (\"cubies\") on the surface. These consist of 24 centres which show one colour each, 24 edges which show two colours each, and 8 corners which show three colours each. The original Rubik's Revenge can be taken apart without much difficulty, typically by turning one side through a 30° angle and prying an edge upward until it dislodges.\nThe original mechanism designed by Sebestény uses a grooved ball to hold the centre pieces in place. The edge pieces are held in place by the centres and the corners are held in place by the edges, much like the original cube. There are three mutually perpendicular grooves for the centre pieces to slide through. Each groove is only wide enough to allow one row of centre pieces to slide through it. The ball is shaped to prevent the centre pieces of the other row from sliding, ensuring that the ball remains aligned with the outside of the cube. Turning one of the centre layers moves either just that layer or the ball as well.\nThe Eastsheen version of the cube, which is slightly smaller at 6cm to an edge, has a completely different mechanism. Its mechanism is very similar to Eastsheen's version of the Professor's cube, instead of the ball-core mechanism. There are 42 pieces (36 movable and six fixed) completely hidden within the cube, corresponding to the centre rows on the Professor's Cube. This design is more durable than the original and also allows for screws to be used to tighten or loosen the cube. The central spindle is specially shaped to prevent it from becoming misaligned with the exterior of the cube. Nearly all manufacturers of 4×4×4 use similar mechanisms.\nThere are 24 edge pieces which show two coloured sides each, and eight corner pieces which show three colours. Each corner piece or pair of edge pieces shows a unique colour combination, but not all combinations are present (for example, there is no piece with both red and orange sides, if red and orange are on opposite sides of the solved Cube). The location of these cubes relative to one another can be altered by twisting the layers of the cube, but the location of the coloured sides relative to one another in the completed state of the puzzle cannot be altered: it is fixed by the relative positions of the centre squares and the distribution of colour combinations on edge and corner pieces. Edge pairs are often referred to as \"dedges,\" from double edges.\nFor most recent cubes, the colours of the stickers are red opposite orange, yellow opposite white, and green opposite blue. However, there also exist cubes with alternative colour arrangements (yellow opposite green, blue opposite white and red opposite orange).  The Eastsheen version has purple (opposite red) instead of orange.\n\n\n=== Permutations ===\n\nThere are 8 corners, 24 edges and 24 centres.\nAny permutation of the corners is possible, including odd permutations. Seven of the corners can be independently rotated, and the orientation of the eighth depends on the other seven, giving 8!×37 combinations.\nThere are 24 centres, which can be arranged in 24! different ways. Assuming that the four centres of each colour are indistinguishable, the number of permutations is reduced to 24!/(246) arrangements\nOptimal solutions for the Rubik's Cube are solutions that are the shortest in some sense. There are two common ways to measure the length of a solution.  The first is to count the number of quarter turns. The second is to count the number of outer-layer twists, called \"face turns\". A move to turn an outer layer two quarter (90°) turns in the same direction would be counted as two moves in the quarter turn metric (QTM), but as one turn in the face metric (FTM, or HTM \"Half Turn Metric\", or OBTM \"Outer Block Turn Metric\").\nThe maximal number of face turns needed to solve any instance of the Rubik's Cube is 20, and the maximal number of quarter turns is 26. These numbers are also the diameters of the corresponding  Cayley graphs of the Rubik's Cube group. In STM (slice turn metric), the minimal number of turns is unknown.\nThere are many algorithms to solve scrambled Rubik's Cubes. An algorithm that solves a cube in the minimum number of moves is known as God's algorithm.\n\n\n== Move notation ==\n\nTo denote a sequence of moves on the 3×3×3 Rubik's Cube, this article uses \"Singmaster notation\", which was developed by David Singmaster.\nThe following are standard moves, which do not move centre cubies of any face to another location:\nThe letters L, R, F, B, U, and D indicate a clockwise quarter turn of the left, right, front, back, up, and down face respectively. A half turn (i.e. 2 quarter turns in the same direction) are indicated by appending a 2. A counterclockwise turn is indicated by appending a prime symbol ( ′ ).\nHowever, because these notations are human-oriented, we use clockwise as positive, and not mathematically oriented, which is counterclockwise as positive.\nThe following are non-standard moves\nNon-standard moves are usually represented with lowercase letters in contrast to the standard moves above.\nMoving centre cubies of faces to other locations:\nThe letters M, S and E are used to denote the turning of a middle layer. M (short for \"Middle\" layer) represents turning the layer between the R and L faces 1 quarter turn clockwise (front to back <- you got it reversed), as seen facing the (invisible) L face. S (short for \"Standing\" layer) represents turning the layer between the F and B faces 1 quarter turn clockwise (top to bottom), as seen facing the (visible) F face. E (short for \"Equator\" layer) represents turning the layer between the U and D faces 1 quarter turn clockwise (left to right), as seen facing the (invisible) D face. As with regular turns, a 2 signifies a half turn and a prime (') indicates a turn counterclockwise.\nThe letters M, S and E are lousily defined, as evident from the parentheses with \"visible\" and \"invisible\".\nThe letters H, S and V are used to denote the turning of a middle layer. H (short for \"Horizontal\" layer) represents turning the layer between the U and D faces 1 quarter turn clockwise, as seen facing the (visible) U face. S (short for \"Side\" layer) represents turning the layer between the F and B faces 1 quarter turn clockwise, as seen facing the (visible) F face. V (short for \"Vertical\" layer) represents turning the layer between the R and L faces 1 quarter turn clockwise, as seen facing the (visible) R face. As with regular turns, a prime (') indicates a turn counterclockwise and a 2 signifies a half turn.\n(You removed the old paragraph which said that M, S and E are \"lousily defined\", which made the word \"instead\" in the beginning of the following paragraph with r, f and u look disconnected.  At that time, there was no paragraph about H, S and V.)\nInstead, lowercase letters r, f and u are also used to denote turning layers next to R, F and U respectively in the same direction as R, F and U. This is more consistent with 4-layered cubes.\nIn multiple-layered cubes, numbers may precede face names to indicate rotation of the nth layer from the named face.  2R, 2F and 2U are then used to denote turning layers next to R, F and U respectively in the same direction as R, F and U.

Rubik is involved with several organizations such as Beyond Rubik's Cube, the Rubik Learning Initiative and the Judit Polgar Foundation, all of which aim to engage students in science, mathematics, and problem solving at a young age.\nRubik studied sculpture at the Academy of Applied Arts and Design in Budapest and architecture at the Technical University, also in Budapest. While a professor of design at the academy, he pursued his hobby of building geometric models. One of these was a prototype of his cube, made of 27 wooden blocks; it took Rubik a month to solve the problem of the cube. It proved a useful tool for teaching algebraic group theory, and in late 1977 Konsumex, Hungary's state trading company, began marketing it. By 1980 Rubik's Cube was marketed throughout the world, and over 100 million authorized units, with an estimated 50 million unauthorized imitations, were sold, mostly during its subsequent three years of popularity. Approximately 50 books were published describing how to solve the puzzle of Rubik's Cube. Following his cube's popularity, Rubik opened a studio to develop designs in 1984; among its products was another popular puzzle toy, Rubik's Magic.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nErnő Rubik was born in Budapest, Hungary, on 13 July 1944, during World War II, and has lived all of his life in Hungary. His father, who was also named Ernő Rubik, was a flight engineer at the Esztergom aircraft factory, and his mother, Magdolna Szántó, was a poet. He has stated in almost every interview that he got his inspiration from his father.\nHis father, Ernő, was a highly respected engineer of gliders. His extensive work and expertise in this area gained him an international reputation as an expert in his field. Ernő Rubik has stated that:\n\nBeside him I learned a lot about work in the sense of a value-creating process which has a target, and a positive result too. Both figuratively and literally he was a person capable of 'moving a hill'. There was nothing that could prevent him from doing what he decided or bringing a project to a completion, if necessary even with his own hands. No work was unworthy or undeserving for him.\nFrom 1958 to 1962, Rubik specialized in sculpture at the Secondary School of Fine and Applied Arts. From 1962 to 1967, Rubik attended the Budapest University of Technology where he became a member of the Architecture Faculty. From 1967 to 1971, Rubik attended the Hungarian Academy of Applied Arts and was in the Faculty of Interior Architecture and Design.\nRubik considers university and the education it afforded him as the decisive event which shaped his life. Rubik stated, \"Schools offered me the opportunity to acquire knowledge of subjects or rather crafts that need a lot of practice, persistence, and diligence with the direction of a mentor.\"\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Professorship and origin of the Rubik's Cube ===\nFrom 1971 to 1979, Rubik was a professor of architecture at the Budapest College of Applied Arts (Iparművészeti Főiskola). It was during his time there that he built designs for a three-dimensional puzzle and completed the first working prototype of the Rubik's Cube in 1974, applying for a patent on the puzzle in 1975. In an interview with CNN, Rubik stated that he was \"searching to find a good task for my students.\"\n\nSpace always intrigued me, with its incredibly rich possibilities, space alteration by (architectural) objects, objects' transformation in space (sculpture, design), movement in space and in time, their correlation, their repercussion on mankind, the relation between man and space, the object and time. I think the CUBE arose from \nThe Pocket Cube (also known as the Mini Cube) is a 2×2×2 combination puzzle invented in 1970 by American puzzle designer Larry D. Nichols. The cube consists of 8 pieces, which are all corners.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn February 1970, Larry D. Nichols invented a 2×2×2 \"Puzzle with Pieces Rotatable in Groups\" and filed a Canadian patent application for it. Nichols's cube was held together with magnets. Nichols was granted U.S. patent 3,655,201 on April 11, 1972, two years before Rubik invented his Cube.\nNichols assigned his patent to his employer Moleculon Research Corp., which sued Ideal in 1982. In 1984, Ideal lost the patent infringement suit and appealed. In 1986, the appeals court affirmed the judgment that Rubik's 2×2×2 Pocket Cube infringed Nichols's patent, but overturned the judgment on Rubik's 3×3×3 Cube.\n\n\n== Group Theory ==\nThe group theory of the 3×3×3 cube can be transferred to the 2×2×2 cube. The elements of the group are typically the moves of that can be executed on the cube (both individual rotations of layers and composite moves from several rotations) and the group operator is a concatenation of the moves. \nTo analyse the group of the 2×2×2 cube, the cube configuration has to be determined.

With the 2×2×2 cube, it must also be considered that there is no fixed orientation or top side of the cube,because the 2×2×2 cube has no fixed center pieces.

This relation is reflexive, as two identical moves transform the cube into the same final configuration with the same initial configuration.

The front side of the puzzle shows, in the initial state, three separate, rainbow-colored rings; the back side consists of a scrambled picture of three interconnected rings. The goal of the game is to fold the puzzle into a heart-like shape and unscramble the picture on the back side, thus interconnecting the rings.\nNumerous ways to accomplish this exist, and experienced players can transform the puzzle from its initial into the solved state in less than 2 seconds. Other challenges for Rubik's Magic include reproducing given shapes (which are often three-dimensional), sometimes with certain tiles required to be in certain positions and/or orientations.\n\n\n== History ==\nRubik's Magic was first manufactured by Matchbox in 1986. Professor Rubik holds both a Hungarian patent (HU 1211/85, issued 19 March 1985) and a US patent (US 4,685,680, issued 11 August 1987) on the mechanism of Rubik's Magic. \nIn 1987, Rubik's Magic: Master Edition was published by Matchbox; it consisted of 12 silver tiles arranged in a 2 × 6 rectangle, showing 5 interlinked rings that had to be unlinked by transforming the puzzle into a shape reminiscent of a W. Around the same time, Matchbox also produced Rubik's Magic Create the Cube, a \"Level Two\" version of Rubik's Magic, in which the puzzle is solved when folded into a cube with a base of two tiles, and the tile colors match at the corners of the cube. It did not have as wide a release, and is rare to find.\nIn 1996, the original version of Rubik's Magic was re-released by Oddzon, this time with yellow rings on a red background; other versions (for example, a variant of the original with silver tiles instead of black ones) were also produced, and there also was a strategy game based on Rubik's Magic. An unlicensed 2 × 8 version was also produced, with spheres printed on its tiles instead of rings. Custom versions as large as 2 × 12 have been built using kits available from Oddzon.\n\n\n== Details ==\n\nIt can be seen that the total number of 2 × 4 rectangles that can possibly be created using Rubik's Magic is only thirty-two; these can be created from eight distinct chains. The easiest way to classify chains is by the means of the middle tile of the puzzle's finished form (the only tile that has segments of all three rings) and the tile next to it featuring a yellow/orange ring segment (the indicator tile).\nEvery chain either has the middle tile on the outside (O) or the inside (I) of the chain; if it is arranged so that the indicator tile is to the right of the middle tile, then the position of the ring segment on the indicator tile can either be the upper left (UL), upper right (UR), lower left (LL), or lower right (LR) corner. The position and orientation of the remaining tiles are then determined by the middle and indicator tiles, and eight distinct chains (OUL to ILR) are obtained, although the naming convention is not standardized.\nSimilarly, the 2 × 4 rectangle forms of them can be categorized. Each of these forms has exactly one chain associated with it, and each chain yields four different rectangle forms, depending on the position of the edge where it is folded with regard to the middle tile. By concatenating one of the numbers 0, 1, 2, or 3 to the chain's name, depending on whether the number of tiles to the right of the middle tile before the folding edge, a categorization of the rectangle forms is obtained. The starting position, for example, is rectangle form OUR2.\nThe cube now is \nSpeedcubing, also referred to as speedsolving, is a competitive mind sport centered around the rapid solving of various combination puzzles. The most prominent puzzle in this category is the 3×3×3 puzzle, commonly known as the Rubik's Cube. Participants in this sport are called \"speedcubers\" (or simply \"cubers\"), who focus specifically on solving these puzzles at high speeds to get low clock times. The essential aspect of solving these puzzles typically involves executing a series of predefined algorithms in a particular sequence with eidetic prediction and finger tricks.\nCompetitive speedcubing is predominantly overseen by the World Cube Association (WCA), which officially recognizes 17 distinct speedcubing events. These events encompass a range of puzzles, including N×N×N puzzles of sizes ranging from 2×2×2 to 7×7×7 and other puzzle forms such as the Pyraminx, Megaminx, Skewb, Square-1, and Rubik's Clock. Additionally, specialized formats such as 3×3, 4×4, and 5×5 blindfolded, 3×3 one-handed, 3×3 Fewest Moves Challenge, and 3×3 multi-blind are also regulated and hosted in competitions.\nAs of October 2024, the world record for the fastest single solve of a Rubik's cube in a competitive setting stands at 3.13 seconds. This record was achieved by Max Park at the Pride in Long Beach 2023 event on June 11, 2023. Additionally, Yiheng Wang set the record for the average time of five solves in the 3×3×3 category with 4.09 seconds at Xuzhou Open 2024 on September 21, 2024. Speedcubing participants are predominantly under the age of 20, and numerous countries organize international competitions throughout the year. The widespread popularity of the Rubik's Cube has led to an abundance of online resources, including guides and techniques, aimed at assisting individuals in solving the puzzle.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Rubik's Cube was invented on May 19, 1974, by Hungarian professor of architecture Ernő Rubik (born July 13, 1944). In 1979, Rubik partnered with Ideal Toy Company to garner widespread international interest in the cube. On June 5, 1982, the first world championship of speedcubing was held in Budapest, Hungary. Nineteen people competed in the event, and the American Minh Thai won with a single solve time of 22.95 seconds, which was, at the time, the fastest Rubik's Cube solve ever recorded. Other attendees include Jessica Fridrich and Lars Petrus, both of whom later contributed to the development of new solving methods and of the speedcubing community. The Rubik's Cube waned in popularity after 1983, as there were no official competitions held, but with the advent of the Internet, online websites began to surface to discuss the cube. With these websites facilitating the renewed popularity of the cube, a new generation of speedcubers arose.\nThose prominent in the online speedsolving community, such as Ron van Bruchem, Tyson Mao, Chris Hardwick, and Ton Dennenbroek, eventually wanted to create an organization where cubers from around the world could meet and compete. In 2003, they organized a championship in Toronto, Ontario, followed by another competition in the Netherlands later that same year. This revival of competition sparked a new wave of organized speedcubing events, which included regular national and international competitions. There were twelve competitions in 2004, 58 more from 2005 to 2006, over 100 in 2008, and over 1150 in 2018. Since Budapest's 1982 competition, there have been nine further World Championships traditionally held every other year. This new wave of speedcubing competitions has been and still is organized by the World Cube Association (WCA).\nSince the rise of speedcubing's popularity, numerous entrepreneurial ventures have been founded specializing in making or selling speedcubes, creating competition between these brands and Rubik's. Dozens of cube manufacturers, such as GANCube, MoYu, YJ, and QiYi, have begun improving the cube's technology to allow for smoother turning and faster solving. This has \nA Rubik's Snake (also Rubik's Twist, Rubik's Transformable Snake, Rubik’s Snake Puzzle) is a toy with 24 wedges that are right isosceles triangular prisms. The wedges are connected by spring bolts, so that they can be twisted, but not separated. By being twisted, the Rubik's Snake can be made to resemble a wide variety of objects, animals, or geometric shapes. Its \"ball\" shape in its packaging is a non-uniform concave rhombicuboctahedron.\nThe snake was invented by Ernő Rubik, better known as the inventor of the Rubik's Cube.\nRubik's Snake was released during 1981 at the height of the Rubik's Cube craze. According to Ernő Rubik: \"The snake is not a problem to be solved; it offers infinite possibilities of combination. It is a tool to test out ideas of shape in space. Speaking theoretically, the number of the snake's combinations is limited. But speaking practically, that number is limitless, and a lifetime is not sufficient to realize all of its possibilities.\" Other manufacturers have produced versions with more pieces than the original.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe 24 prisms are aligned in row with an alternating orientation (normal and upside down). Each prism can adopt 4 different positions, each with an offset of 90°. Usually the prisms have alternating colors.\n\n\n== Notation ==\n\n\n=== Twisting instructions ===\nThe steps needed to make an arbitrary shape or figure can be described in a number of ways.\nOne common starting configuration is a straight bar with alternating upper and lower prisms, with the rectangular faces facing up and down, and the triangular faces facing towards the player. The 12 lower prisms are numbered 1 through 12 starting from the left, with the left and the right sloping faces of these prisms are labeled L and R respectively. The last of the upper prisms is on the right, so the L face of prism 1 does not have an adjacent prism.\nThe four possible positions of the adjacent prism on each L and R sloping face are numbered 0, 1, 2 and 3 (representing the number of twists between the bottom prism and the L or R adjacent prism). Numbering is based on always twisting the adjacent prism so it swings towards the player: position 1 turns the adjacent blocks towards them, position 2 makes a 90° turn, and position 3 turns the adjacent block away from the player. Position 0 is the starting position, therefore it is not explicitly noted in step-by-step instructions.\nUsing these rules, a twist can be simply described as:\n\nNumber of the downward-facing prism (from the left): 1 to 12\nLeft or right sloping side of the prism: L or R\nPosition of the twist: 1, 2 or 3\n\n\n=== Machine processing ===\nThe position of the 23 turning areas can also be written directly after each other. Here the positions 0, 1, 2 and 3 are always based on the degrees of twist between the right-hand prisms relative to the left-hand prism, when viewed from the right of the axis of rotation.\nHowever, this notation is impractical for human readers, because it is difficult to determine the order of the twists.\n\n\n=== Fiore method ===\nRather than numbers, Albert Fiore uses letters to refer to the direction the second (rightward) section is turned in relation to the first (leftward) section: D, L, U, and R. These are listed consecutively rather than numbered, so that a completely straight figure rather than being presumed as a starting point is notated DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD.\n\n\n== Mathematical formulation ==\nThe number of different shapes of the Rubik's Snake is at most 423 = 70368744177664 (⁠ ⁠≈⁠ ⁠7×1013 or 70 trillion), i.e. 23 turning areas with 4 positions each. The real number of different shapes is lower, since some configurations are spatially impossible (because they would require multiple prisms to occupy the same region of space). Peter Aylett computed by an exhaustive search that 13446591920995 (≈ 1.3×1013 or 13 Trillion) positions are possible when prohibiting prism collisions, or passing through a collision to reach another position; or 6721828475867\nRubik, the Amazing Cube is a 1983 half-hour Saturday morning animated series based on the puzzle created by Ernő Rubik, produced by Ruby-Spears Enterprises and broadcast as part of The Pac-Man/Rubik, the Amazing Cube Hour block on ABC from September 10 to December 10, 1983 and continued in reruns until September 1, 1984. The Rubik half hour was broadcast in reruns as a standalone series on ABC from May 4 to August 31, 1985.\nThe program features a magic Rubik's Cube named Rubik who can fly through the air and has other special powers. Rubik can only come alive when he is in a solved state. The voice of Rubik, Ron Palillo, told TV Guide in 1983 that for the role, he spoke very slowly and then technicians sped up the tapes and raised the pitch in an Alvin and the Chipmunks–esque manner. Palillo said Rubik's giggle was very different from the trademark laugh of Horshack, his character on the TV series Welcome Back, Kotter, and that it was pretty \"for an inanimate object\". It was also one of the first American animated series to feature a mainly Hispanic and Latino American roster of characters, along with voice actors.\n\n\n== Premise ==\nRubik falls out of the stagecoach of an evil magician, who later becomes the main villain of the series. Rubik helps Carlos, Lisa, and Reynaldo Rodriguez in foiling the magician’s attempts to recover him. \nSome episodes also deal with more normal adversaries, such as when a bully trying to thwart Reynaldo's efforts to impress a girl. \nFor dramatic purposes, Rubik often gets easily fully scrambled, such as by being dropped or grabbed by the family dog. The puzzle is usually solved quickly by the Rodriguez children, although in stressful circumstances it takes them longer. When scrambled, Rubik can only be heard speaking gibberish and can sometimes be heard saying, \"Help.\"\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRon Palillo as Rubik\nMichael Bell as Reynaldo Rodriguez\nJennifer Fajardo as Lisa Rodriguez\nMichael Saucedo as Carlos Rodriguez\nAngela Moya as Marla\nAdditional voices: Jack DeLeon, Alan Dinehart, Laurie Faso, Takayo Fischer, Bob Holt, Tress MacNeille, Tysun McMullan, Neil Ross, John Stephenson, Janet Waldo, Alan Young\n\n\n== Theme song ==\nTying into the human characters being Hispanic Americans, the theme song was sung by Puerto Rican boy band Menudo.

Wiggs and Christopher J. Taylor. The Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ernő Rubik bought the patent from them to market the product under his name.  It was first marketed in 1988.\nThe Rubik's Clock is a two-sided puzzle, each side presenting nine clocks to the puzzler. There are four dials, one at each corner of the puzzle, each allowing the corresponding corner clock to be rotated directly.  (The corner clocks, unlike the other clocks, rotate on both sides of the puzzle simultaneously and can never be operated independently.  Thus the puzzle contains only 14 independent clocks.)\nThere are also four pins which span both sides of the puzzle; each pin arranged such that if it is \"in\" on one side, it is \"out\" on the other. The state of each pin (in or out) determines whether the adjacent corner clock is mechanically connected to the three other adjacent clocks on the front side or on the back side: thus the configuration of the pins determines which sets of clocks can be turned simultaneously by rotating a suitable dial.\nThe aim of the puzzle is to set all nine clocks to 12 o'clock (straight up) on both sides of the puzzle simultaneously. The method to do so is to start by constructing a cross on both sides (at 12 o’clock) and then solving the corner clocks.\nThe Rubik’s clock is listed as one of the 17 WCA events, with records for fastest time to solve one puzzle, and the fastest average time to solve 5 puzzles (discarding the slowest and fastest times).\n\n\n== Combinations ==\nSince there are 14 independent clocks, with 12 settings each, there are a total of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          12\n          \n            14\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 12^{14}}\n  \n=1,283,918,464,548,864 possible combinations for the clock faces.

The most famous of those puzzles is the Rubik's Cube. Since the start of the WCA there have been over 11,700 competitions. The WCA was founded by Ron van Bruchem of the Netherlands and Tyson Mao of the United States in 2004. The goal of the World Cube Association is to have \"more competitions in more countries with more people and more fun, under fair and equal conditions.\" In 2017, they started work to become a non-profit organization and on November 20, 2017, the state of California accepted the initial registration of the World Cube Association.\nThe organization is run by the board members. It assigns different teams and committees as well as delegates who can organize official competitions. The presence of a delegate is required to make the competition official.

Extensions of the Rubik's cube have been around for a long time and come in both hardware and software forms. The major extension have been the availability of cubes of larger size and the availability of the more complex cubes with marked centres. The properties of Rubik’s family cubes of any size together with some special attention to software cubes is the main focus of this article. Many properties are mathematical in nature and are functions of the cube size variable.\n\n\n== Definitions ==\nIn the main, the terminology used here is in agreement with what is in general use. Elsewhere, some terms are used with different meanings. To avoid misconceptions, the meaning of most terms in use in this article is defined below.\n\n\n== Cube types ==\n\n\n=== Hardware cubes ===\nHardware (physical) cubes are based on the original size 3 cube invented by Ernő Rubik in 1974. These cubes usually use coloured stickers on the facelets for cubie identification. The size 3 standard Rubik’s cube gained peak interest in the 1980s and was closely followed by the size 4 (Rubik's Revenge) cube. Other, usually more recently available, hardware forms of the cube come in size 2 (Pocket Cube), size 5 (Professor's Cube), size 6 (V-Cube 6), and size 7 (V-Cube 7). Lesser known hardware cubes of larger sizes have also been produced. Currently, the largest hardware cube made is size 49, and the largest mass-produced is size 21.\n\n\n=== Software cubes ===\nIn parallel with the hardware form of the cube there are many software forms available that obey the same rules as the hardware forms. Software cube emulators are not subject to the physical restraints that impose a size limit on the hardware forms. Hence the only really big cubes available are those in software form. Also, unlike the hardware forms, a range of cube sizes can easily be accommodated by the one program. The design characteristics of programs that allow users to unscramble cubes vary considerably with such features as the capability to allow the user to save a partially unscrambled state being often available.\nSoftware cubes were in use in the 1980s when monochrome monitors were in common use. The lack of colour meant a different way of face identification was required. A program that retained 1980s monochrome capability (using numerals 1 to 6 to identify facelets) for cubes in the size 2 to 11 range was produced in 1991 (together with colour capability in the size 2 to 15 range). More recently developed software cubes use coloured facelets as for hardware cubes.\nThe most common, but by no means universal, approach is to emulate the cube by providing a \"three-dimensional\" display of the cube that makes it look like a real hardware cube. A drawback of the \"three-dimensional\" display is that, without some extra enhancements, the state of parts of the cube for any given view is hidden.\nOther interactive software approaches that do not emulate a three-dimensional cube are also used by some programmers. Generally, an aim of such approaches is to allow the state of all cubies to be in view all the time but has the disadvantage (for some viewers) that the display does not appear like a real-world cube. A conventional two-dimensional (unfolded) display with all cube elements appearing of equal size is one approach. Another form of display where all cube elements do not appear of equal size is also in use. The upper cube size limit for software cubes is limited by the monitor’s available pixels and what viewers find as acceptable which, in turn, is a function of their visual acuity. For cubes of large size it can be advantageous to allow a portion of the cube to be scrolled out of view.\nAll emulators provide a means for the user to change the cube state step-by-step and unscramble the cube. Most emulators use mouse movements to control the rotation of the cube elemen\nThe Simple Solution to Rubik's Cube by James G. Nourse is a book that was published in 1981. The book explains how to solve the Rubik's Cube. The book became the best-selling book of 1981, selling 6,680,000 copies that year. It was the fastest-selling title in the 36-year history of Bantam Books.\n\n\n== Writing ==\nNourse wrote the book at the age of 33 while on the staff of the Chemistry Department at Stanford University. Shortly before Christmas 1980 he bought a Rubik's Cube intending to give it away as a present. Instead he spent the holiday season working out a solution (a \"Layer by Layer\" method), which he published as a 32-page pamphlet for the university bookstore. It reached the hands of a publisher at Bantam who persuaded Nourse to expand the guide into a 64-page book.\n\n\n== Publication ==\nThe book was published June 1981. It became the best-selling book of 1981, selling 6,680,000 copies that year. It was the fastest-selling title in the 36-year history of Bantam Books.\nIn November 1981 Nourse published a sequel, The Simple Solutions to Cubic Puzzles, as an aid to the numerous puzzles that were spawned by the Cube-craze.\n\n\n== Content ==\nThe book begins with a summary of the history of the development of the Rubik's cube by Ernö Rubik and apparently independently by Terutoshi Ishige. The James Nourse method has several features that distinguish it from others: \n\nIt is guaranteed to work\nIt offers clear and steady progress\nIt presents few and uncomplicated decisions\nIt allows for error\nIt features a low number of easy to memorize sequences of moves\nIt is independent of colour\nThe book's solution to the cube was considered to be one of the easiest, simplest, and most straightforward solutions to solving the cube.\n\n\n== Other Methods ==\nMany later solutions to Rubik's Cube published on the internet seem to be based at least in part on the solution in this book. \nThe relatively few sequences one is required to memorize makes it one of the easiest solutions to remember — but this incurs the cost of a relatively high number of moves for a solution — about 100 moves average according to the book on page 54. The author claims he can solve random cube problems by this method in about 2 1/2 minutes (IBID p.54). \nHowever, this ease and simplicity involves a tradeoff in that this solution takes longer than other solutions that are harder and more complex. \n\n\n=== Nomenclature ===\nIn his book, Nourse used an original notation different from that of David Singmaster, which was not yet widely known in 1981. What Nourse called T and B (for Top and Bottom), became popularly known as U and D (for Up and Down). To avoid single-letter ambiguity, the rear face is called Posterior, represented by P (although none of the algorithms presented in the book actually uses the posterior face in its move sequences). \nClockwise and counterclockwise moves are made explicit with + and − (instead of relying on primes to denote counterclockwise, and their absence to denote clockwise).  \nThus, for example, Nourse gives the algorithm for rotating three corners of the bottom face anticlockwise (solving the position Lars Petrus named the \"Sune\") as follows:\n\n R− B− R+ B− R− B2 R+ B2\n\nIn Singmaster's notation, the same move sequence would be written: \n\n R' D' R D' R' D2 R D2\n\n\n== Speed Cubing and Erata ==\nThe book mentions speed cubing on page 56 — citing the following times: \n\n20 minutes - whiz\n10 minutes - speed demon\n5 minutes - expert\n3 minutes - master of cube (M.C.)\nGiven the method requires an average of 100 moves for a solve (IBID p.54), this would be fairly reasonable for the time. However as better methods (i.e. more complex but faster), and better cubes have become available — in 2023 this would have to be revised: \n\n60 seconds - whiz\n40 seconds - speed demon\n15-25 seconds - expert\n3-5 seconds - world champion\nThe better methods allow solves in 50-70 moves, and optimal solutions exist at around 20 moves — this greatly improves the ability to solve a cub\nAn Infinity cube is a kind of mechanical puzzle toy with mathematical principles. Its shape is similar to a 2×2 Rubik's cube. It can be opened and put back together from different directions, thus creating a visually interesting effect.\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\nThe principle of the infinity cube is simple and can be made by hand with simple paper cutting and pasting. First make 8 small cubes, then arrange the small cubes in a 2 by 2 by 2 way, and tape 8 edges together. When combined, there are 28 small squares exposed and 20 small squares hidden inside.\n\n\n== Mathematics ==\nLike the Rubik's Cube, the various states of the Infinity Cube can be represented as a group, but the Infinity Cube has far fewer permutations than the Rubik's Cube.\nRubik's Cube group have \n  \n    \n      \n        43,252,003,274,489,856,000\n        \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              12\n              !\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n        ⋅\n        \n          2\n          \n            12\n            −\n            1\n          \n        \n        ⋅\n        8\n        !\n        ⋅\n        \n          3\n          \n            8\n            −\n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 43{,}252{,}003{,}274{,}489{,}856{,}000\\,\\!={\\frac {12!}{2}}\\cdot 2^{12-1}\\cdot 8!\\cdot 3^{8-1}}\n  \n permutations and isomorphic to the below group, where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A_{n}}\n  \n are alternating groups and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            Z\n          \n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} _{n}}\n  \n are cyclic groups:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          \n            Z\n          \n          \n            3\n          \n          \n            7\n          \n        \n        ×\n        \n          \n            Z\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n          \n            11\n          \n        \n        )\n        ⋊\n        \n        (\n        (\n        \n          A\n          \n            8\n          \n        \n        ×\n        \n          A\n          \n            12\n          \n        \n        )\n        ⋊\n        \n          \n            Z\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (\\mathbb {Z} _{3}^{7}\\times \\mathbb {Z} _{2}^{11})\\rtimes \\,((A_{8}\\times A_{12})\\rtimes \\mathbb {Z} _{2}).}\n  \n\nThe largest group representation for Infinity Cube only contains 6 elements, and can be represented as:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            Z\n          \n          \n            6\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} _{6}}\n  \n\n\n== See also ==\nPaper model\nFidget Cube\n15 puzzle\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMagic Folding Cube - Mathematische-Basteleien\nHow To Make A Paper INFINITY CUBE! on YouTube\nA combination puzzle, also known as a sequential move puzzle, is a puzzle which consists of a set of pieces which can be manipulated into different combinations by a group of operations. Many such puzzles are mechanical puzzles of polyhedral shape, consisting of multiple layers of pieces along each axis which can rotate independently of each other. Collectively known as twisty puzzles, the archetype of this kind of puzzle is the Rubik's Cube. Each rotating side is usually marked with different colours, intended to be scrambled, then solved by a sequence of moves that sort the facets by colour. Generally, combination puzzles also include mathematically defined examples that have not been, or are impossible to, physically construct.\n\n\n== Description ==\nA combination puzzle is solved by achieving a particular combination starting from a random (scrambled) combination. Often, the solution is required to be some recognisable pattern such as \"all like colours together\" or \"all numbers in order\". The most famous of these puzzles is the original Rubik's Cube, a cubic puzzle in which each of the six faces can be independently rotated. Each of the six faces is a different colour, but each of the nine pieces on a face is identical in colour in the solved condition. In the unsolved condition, colours are distributed amongst the pieces of the cube. Puzzles like the Rubik's Cube which are manipulated by rotating a section of pieces are popularly called twisty puzzles. They are often face-turning, but commonly exist in corner-turning and edge-turning varieties.\nThe mechanical construction of the puzzle will usually define the rules by which the combination of pieces can be altered. This leads to some limitations on what combinations are possible. For instance, in the case of the Rubik's Cube, there are a large number of combinations that can be achieved by randomly placing the coloured stickers on the cube, but not all of these can be achieved by manipulating the cube rotations. Similarly, not all the combinations that are mechanically possible from a disassembled cube are possible by manipulation of the puzzle. Since neither unpeeling the stickers nor disassembling the cube is an allowed operation, the possible operations of rotating various faces limit what can be achieved.\nAlthough a mechanical realization of the puzzle is usual, it is not actually necessary. It is only necessary that the rules for the operations are defined. The puzzle can be realized entirely in virtual space or as a set of mathematical statements. In fact, there are some puzzles that can only be realized in virtual space. An example is the 4-dimensional 3×3×3×3 tesseract puzzle, simulated by the MagicCube4D software.\n\n\n== Types ==\nThere have been many different shapes of Rubik type puzzles constructed. As well as cubes, all of the regular polyhedra and many of the semi-regular and stellated polyhedra have been made.\n\n\n=== Regular cuboids ===\nA cuboid is a rectilinear polyhedron. That is, all its edges form right angles. Or in other words (in the majority of cases), a box shape. A regular cuboid, in the context of this article, is a cuboid puzzle where all the pieces are the same size in edge length. Pieces are often referred to as \"cubies\".\n\n\n==== Pattern variations ====\nThere are many puzzles which are mechanically identical to the regular cuboids listed above but have variations in the pattern and colour of design. Some of these are custom made in very small numbers, sometimes for promotional events. The ones listed in the table below are included because the pattern in some way affects the difficulty of the solution or is notable in some other way.\n\n\n===== Sudoku Cube =====\nThe Sudoku Cube or Sudokube is a variation on a Rubik's Cube in which the aim is to solve one or more Sudoku puzzles on the sides or rows. The toy was originally created in 2006 by Jay Horowitz in Sebring, Ohio. It was subsequently produced in China, marketed and sold internationally.\n\n\n====== Pr\nThe Rubik's Revolution is a handheld electronic game invented, designed, developed and patented by Rehco, LLC, a Chicago toy and game inventing firm. The Rubik's Revolution was formerly distributed by Techno Source and received the 2008 TOTY Game of the Year Award. 11-12 years later, it would be revamped by Techno Source's parent company, Super Impulse and be regarded as one of the many toys that would help battle boredom in the Covid-19 Pandemic according to Time To Play Mag  Designed to resemble the classic Rubik's Cube puzzle, the device is a single rigid cube; it is about as large as a Professor's Cube, with each face subdivided into 9 square sub-faces. The center square of each face features a recessed LED-lit button colored to correspond with the stickers on the remaining squares. Gameplay involves pressing the buttons when they light up, or when directed to by the game's recorded voice.\nThis gameplay is completely different from that of the Rubik's Cube, despite the physical resemblance to the Rubik's Cube's solved state. There are no separate, movable sub-cubes as with the Rubik's Cube; the 6 faces are of uniform, unchanging color, and the 9 facets on each face are fixed in place.\n\n\n== Features ==\n\nThe Rubik's Revolution 15 includes 6 electronic games, using the 6 lighted buttons in the recessed squares at the center of each face of the cube and the internal speaker. These games are called \"Light Speed\", \"Rapid Recharge\", \"Pattern Panic\", \"Cube Catcher\", \"Multiplayer Madness\", and \"Code Cracker\". A secret seventh mode is accessible by studying the instruction manual, referred to only as the \"ultimate cube challenge\" by the manual. There is also a Titanium Edition, an Ice Edition, a Micro Edition and the Super \nImpulse 2019 Reboot. The Titanium comes equipped with a memory system that keeps track of scores. The Ice Edition also keeps track of score but also tracks progress. The Micro Edition is a keychain-style cube on which only a shorter version of Light Speed can be played.\nAn electronic voice is used to guide the players both during game play and for configuration, such as\nchanging the volume, which is done by pressing the Yellow & Silver squares when turning on the game. The games also employ various other sound effects, such as a \"ding\" sound when a button is pressed.\n\n\n=== Light Speed (blue) ===\nOne button will light up, and the player has a certain amount of time to press the correct button. As the player makes progress, the player has less time to press the correct button. The game ends if the player presses the wrong button, runs out of time, or beats the game with the maximum score of 999 (20 minutes). The Titanium version of Light Speed allows scores of over 2,384 points (over an hour's worth of game play). The Ice Edition allows scores of over 9,999 points (which is 7,615 more points than the Titanium Edition). The Micro Edition has a maximum score of 99 and, unlike the other editions, has a ranking system for how well a person plays.\n\n\n=== Rapid Recharge (yellow (2007 versions), silver (2019-2020 Super Impulse Version)) ===\nButtons will randomly light up for a short period of time. When a button has been lit for a certain amount of time, it will start flashing and a warning alarm will sound. The player must rapidly press that button to \"recharge\" it. The player wins if they can simultaneously charge every button. The game ends when the player fails to recharge any of the buttons in time, or beats the game. This game was renamed \"Full Charge\" on the 2019-2020 SuperImpulse Edition and adds in a new mechanic, it will also use a timer to tell the player how much time he has to recharge the button before the warning alarm goes off.\n\n\n=== Pattern Panic (green) ===\nA sequence of buttons light up and their colors are spoken, starting with one button on the first round, two on the next, etc. The player has five seconds to correctly press the same sequence of buttons. After a few rounds, the next level is unlocked. \nGod's algorithm is a notion originating in discussions of ways to solve the Rubik's Cube puzzle, but which can also be applied to other combinatorial puzzles and mathematical games. It refers to any algorithm which produces a solution having the fewest possible moves. The allusion to the deity is based on the notion that an omniscient being would know an optimal step from any given configuration.\n\n\n== Scope ==\n\n\n=== Definition ===\nThe notion applies to puzzles that can assume a finite number of \"configurations\", with a relatively small, well-defined arsenal of \"moves\" that may be applicable to configurations and then lead to a new configuration. Solving the puzzle means to reach a designated \"final configuration\", a singular configuration, or one of a collection of configurations. To solve the puzzle a sequence of moves is applied, starting from some arbitrary initial configuration.\n\n\n=== Solution ===\nAn algorithm can be considered to solve such a puzzle if it takes as input an arbitrary initial configuration and produces as output a sequence of moves leading to a final configuration (if the puzzle is solvable from that initial configuration, otherwise it signals the impossibility of a solution). A solution is optimal if the sequence of moves is as short as possible. The highest value of this, among all initial configurations, is known as God's number, or, more formally, the minimax value. God's algorithm, then, for a given puzzle, is an algorithm that solves the puzzle and produces only optimal solutions.\nSome writers, such as David Joyner, consider that for an algorithm to be properly referred to as \"God's algorithm\", it should also be practical, meaning that the algorithm does not require extraordinary amounts of memory or time.  For example, using a giant lookup table indexed by initial configurations would allow solutions to be found very quickly, but would require an extraordinary amount of memory.\nInstead of asking for a full solution, one can equivalently ask for a single move from an initial but not final configuration, where the move is the first of some optimal solution. An algorithm for the single-move version of the problem can be turned into an algorithm for the original problem by invoking it repeatedly while applying each move reported to the present configuration, until a final one is reached; conversely, any algorithm for the original problem can be turned into an algorithm for the single-move version by truncating its output to its first move.\n\n\n== Examples ==\nWell-known puzzles fitting this description are mechanical puzzles such as Rubik's Cube, the Tower of Hanoi, and the 15 puzzle. The one-person game of peg solitaire is also covered, as well as many logic puzzles, such as the missionaries and cannibals problem. These have in common that they can be modeled mathematically as a directed graph, in which the configurations are the vertices, and the moves are the arcs.\n\n\n=== Mechanical puzzles ===\n\n\n==== n-Puzzles ====\nThe Fifteen puzzle can be solved in 80 single-tile moves or 43 multi-tile moves in the worst case. For its generalization the n-puzzle, the problem of finding an optimal solution is NP-hard, so it is not known whether there is a practical God's algorithm.\n\n\n==== Towers of Hanoi ====\nFor the Towers of Hanoi puzzle, a God's algorithm is known for any given number of disks. The number of moves increases exponentially with the number of disks (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          2\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        −\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2^{n}-1}\n  \n).\n\n\n==== Rubik's Cube ====\n\nAn algorithm to determine the minimum number of moves to solve Rubik's Cube was published in 1997 by Richard Korf. While it had been known since 1995 that 20 was a lower bound on the number of moves for the solution in the worst case, Tom Rokicki proved in 2010 that no configuration requires more than 20 moves. Thus, 20 is a sharp upper bound on the length of optimal solutions.

Announced in June 2020, the film was directed by Sue Kim and premiered on July 29, 2020, on Netflix.\n\n\n=== Venue featured ===\nSome of the footage was shot at the World Cube Association's World Championships 2019 held in Melbourne, Australia.\n\n\n== Premise ==\nThe documentary captures the \"extraordinary twists and turns in the journeys of Rubik's Cube-solving champions Max Park and Feliks Zemdegs.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAs per the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 100% of 13 critic reviews are considered positive, with an average rating of 8.2 out of 10 On February 9, 2021, the documentary was shortlisted in the Documentary Short Subject category of the 93rd Academy Awards. At the 5th Critics' Choice Documentary Awards, The Speed Cubers was nominated for Best Short Documentary. The film also received a nomination for the Peabody Award under the documentaries category.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCubers, another documentary about speedcubing\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Speed Cubers at IMDb\nThe Speed Cubers on Netflix \nOfficial trailer\nThe superflip or 12-flip is a special configuration on a Rubik's Cube, in which all the edge and corner pieces are in the correct permutation, and the eight corners are correctly oriented, but all twelve edges are oriented incorrectly (\"flipped\").\nThe term superflip is also used to refer to any algorithm that transforms the Rubik's Cube from its solved state into the superflip configuration.\n\n\n== Properties ==\nThe superflip is a completely symmetrical combination, which means applying a superflip algorithm to the cube will always yield the same position, irrespective of the orientation in which the cube is held.\nThe superflip is self-inverse; i.e. performing a superflip algorithm twice will bring the cube back to the starting position.\nFurthermore, the superflip is the only nontrivial central configuration of the Rubik's Cube. This means that it is commutative with all other algorithms – i.e. performing any algorithm X followed by a superflip algorithm yields exactly the same position as performing the superflip algorithm first followed by X – and it is the only configuration (except trivially for the solved state) with this property. By extension, this implies that a commutator of a superflip and any other algorithm will always bring the cube back to its solved position.\n\n\n== Algorithms ==\nThe table below shows four possible algorithms that transform a solved Rubik's Cube into its superflip configuration, together with the number of moves each algorithm has under each metric:\n\nthe most commonly-used half-turn metric (HTM), in which rotating a face (or outer layer) either 90° or 180° counts as a single move, but a \"slice-turn\" – i.e. rotating a centre layer – counts as two separate moves (equivalent to rotating the two outer layers in the opposite direction);\nthe quarter-turn metric (QTM), in which only 90° face-turns count as single moves; thus, a 180° turn counts as two separate moves, while a slice-turn counts as either two or four moves (depending on whether the slice is moved 90° or 180°);\nthe slice-turn metric (STM), in which 90° face-turns, 180° face-turns, and slice-turns (both 90° and 180° centre-layer rotations) all count as single moves.\nAll the algorithms below are recorded in Singmaster notation:\n\nIt has been shown that the shortest path between a solved cube and the superflip requires 20 moves under HTM (the first algorithm is one such example), and that no position requires more moves. Contrary to popular belief, however, the superflip is not unique in this regard: there are many other positions that also require 20 moves.\nUnder the more restrictive QTM, the superflip requires at least 24 moves (the second algorithm above is one such sequence), and is not maximally distant from the solved state. Instead, when superflip is composed with the \"four-dot\" or \"four-spot\" position, in which four faces have their centres exchanged with the centres on the opposite face, the resulting position requires 26 moves under QTM.\nUnder STM, the superflip requires at least 16 moves (as shown by the third algorithm).\nThe last solution in the table is not optimal under any metric, but is both easiest to learn and fastest to do for humans, as the sequence of moves is very repetitive.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGod's algorithm\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDavid Joyner (2008).

Rubik's 360 was introduced on February 5, 2009 at the Nürnberg International Toy Fair ahead of its worldwide release in August.\nIn contrast to most of Rubik's puzzles, Rubik's 360 is a physical challenge requiring manual dexterity rather than learning and memorizing algorithms. The puzzle involves moving six balls, each a different color, from a central sphere to six color-coded compartments in the outer sphere. This is done by maneuvering them through a middle sphere that only has two holes. There are three spheres that make up the puzzle.\nLike Rubik's Cube, Rubik's 360 has only one solution, but it cannot be solved by being broken apart. It is considered suitable for all ages and reviews described it as addictive and engaging.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBall-in-a-maze puzzle\nPerplexus\nRubik's Revenge\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRubik's official website\nCreator Ernő Rubik introduces the Rubik's 360  Exclusive interview with TIME\nRubik's 360 News and Discussions\nOfficial UK website for the Rubik's 360\nTyson Mao (born May 8, 1984) is an American Rubik's Cube speedsolver. He is a co-founder and a former board member of the World Cube Association, an organization that holds competitive events for the Rubik's Cube.  In 2005, he set the world record for 3x3x3 blindfolded. In 2006, he appeared on the CW Television Network's Beauty and the Geek as one of the participants of the second incarnation of the reality television show.\n\n\n== Personal ==\nTyson Mao was born in San Francisco to immigrant parents from Tainan, Taiwan. He lives in the San Francisco Bay Area and previously used to work as a Poker Product Manager for Zynga. Mao graduated from the California Institute of Technology in 2006 with a degree in astrophysics. His father is a doctor based in South San Francisco.\nIn 2017, Mao opened the Wursthall Restaurant & Bierhaus in San Mateo, California with partners Adam Simpson and J. Kenji López-Alt.\n\n\n== Rubik's Cube ==\nTyson began solving the cube during the Rubik's Cube's second boom in 2003, first using a beginner's method, then the Petrus and Fridrich methods. Tyson is credited for popularizing the \"Caltech move\" for solving the three diagonal corner permutation in blindfold solving.\n\n\n=== Competition Organizer ===\nTyson has been the main organizer of major U.S competitions, including all US Nationals up to 2013, as well as many Caltech competitions.\n\n\n=== Tyson Mao's beginner method ===\nTyson Mao's unofficial beginner method is a set of 8 videos which can be viewed at Rubiks.com. This method is most famous for being used by Will Smith in a past film The Pursuit of Happyness, that was released in 2006. The method is basically a simplified layer-by-layer approach which works much the same way as the Fridrich method. The difference is that the cross is first built around the opposite side to simplify the permutation foresight required, the first two layers are permuted individually, the last layer requires an algorithm to construct a cross, and then repetition of Lars Petrus' Sune algorithm to orient, and finally permutation requires the use of two algorithms, one for the corners and one for the edges. These algorithms may have to be executed multiple times.\n\n\n== Media appearances ==\nBeauty and the Geek Season 2\nCNN's Anderson Cooper 360° (Air date: December 15, 2006)\nIdentity\nThe Tonight Show with Jay Leno (Air date: January 27, 2006)\nTwins\nUSA Network: Show Us Your Character\nGood Morning America (Air date: February 4, 2008)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Brain Trust Behind 'Beauty And The Geek' Says More Stereotype Breaking In Works\".

Since 1988, the arrangement of colours has been standardised, with white opposite yellow, blue opposite green, and orange opposite red, and with the red, white, and blue arranged clockwise, in that order.

The fixed centers have two sections (one visible, one hidden) which can turn independently. This feature is unique to the original design.\nThe Eastsheen version of the puzzle uses a different mechanism. The fixed centers hold the centers next to the central edges in place, which in turn hold the outer edges. The non-central edges hold the corners in place, and the internal sections of the corner pieces do not reach the center of the cube."

There are three mutually perpendicular grooves for the centre pieces to slide through. Each groove is only wide enough to allow one row of centre pieces to slide through it. The ball is shaped to prevent the centre pieces of the other row from sliding, ensuring that the ball remains aligned with the outside of the cube. Turning one of the centre layers moves either just that layer or the ball as well."

The location of these cubes relative to one another can be altered by twisting the layers of the cube, but the location of the coloured sides relative to one another in the completed state of the puzzle cannot be altered: it is fixed by the relative positions of the centre squares and the distribution of colour combinations on edge and corner pieces.

It proved a useful tool for teaching algebraic group theory, and in late 1977 Konsumex, Hungary's state trading company, began marketing it. By 1980 Rubik's Cube was marketed throughout the world, and over 100 million authorized units, with an estimated 50 million unauthorized imitations, were sold, mostly during its subsequent three years of popularity. Approximately 50 books were published describing how to solve the puzzle of Rubik's Cube. Following his cube's popularity, Rubik opened a studio to develop designs in 1984; among its products was another popular puzzle toy, Rubik's Magic."

Around the same time, Matchbox also produced Rubik's Magic Create the Cube, a \"Level Two\" version of Rubik's Magic, in which the puzzle is solved when folded into a cube with a base of two tiles, and the tile colors match at the corners of the cube.

Collectively known as twisty puzzles, the archetype of this kind of puzzle is the Rubik's Cube. Each rotating side is usually marked with different colours, intended to be scrambled, then solved by a sequence of moves that sort the facets by colour.

Often, the solution is required to be some recognisable pattern such as \"all like colours together\" or \"all numbers in order\". The most famous of these puzzles is the original Rubik's Cube, a cubic puzzle in which each of the six faces can be independently rotated. Each of the six faces is a different colour, but each of the nine pieces on a face is identical in colour in the solved condition. In the unsolved condition, colours are distributed amongst the pieces of the cube. Puzzles like the Rubik's Cube which are manipulated by rotating a section of pieces are popularly called twisty puzzles. They are often face-turning, but commonly exist in corner-turning and edge-turning varieties."

Similarly, not all the combinations that are mechanically possible from a disassembled cube are possible by manipulation of the puzzle.

That is, all its edges form right angles. Or in other words (in the majority of cases), a box shape. A regular cuboid, in the context of this article, is a cuboid puzzle where all the pieces are the same size in edge length.

A solution is optimal if the sequence of moves is as short as possible. The highest value of this, among all initial configurations, is known as God's number, or, more formally, the minimax value.

An algorithm for the single-move version of the problem can be turned into an algorithm for the original problem by invoking it repeatedly while applying each move reported to the present configuration, until a final one is reached; conversely, any algorithm for the original problem can be turned into an algorithm for the single-move version by truncating its output to its first move."

Instead, when superflip is composed with the \"four-dot\" or \"four-spot\" position, in which four faces have their centres exchanged with the centres on the opposite face, the resulting position requires 26 moves under QTM.\nUnder STM, the superflip requires at least 16 moves (as shown by the third algorithm).\nThe last solution in the table is not optimal under any metric, but is both easiest to learn and fastest to do for humans, as the sequence of moves is very repetitive."

Rubik's 360 was introduced on February 5, 2009 at the Nürnberg International Toy Fair ahead of its worldwide release in August.\nIn contrast to most of Rubik's puzzles, Rubik's 360 is a physical challenge requiring manual dexterity rather than learning and memorizing algorithms. The puzzle involves moving six balls, each a different color, from a central sphere to six color-coded compartments in the outer sphere. This is done by maneuvering them through a middle sphere that only has two holes. There are three spheres that make up the puzzle."

This method is most famous for being used by Will Smith in a past film The Pursuit of Happyness, that was released in 2006. The method is basically a simplified layer-by-layer approach which works much the same way as the Fridrich method. The difference is that the cross is first built around the opposite side to simplify the permutation foresight required, the first two layers are permuted individually, the last layer requires an algorithm to construct a cross, and then repetition of Lars Petrus' Sune algorithm to orient, and finally permutation requires the use of two algorithms, one for the corners and one for the edges. These algorithms may have to be executed multiple times."
