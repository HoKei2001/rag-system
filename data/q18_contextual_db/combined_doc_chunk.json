        "content": "The Rubik's Cube is a 3D combination puzzle invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ernő Rubik. Originally called the Magic Cube, the puzzle was licensed by Rubik to be sold by Pentangle Puzzles in the UK in 1978, and then by Ideal Toy Corp in 1980 via businessman Tibor Laczi and Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer. The cube was released internationally in 1980 and became one of the most recognized icons in popular culture. It won the 1980 German Game of the Year special award for Best Puzzle. As of January 2024, around 500 million cubes had been sold worldwide, making it the world's bestselling puzzle game and bestselling toy. The Rubik's Cube was inducted into the US National Toy Hall of Fame in 2014.\nOn the original, classic Rubik's Cube, each of the six faces was covered by nine stickers, with each face in one of six solid colours: white, red, blue, orange, green, and yellow. Some later versions of the cube have been updated to use coloured plastic panels instead. Since 1988, the arrangement of colours has been standardised, with white opposite yellow, blue opposite green, and orange opposite red, and with the red, white, and blue arranged clockwise, in that order. On early cubes, the position of the colours varied from cube to cube.\n\nAn internal pivot mechanism enables each face to turn independently, thus mixing up the colours. For the puzzle to be solved, each face must be returned to having only one colour. The Cube has inspired other designers to create a number of similar puzzles with various numbers of sides, dimensions, and mechanisms.\nAlthough the Rubik's Cube reached the height of its mainstream popularity in the 1980s, it is still widely known and used. Many speedcubers continue to practice it and similar puzzles, and to compete for the fastest times in various categories. Since 2003, the World Cube Association (WCA), the international governing body of the Rubik's Cube, has organised competitions worldwide and has recognised world records.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Precursors ===\n\nIn March 1970, Larry D. Nichols invented a 2x2x2 \"Puzzle with Pieces Rotatable in Groups\" and filed a Canadian patent application for it. Nichols's cube was held together by magnets. Nichols was granted U.S. patent 3,655,201 on 11 April 1972, two years before Rubik invented his Cube.\nOn 9 April 1970, Frank Fox applied to patent an \"amusement device\", a type of sliding puzzle on a spherical surface with \"at least two 3×3 arrays\" intended to be used for the game of noughts and crosses. He received his UK patent (1344259) on 16 January 1974.\n\n\n=== Rubik's invention ===\nIn the mid-1970s, Ernő Rubik worked at the Department of Interior Design at the Academy of Applied Arts and Crafts in Budapest. Although it is widely reported that the Cube was built as a teaching tool to help his students understand 3D objects, his actual purpose was solving the structural problem of moving the parts independently without the entire mechanism falling apart.  He did not realise that he had created a puzzle until the first time he scrambled his new Cube and then tried to restore it. Rubik applied for a patent in Hungary for his \"Magic Cube\" (Hungarian: bűvös kocka) on 30 January 1975, and HU170062 was granted later that year.\n\nThe first test batches of the Magic Cube were produced in late 1977 and released in toy shops in Budapest. Magic Cube was held together with interlocking plastic pieces that prevented the puzzle from being easily pulled apart, unlike the magnets in Nichols's design. With Ernő Rubik's permission, businessman Tibor Laczi took a Cube to Germany's Nuremberg Toy Fair in February 1979 in an attempt to popularise it. It was noticed by Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer, and they signed a deal with Ideal Toys in September 1979 to release the Magic Cube worldwide. Ideal wanted at least a recognisable name to trademark; that arrangement put Rubik in the spotlight because the Magic Cube was renamed after its inventor in 1980. The\nThe Rubik's Cube group \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        G\n        ,\n        ⋅\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (G,\\cdot )}\n  \n  represents the structure of the Rubik's Cube mechanical puzzle. Each element of the set \n  \n    \n      \n        G\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle G}\n  \n corresponds to a cube move, which is the effect of any sequence of rotations of the cube's faces. With this representation, not only can any cube move be represented, but any position of the cube as well, by detailing the cube moves required to rotate the solved cube into that position. Indeed with the solved position as a starting point, there is a one-to-one correspondence between each of the legal positions of the Rubik's Cube and the elements of \n  \n    \n      \n        G\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle G}\n  \n. The group operation \n  \n    \n      \n        ⋅\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\cdot }\n  \n is the composition of cube moves, corresponding to the result of performing one cube move after another.   \nThe Rubik's Cube is constructed by labeling each of the 48 non-center facets with the integers 1 to 48. Each configuration of the cube can be represented as a permutation of the labels 1 to 48, depending on the position of each facet. Using this representation, the solved cube is the identity permutation which leaves the cube unchanged, while the twelve cube moves that rotate a layer of the cube 90 degrees are represented by their respective permutations. The Rubik's Cube group is the subgroup of the symmetric group \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          S\n          \n            48\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle S_{48}}\n  \n generated by the six permutations corresponding to the six clockwise cube moves. With this construction, any configuration of the cube reachable through a sequence of cube moves is within the group. Its operation \n  \n    \n      \n        ⋅\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\cdot }\n  \n refers to the composition of two permutations; within the cube, this refers to combining two sequences of cube moves together, doing one after the other. The Rubik's Cube group is non-abelian as composition of cube moves is not commutative; doing two sequences of cube moves in a different order can result in a different configuration.\n\n\n== Cube moves ==\nA \n  \n    \n      \n        3\n        ×\n        3\n        ×\n        3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 3\\times 3\\times 3}\n  \n Rubik's Cube consists of \n  \n    \n      \n        6\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 6}\n  \n faces, each with \n  \n    \n      \n        9\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 9}\n  \n colored squares called facelets, for a total of \n  \n    \n      \n        54\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 54}\n  \n facelets.

It has qualities in common with both the 3×3×3 Rubik's Cube and the 4×4×4 Rubik's Revenge, and solution strategies for both can be applied.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Professor's Cube was invented by Udo Krell in 1981. Out of the many designs that were proposed, Udo Krell's design was the first 5×5×5 design that was manufactured and sold. Uwe Mèffert manufactured the cube and sold it in Hong Kong in 1983.\nIdeal Toys, who first popularized the original 3x3x3 Rubik's cube, marketed the puzzle in Germany as the \"Rubik's Wahn\" (German: Rubik's Craze). When the cube was marketed in Japan, it was marketed under the name \"Professor's Cube\". Mèffert reissued the cube under the name \"Professor's Cube\" in the 1990s.\nThe early versions of the 5×5×5 cube sold at Barnes & Noble were marketed under the name \"Professor's Cube\" but currently, Barnes and Noble sells cubes that are simply called \"5×5 Cube.\" Mefferts.com used to sell a limited edition version of the 5×5×5 cube called the Professor's Cube. This version had colored tiles rather than stickers. Verdes Innovations sells a version called the V-Cube 5.\n\n\n== Workings ==\n\nThe original Professor's Cube design by Udo Krell works by using an expanded 3×3×3 cube as a mantle with the center edge pieces and corners sticking out from the spherical center of identical mechanism to the 3×3×3 cube. All non-central pieces have extensions that fit into slots on the outer pieces of the 3×3×3, which keeps them from falling out of the cube while making a turn. The fixed centers have two sections (one visible, one hidden) which can turn independently. This feature is unique to the original design.\nThe Eastsheen version of the puzzle uses a different mechanism. The fixed centers hold the centers next to the central edges in place, which in turn hold the outer edges. The non-central edges hold the corners in place, and the internal sections of the corner pieces do not reach the center of the cube.\nThe V-Cube 5 mechanism, designed by Panagiotis Verdes, has elements in common with both. The corners reach to the center of the puzzle (like the original mechanism) and the center pieces hold the central edges in place (like the Eastsheen mechanism). The middle edges and center pieces adjacent to them make up the supporting frame and these have extensions which hold the rest of the pieces together. This allows smooth and fast rotation and created what was arguably the fastest and most durable version of the puzzle available at that time. Unlike the original 5×5×5 design, the V-Cube 5 mechanism was designed to allow speedcubing. Most current production 5×5×5 speed cubes have mechanisms based on Verdes' patent.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Stability and durability ==\n\nThe original Professor's Cube is inherently more delicate than the 3×3×3 Rubik's Cube because of the much greater number of moving parts and pieces. Because of its fragile design, the Rubik's brand Professor's Cube is not suitable for Speedcubing. Applying excessive force to the cube when twisting it may result in broken pieces.  Both the Eastsheen 5×5×5 and the V-Cube 5 are designed with different mechanisms in an attempt to remedy the fragility of the original design.\n\n\n== Permutations ==\nThere are 98 pieces on the exterior of the cube: 8 corners, 36 edges, and 54 centers (48 movable, 6 fixed).\nAny permutation of the corners is possible, including odd permutations, giving 8! possible arrangements. Seven of the corners can be independently rotated, and the orientation of the eighth corner depends on the other seven, giving 37 (or 2,187) combinations.\nThere are 54 centers. Six of these (the center square of each face) are fixed in position. The rest consist of two sets of 24 centers. Within each set there are four centers of each color. Each set can be arranged in 24! different ways.\nThe Rubik's Revenge (also known as the 4×4×4 Rubik's Cube) is a 4×4×4 version of the Rubik's Cube. It was released in 1981. Invented by Péter Sebestény, the cube was nearly called the Sebestény Cube until a somewhat last-minute decision changed the puzzle's name to attract fans of the original Rubik's Cube. Unlike the original puzzle (and other puzzles with an odd number of layers like the 5×5×5 cube), it has no fixed faces: the center faces (four per face) are free to move to different positions.\nMethods for solving the 3×3×3 cube work for the edges and corners of the 4×4×4 cube, as long as one has correctly identified the relative positions of the colours—since the center faces can no longer be used for identification.\n\n\n== Mechanics ==\n\nThe puzzle consists of 56 unique miniature cubes (\"cubies\") on the surface. These consist of 24 centres which show one colour each, 24 edges which show two colours each, and 8 corners which show three colours each. The original Rubik's Revenge can be taken apart without much difficulty, typically by turning one side through a 30° angle and prying an edge upward until it dislodges.\nThe original mechanism designed by Sebestény uses a grooved ball to hold the centre pieces in place. The edge pieces are held in place by the centres and the corners are held in place by the edges, much like the original cube. There are three mutually perpendicular grooves for the centre pieces to slide through. Each groove is only wide enough to allow one row of centre pieces to slide through it. The ball is shaped to prevent the centre pieces of the other row from sliding, ensuring that the ball remains aligned with the outside of the cube. Turning one of the centre layers moves either just that layer or the ball as well.\nThe Eastsheen version of the cube, which is slightly smaller at 6cm to an edge, has a completely different mechanism. Its mechanism is very similar to Eastsheen's version of the Professor's cube, instead of the ball-core mechanism. There are 42 pieces (36 movable and six fixed) completely hidden within the cube, corresponding to the centre rows on the Professor's Cube. This design is more durable than the original and also allows for screws to be used to tighten or loosen the cube. The central spindle is specially shaped to prevent it from becoming misaligned with the exterior of the cube. Nearly all manufacturers of 4×4×4 use similar mechanisms.\nThere are 24 edge pieces which show two coloured sides each, and eight corner pieces which show three colours. Each corner piece or pair of edge pieces shows a unique colour combination, but not all combinations are present (for example, there is no piece with both red and orange sides, if red and orange are on opposite sides of the solved Cube). The location of these cubes relative to one another can be altered by twisting the layers of the cube, but the location of the coloured sides relative to one another in the completed state of the puzzle cannot be altered: it is fixed by the relative positions of the centre squares and the distribution of colour combinations on edge and corner pieces. Edge pairs are often referred to as \"dedges,\" from double edges.\nFor most recent cubes, the colours of the stickers are red opposite orange, yellow opposite white, and green opposite blue. However, there also exist cubes with alternative colour arrangements (yellow opposite green, blue opposite white and red opposite orange).  The Eastsheen version has purple (opposite red) instead of orange.\n\n\n=== Permutations ===\n\nThere are 8 corners, 24 edges and 24 centres.\nAny permutation of the corners is possible, including odd permutations. Seven of the corners can be independently rotated, and the orientation of the eighth depends on the other seven, giving 8!×37 combinations.\nThere are 24 centres, which can be arranged in 24! different ways. Assuming that the four centres of each colour are indistinguishable, the number of permutations is reduced to 24!/(246) arrangements\nOptimal solutions for the Rubik's Cube are solutions that are the shortest in some sense. There are two common ways to measure the length of a solution.  The first is to count the number of quarter turns. The second is to count the number of outer-layer twists, called \"face turns\". A move to turn an outer layer two quarter (90°) turns in the same direction would be counted as two moves in the quarter turn metric (QTM), but as one turn in the face metric (FTM, or HTM \"Half Turn Metric\", or OBTM \"Outer Block Turn Metric\").\nThe maximal number of face turns needed to solve any instance of the Rubik's Cube is 20, and the maximal number of quarter turns is 26. These numbers are also the diameters of the corresponding  Cayley graphs of the Rubik's Cube group. In STM (slice turn metric), the minimal number of turns is unknown.\nThere are many algorithms to solve scrambled Rubik's Cubes. An algorithm that solves a cube in the minimum number of moves is known as God's algorithm.\n\n\n== Move notation ==\n\nTo denote a sequence of moves on the 3×3×3 Rubik's Cube, this article uses \"Singmaster notation\", which was developed by David Singmaster.\nThe following are standard moves, which do not move centre cubies of any face to another location:\nThe letters L, R, F, B, U, and D indicate a clockwise quarter turn of the left, right, front, back, up, and down face respectively. A half turn (i.e. 2 quarter turns in the same direction) are indicated by appending a 2. A counterclockwise turn is indicated by appending a prime symbol ( ′ ).\nHowever, because these notations are human-oriented, we use clockwise as positive, and not mathematically oriented, which is counterclockwise as positive.\nThe following are non-standard moves\nNon-standard moves are usually represented with lowercase letters in contrast to the standard moves above.\nMoving centre cubies of faces to other locations:\nThe letters M, S and E are used to denote the turning of a middle layer. M (short for \"Middle\" layer) represents turning the layer between the R and L faces 1 quarter turn clockwise (front to back <- you got it reversed), as seen facing the (invisible) L face. S (short for \"Standing\" layer) represents turning the layer between the F and B faces 1 quarter turn clockwise (top to bottom), as seen facing the (visible) F face. E (short for \"Equator\" layer) represents turning the layer between the U and D faces 1 quarter turn clockwise (left to right), as seen facing the (invisible) D face. As with regular turns, a 2 signifies a half turn and a prime (') indicates a turn counterclockwise.\nThe letters M, S and E are lousily defined, as evident from the parentheses with \"visible\" and \"invisible\".\nThe letters H, S and V are used to denote the turning of a middle layer. H (short for \"Horizontal\" layer) represents turning the layer between the U and D faces 1 quarter turn clockwise, as seen facing the (visible) U face. S (short for \"Side\" layer) represents turning the layer between the F and B faces 1 quarter turn clockwise, as seen facing the (visible) F face. V (short for \"Vertical\" layer) represents turning the layer between the R and L faces 1 quarter turn clockwise, as seen facing the (visible) R face. As with regular turns, a prime (') indicates a turn counterclockwise and a 2 signifies a half turn.\n(You removed the old paragraph which said that M, S and E are \"lousily defined\", which made the word \"instead\" in the beginning of the following paragraph with r, f and u look disconnected.  At that time, there was no paragraph about H, S and V.)\nInstead, lowercase letters r, f and u are also used to denote turning layers next to R, F and U respectively in the same direction as R, F and U. This is more consistent with 4-layered cubes.\nIn multiple-layered cubes, numbers may precede face names to indicate rotation of the nth layer from the named face.  2R, 2F and 2U are then used to denote turning layers next to R, F and U respectively in the same direction as R, F and U.

Rubik is involved with several organizations such as Beyond Rubik's Cube, the Rubik Learning Initiative and the Judit Polgar Foundation, all of which aim to engage students in science, mathematics, and problem solving at a young age.\nRubik studied sculpture at the Academy of Applied Arts and Design in Budapest and architecture at the Technical University, also in Budapest. While a professor of design at the academy, he pursued his hobby of building geometric models. One of these was a prototype of his cube, made of 27 wooden blocks; it took Rubik a month to solve the problem of the cube. It proved a useful tool for teaching algebraic group theory, and in late 1977 Konsumex, Hungary's state trading company, began marketing it. By 1980 Rubik's Cube was marketed throughout the world, and over 100 million authorized units, with an estimated 50 million unauthorized imitations, were sold, mostly during its subsequent three years of popularity. Approximately 50 books were published describing how to solve the puzzle of Rubik's Cube. Following his cube's popularity, Rubik opened a studio to develop designs in 1984; among its products was another popular puzzle toy, Rubik's Magic.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nErnő Rubik was born in Budapest, Hungary, on 13 July 1944, during World War II, and has lived all of his life in Hungary. His father, who was also named Ernő Rubik, was a flight engineer at the Esztergom aircraft factory, and his mother, Magdolna Szántó, was a poet. He has stated in almost every interview that he got his inspiration from his father.\nHis father, Ernő, was a highly respected engineer of gliders. His extensive work and expertise in this area gained him an international reputation as an expert in his field. Ernő Rubik has stated that:\n\nBeside him I learned a lot about work in the sense of a value-creating process which has a target, and a positive result too. Both figuratively and literally he was a person capable of 'moving a hill'. There was nothing that could prevent him from doing what he decided or bringing a project to a completion, if necessary even with his own hands. No work was unworthy or undeserving for him.\nFrom 1958 to 1962, Rubik specialized in sculpture at the Secondary School of Fine and Applied Arts. From 1962 to 1967, Rubik attended the Budapest University of Technology where he became a member of the Architecture Faculty. From 1967 to 1971, Rubik attended the Hungarian Academy of Applied Arts and was in the Faculty of Interior Architecture and Design.\nRubik considers university and the education it afforded him as the decisive event which shaped his life. Rubik stated, \"Schools offered me the opportunity to acquire knowledge of subjects or rather crafts that need a lot of practice, persistence, and diligence with the direction of a mentor.\"\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Professorship and origin of the Rubik's Cube ===\nFrom 1971 to 1979, Rubik was a professor of architecture at the Budapest College of Applied Arts (Iparművészeti Főiskola). It was during his time there that he built designs for a three-dimensional puzzle and completed the first working prototype of the Rubik's Cube in 1974, applying for a patent on the puzzle in 1975. In an interview with CNN, Rubik stated that he was \"searching to find a good task for my students.\"\n\nSpace always intrigued me, with its incredibly rich possibilities, space alteration by (architectural) objects, objects' transformation in space (sculpture, design), movement in space and in time, their correlation, their repercussion on mankind, the relation between man and space, the object and time. I think the CUBE arose from \nThe Pocket Cube (also known as the Mini Cube) is a 2×2×2 combination puzzle invented in 1970 by American puzzle designer Larry D. Nichols. The cube consists of 8 pieces, which are all corners.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn February 1970, Larry D. Nichols invented a 2×2×2 \"Puzzle with Pieces Rotatable in Groups\" and filed a Canadian patent application for it. Nichols's cube was held together with magnets. Nichols was granted U.S. patent 3,655,201 on April 11, 1972, two years before Rubik invented his Cube.\nNichols assigned his patent to his employer Moleculon Research Corp., which sued Ideal in 1982. In 1984, Ideal lost the patent infringement suit and appealed. In 1986, the appeals court affirmed the judgment that Rubik's 2×2×2 Pocket Cube infringed Nichols's patent, but overturned the judgment on Rubik's 3×3×3 Cube.\n\n\n== Group Theory ==\nThe group theory of the 3×3×3 cube can be transferred to the 2×2×2 cube. The elements of the group are typically the moves of that can be executed on the cube (both individual rotations of layers and composite moves from several rotations) and the group operator is a concatenation of the moves. \nTo analyse the group of the 2×2×2 cube, the cube configuration has to be determined.

With the 2×2×2 cube, it must also be considered that there is no fixed orientation or top side of the cube,because the 2×2×2 cube has no fixed center pieces.

This relation is reflexive, as two identical moves transform the cube into the same final configuration with the same initial configuration.

The front side of the puzzle shows, in the initial state, three separate, rainbow-colored rings; the back side consists of a scrambled picture of three interconnected rings. The goal of the game is to fold the puzzle into a heart-like shape and unscramble the picture on the back side, thus interconnecting the rings.\nNumerous ways to accomplish this exist, and experienced players can transform the puzzle from its initial into the solved state in less than 2 seconds. Other challenges for Rubik's Magic include reproducing given shapes (which are often three-dimensional), sometimes with certain tiles required to be in certain positions and/or orientations.\n\n\n== History ==\nRubik's Magic was first manufactured by Matchbox in 1986. Professor Rubik holds both a Hungarian patent (HU 1211/85, issued 19 March 1985) and a US patent (US 4,685,680, issued 11 August 1987) on the mechanism of Rubik's Magic. \nIn 1987, Rubik's Magic: Master Edition was published by Matchbox; it consisted of 12 silver tiles arranged in a 2 × 6 rectangle, showing 5 interlinked rings that had to be unlinked by transforming the puzzle into a shape reminiscent of a W. Around the same time, Matchbox also produced Rubik's Magic Create the Cube, a \"Level Two\" version of Rubik's Magic, in which the puzzle is solved when folded into a cube with a base of two tiles, and the tile colors match at the corners of the cube. It did not have as wide a release, and is rare to find.\nIn 1996, the original version of Rubik's Magic was re-released by Oddzon, this time with yellow rings on a red background; other versions (for example, a variant of the original with silver tiles instead of black ones) were also produced, and there also was a strategy game based on Rubik's Magic. An unlicensed 2 × 8 version was also produced, with spheres printed on its tiles instead of rings. Custom versions as large as 2 × 12 have been built using kits available from Oddzon.\n\n\n== Details ==\n\nIt can be seen that the total number of 2 × 4 rectangles that can possibly be created using Rubik's Magic is only thirty-two; these can be created from eight distinct chains. The easiest way to classify chains is by the means of the middle tile of the puzzle's finished form (the only tile that has segments of all three rings) and the tile next to it featuring a yellow/orange ring segment (the indicator tile).\nEvery chain either has the middle tile on the outside (O) or the inside (I) of the chain; if it is arranged so that the indicator tile is to the right of the middle tile, then the position of the ring segment on the indicator tile can either be the upper left (UL), upper right (UR), lower left (LL), or lower right (LR) corner. The position and orientation of the remaining tiles are then determined by the middle and indicator tiles, and eight distinct chains (OUL to ILR) are obtained, although the naming convention is not standardized.\nSimilarly, the 2 × 4 rectangle forms of them can be categorized. Each of these forms has exactly one chain associated with it, and each chain yields four different rectangle forms, depending on the position of the edge where it is folded with regard to the middle tile. By concatenating one of the numbers 0, 1, 2, or 3 to the chain's name, depending on whether the number of tiles to the right of the middle tile before the folding edge, a categorization of the rectangle forms is obtained. The starting position, for example, is rectangle form OUR2.\nThe cube now is \nSpeedcubing, also referred to as speedsolving, is a competitive mind sport centered around the rapid solving of various combination puzzles. The most prominent puzzle in this category is the 3×3×3 puzzle, commonly known as the Rubik's Cube. Participants in this sport are called \"speedcubers\" (or simply \"cubers\"), who focus specifically on solving these puzzles at high speeds to get low clock times. The essential aspect of solving these puzzles typically involves executing a series of predefined algorithms in a particular sequence with eidetic prediction and finger tricks.\nCompetitive speedcubing is predominantly overseen by the World Cube Association (WCA), which officially recognizes 17 distinct speedcubing events. These events encompass a range of puzzles, including N×N×N puzzles of sizes ranging from 2×2×2 to 7×7×7 and other puzzle forms such as the Pyraminx, Megaminx, Skewb, Square-1, and Rubik's Clock. Additionally, specialized formats such as 3×3, 4×4, and 5×5 blindfolded, 3×3 one-handed, 3×3 Fewest Moves Challenge, and 3×3 multi-blind are also regulated and hosted in competitions.\nAs of October 2024, the world record for the fastest single solve of a Rubik's cube in a competitive setting stands at 3.13 seconds. This record was achieved by Max Park at the Pride in Long Beach 2023 event on June 11, 2023. Additionally, Yiheng Wang set the record for the average time of five solves in the 3×3×3 category with 4.09 seconds at Xuzhou Open 2024 on September 21, 2024. Speedcubing participants are predominantly under the age of 20, and numerous countries organize international competitions throughout the year. The widespread popularity of the Rubik's Cube has led to an abundance of online resources, including guides and techniques, aimed at assisting individuals in solving the puzzle.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Rubik's Cube was invented on May 19, 1974, by Hungarian professor of architecture Ernő Rubik (born July 13, 1944). In 1979, Rubik partnered with Ideal Toy Company to garner widespread international interest in the cube. On June 5, 1982, the first world championship of speedcubing was held in Budapest, Hungary. Nineteen people competed in the event, and the American Minh Thai won with a single solve time of 22.95 seconds, which was, at the time, the fastest Rubik's Cube solve ever recorded. Other attendees include Jessica Fridrich and Lars Petrus, both of whom later contributed to the development of new solving methods and of the speedcubing community. The Rubik's Cube waned in popularity after 1983, as there were no official competitions held, but with the advent of the Internet, online websites began to surface to discuss the cube. With these websites facilitating the renewed popularity of the cube, a new generation of speedcubers arose.\nThose prominent in the online speedsolving community, such as Ron van Bruchem, Tyson Mao, Chris Hardwick, and Ton Dennenbroek, eventually wanted to create an organization where cubers from around the world could meet and compete. In 2003, they organized a championship in Toronto, Ontario, followed by another competition in the Netherlands later that same year. This revival of competition sparked a new wave of organized speedcubing events, which included regular national and international competitions. There were twelve competitions in 2004, 58 more from 2005 to 2006, over 100 in 2008, and over 1150 in 2018. Since Budapest's 1982 competition, there have been nine further World Championships traditionally held every other year. This new wave of speedcubing competitions has been and still is organized by the World Cube Association (WCA).\nSince the rise of speedcubing's popularity, numerous entrepreneurial ventures have been founded specializing in making or selling speedcubes, creating competition between these brands and Rubik's. Dozens of cube manufacturers, such as GANCube, MoYu, YJ, and QiYi, have begun improving the cube's technology to allow for smoother turning and faster solving. This has \nA Rubik's Snake (also Rubik's Twist, Rubik's Transformable Snake, Rubik’s Snake Puzzle) is a toy with 24 wedges that are right isosceles triangular prisms. The wedges are connected by spring bolts, so that they can be twisted, but not separated. By being twisted, the Rubik's Snake can be made to resemble a wide variety of objects, animals, or geometric shapes. Its \"ball\" shape in its packaging is a non-uniform concave rhombicuboctahedron.\nThe snake was invented by Ernő Rubik, better known as the inventor of the Rubik's Cube.\nRubik's Snake was released during 1981 at the height of the Rubik's Cube craze. According to Ernő Rubik: \"The snake is not a problem to be solved; it offers infinite possibilities of combination. It is a tool to test out ideas of shape in space. Speaking theoretically, the number of the snake's combinations is limited. But speaking practically, that number is limitless, and a lifetime is not sufficient to realize all of its possibilities.\" Other manufacturers have produced versions with more pieces than the original.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe 24 prisms are aligned in row with an alternating orientation (normal and upside down). Each prism can adopt 4 different positions, each with an offset of 90°. Usually the prisms have alternating colors.\n\n\n== Notation ==\n\n\n=== Twisting instructions ===\nThe steps needed to make an arbitrary shape or figure can be described in a number of ways.\nOne common starting configuration is a straight bar with alternating upper and lower prisms, with the rectangular faces facing up and down, and the triangular faces facing towards the player. The 12 lower prisms are numbered 1 through 12 starting from the left, with the left and the right sloping faces of these prisms are labeled L and R respectively. The last of the upper prisms is on the right, so the L face of prism 1 does not have an adjacent prism.\nThe four possible positions of the adjacent prism on each L and R sloping face are numbered 0, 1, 2 and 3 (representing the number of twists between the bottom prism and the L or R adjacent prism). Numbering is based on always twisting the adjacent prism so it swings towards the player: position 1 turns the adjacent blocks towards them, position 2 makes a 90° turn, and position 3 turns the adjacent block away from the player. Position 0 is the starting position, therefore it is not explicitly noted in step-by-step instructions.\nUsing these rules, a twist can be simply described as:\n\nNumber of the downward-facing prism (from the left): 1 to 12\nLeft or right sloping side of the prism: L or R\nPosition of the twist: 1, 2 or 3\n\n\n=== Machine processing ===\nThe position of the 23 turning areas can also be written directly after each other. Here the positions 0, 1, 2 and 3 are always based on the degrees of twist between the right-hand prisms relative to the left-hand prism, when viewed from the right of the axis of rotation.\nHowever, this notation is impractical for human readers, because it is difficult to determine the order of the twists.\n\n\n=== Fiore method ===\nRather than numbers, Albert Fiore uses letters to refer to the direction the second (rightward) section is turned in relation to the first (leftward) section: D, L, U, and R. These are listed consecutively rather than numbered, so that a completely straight figure rather than being presumed as a starting point is notated DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD.\n\n\n== Mathematical formulation ==\nThe number of different shapes of the Rubik's Snake is at most 423 = 70368744177664 (⁠ ⁠≈⁠ ⁠7×1013 or 70 trillion), i.e. 23 turning areas with 4 positions each. The real number of different shapes is lower, since some configurations are spatially impossible (because they would require multiple prisms to occupy the same region of space). Peter Aylett computed by an exhaustive search that 13446591920995 (≈ 1.3×1013 or 13 Trillion) positions are possible when prohibiting prism collisions, or passing through a collision to reach another position; or 6721828475867\nRubik, the Amazing Cube is a 1983 half-hour Saturday morning animated series based on the puzzle created by Ernő Rubik, produced by Ruby-Spears Enterprises and broadcast as part of The Pac-Man/Rubik, the Amazing Cube Hour block on ABC from September 10 to December 10, 1983 and continued in reruns until September 1, 1984. The Rubik half hour was broadcast in reruns as a standalone series on ABC from May 4 to August 31, 1985.\nThe program features a magic Rubik's Cube named Rubik who can fly through the air and has other special powers. Rubik can only come alive when he is in a solved state. The voice of Rubik, Ron Palillo, told TV Guide in 1983 that for the role, he spoke very slowly and then technicians sped up the tapes and raised the pitch in an Alvin and the Chipmunks–esque manner. Palillo said Rubik's giggle was very different from the trademark laugh of Horshack, his character on the TV series Welcome Back, Kotter, and that it was pretty \"for an inanimate object\". It was also one of the first American animated series to feature a mainly Hispanic and Latino American roster of characters, along with voice actors.\n\n\n== Premise ==\nRubik falls out of the stagecoach of an evil magician, who later becomes the main villain of the series. Rubik helps Carlos, Lisa, and Reynaldo Rodriguez in foiling the magician’s attempts to recover him. \nSome episodes also deal with more normal adversaries, such as when a bully trying to thwart Reynaldo's efforts to impress a girl. \nFor dramatic purposes, Rubik often gets easily fully scrambled, such as by being dropped or grabbed by the family dog. The puzzle is usually solved quickly by the Rodriguez children, although in stressful circumstances it takes them longer. When scrambled, Rubik can only be heard speaking gibberish and can sometimes be heard saying, \"Help.\"\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRon Palillo as Rubik\nMichael Bell as Reynaldo Rodriguez\nJennifer Fajardo as Lisa Rodriguez\nMichael Saucedo as Carlos Rodriguez\nAngela Moya as Marla\nAdditional voices: Jack DeLeon, Alan Dinehart, Laurie Faso, Takayo Fischer, Bob Holt, Tress MacNeille, Tysun McMullan, Neil Ross, John Stephenson, Janet Waldo, Alan Young\n\n\n== Theme song ==\nTying into the human characters being Hispanic Americans, the theme song was sung by Puerto Rican boy band Menudo.

Wiggs and Christopher J. Taylor. The Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ernő Rubik bought the patent from them to market the product under his name.  It was first marketed in 1988.\nThe Rubik's Clock is a two-sided puzzle, each side presenting nine clocks to the puzzler. There are four dials, one at each corner of the puzzle, each allowing the corresponding corner clock to be rotated directly.  (The corner clocks, unlike the other clocks, rotate on both sides of the puzzle simultaneously and can never be operated independently.  Thus the puzzle contains only 14 independent clocks.)\nThere are also four pins which span both sides of the puzzle; each pin arranged such that if it is \"in\" on one side, it is \"out\" on the other. The state of each pin (in or out) determines whether the adjacent corner clock is mechanically connected to the three other adjacent clocks on the front side or on the back side: thus the configuration of the pins determines which sets of clocks can be turned simultaneously by rotating a suitable dial.\nThe aim of the puzzle is to set all nine clocks to 12 o'clock (straight up) on both sides of the puzzle simultaneously. The method to do so is to start by constructing a cross on both sides (at 12 o’clock) and then solving the corner clocks.\nThe Rubik’s clock is listed as one of the 17 WCA events, with records for fastest time to solve one puzzle, and the fastest average time to solve 5 puzzles (discarding the slowest and fastest times).\n\n\n== Combinations ==\nSince there are 14 independent clocks, with 12 settings each, there are a total of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          12\n          \n            14\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 12^{14}}\n  \n=1,283,918,464,548,864 possible combinations for the clock faces.

The most famous of those puzzles is the Rubik's Cube. Since the start of the WCA there have been over 11,700 competitions. The WCA was founded by Ron van Bruchem of the Netherlands and Tyson Mao of the United States in 2004. The goal of the World Cube Association is to have \"more competitions in more countries with more people and more fun, under fair and equal conditions.\" In 2017, they started work to become a non-profit organization and on November 20, 2017, the state of California accepted the initial registration of the World Cube Association.\nThe organization is run by the board members. It assigns different teams and committees as well as delegates who can organize official competitions. The presence of a delegate is required to make the competition official.

Extensions of the Rubik's cube have been around for a long time and come in both hardware and software forms. The major extension have been the availability of cubes of larger size and the availability of the more complex cubes with marked centres. The properties of Rubik’s family cubes of any size together with some special attention to software cubes is the main focus of this article. Many properties are mathematical in nature and are functions of the cube size variable.\n\n\n== Definitions ==\nIn the main, the terminology used here is in agreement with what is in general use. Elsewhere, some terms are used with different meanings. To avoid misconceptions, the meaning of most terms in use in this article is defined below.\n\n\n== Cube types ==\n\n\n=== Hardware cubes ===\nHardware (physical) cubes are based on the original size 3 cube invented by Ernő Rubik in 1974. These cubes usually use coloured stickers on the facelets for cubie identification. The size 3 standard Rubik’s cube gained peak interest in the 1980s and was closely followed by the size 4 (Rubik's Revenge) cube. Other, usually more recently available, hardware forms of the cube come in size 2 (Pocket Cube), size 5 (Professor's Cube), size 6 (V-Cube 6), and size 7 (V-Cube 7). Lesser known hardware cubes of larger sizes have also been produced. Currently, the largest hardware cube made is size 49, and the largest mass-produced is size 21.\n\n\n=== Software cubes ===\nIn parallel with the hardware form of the cube there are many software forms available that obey the same rules as the hardware forms. Software cube emulators are not subject to the physical restraints that impose a size limit on the hardware forms. Hence the only really big cubes available are those in software form. Also, unlike the hardware forms, a range of cube sizes can easily be accommodated by the one program. The design characteristics of programs that allow users to unscramble cubes vary considerably with such features as the capability to allow the user to save a partially unscrambled state being often available.\nSoftware cubes were in use in the 1980s when monochrome monitors were in common use. The lack of colour meant a different way of face identification was required. A program that retained 1980s monochrome capability (using numerals 1 to 6 to identify facelets) for cubes in the size 2 to 11 range was produced in 1991 (together with colour capability in the size 2 to 15 range). More recently developed software cubes use coloured facelets as for hardware cubes.\nThe most common, but by no means universal, approach is to emulate the cube by providing a \"three-dimensional\" display of the cube that makes it look like a real hardware cube. A drawback of the \"three-dimensional\" display is that, without some extra enhancements, the state of parts of the cube for any given view is hidden.\nOther interactive software approaches that do not emulate a three-dimensional cube are also used by some programmers. Generally, an aim of such approaches is to allow the state of all cubies to be in view all the time but has the disadvantage (for some viewers) that the display does not appear like a real-world cube. A conventional two-dimensional (unfolded) display with all cube elements appearing of equal size is one approach. Another form of display where all cube elements do not appear of equal size is also in use. The upper cube size limit for software cubes is limited by the monitor’s available pixels and what viewers find as acceptable which, in turn, is a function of their visual acuity. For cubes of large size it can be advantageous to allow a portion of the cube to be scrolled out of view.\nAll emulators provide a means for the user to change the cube state step-by-step and unscramble the cube. Most emulators use mouse movements to control the rotation of the cube elemen\nThe Simple Solution to Rubik's Cube by James G. Nourse is a book that was published in 1981. The book explains how to solve the Rubik's Cube. The book became the best-selling book of 1981, selling 6,680,000 copies that year. It was the fastest-selling title in the 36-year history of Bantam Books.\n\n\n== Writing ==\nNourse wrote the book at the age of 33 while on the staff of the Chemistry Department at Stanford University. Shortly before Christmas 1980 he bought a Rubik's Cube intending to give it away as a present. Instead he spent the holiday season working out a solution (a \"Layer by Layer\" method), which he published as a 32-page pamphlet for the university bookstore. It reached the hands of a publisher at Bantam who persuaded Nourse to expand the guide into a 64-page book.\n\n\n== Publication ==\nThe book was published June 1981. It became the best-selling book of 1981, selling 6,680,000 copies that year. It was the fastest-selling title in the 36-year history of Bantam Books.\nIn November 1981 Nourse published a sequel, The Simple Solutions to Cubic Puzzles, as an aid to the numerous puzzles that were spawned by the Cube-craze.\n\n\n== Content ==\nThe book begins with a summary of the history of the development of the Rubik's cube by Ernö Rubik and apparently independently by Terutoshi Ishige. The James Nourse method has several features that distinguish it from others: \n\nIt is guaranteed to work\nIt offers clear and steady progress\nIt presents few and uncomplicated decisions\nIt allows for error\nIt features a low number of easy to memorize sequences of moves\nIt is independent of colour\nThe book's solution to the cube was considered to be one of the easiest, simplest, and most straightforward solutions to solving the cube.\n\n\n== Other Methods ==\nMany later solutions to Rubik's Cube published on the internet seem to be based at least in part on the solution in this book. \nThe relatively few sequences one is required to memorize makes it one of the easiest solutions to remember — but this incurs the cost of a relatively high number of moves for a solution — about 100 moves average according to the book on page 54. The author claims he can solve random cube problems by this method in about 2 1/2 minutes (IBID p.54). \nHowever, this ease and simplicity involves a tradeoff in that this solution takes longer than other solutions that are harder and more complex. \n\n\n=== Nomenclature ===\nIn his book, Nourse used an original notation different from that of David Singmaster, which was not yet widely known in 1981. What Nourse called T and B (for Top and Bottom), became popularly known as U and D (for Up and Down). To avoid single-letter ambiguity, the rear face is called Posterior, represented by P (although none of the algorithms presented in the book actually uses the posterior face in its move sequences). \nClockwise and counterclockwise moves are made explicit with + and − (instead of relying on primes to denote counterclockwise, and their absence to denote clockwise).  \nThus, for example, Nourse gives the algorithm for rotating three corners of the bottom face anticlockwise (solving the position Lars Petrus named the \"Sune\") as follows:\n\n R− B− R+ B− R− B2 R+ B2\n\nIn Singmaster's notation, the same move sequence would be written: \n\n R' D' R D' R' D2 R D2\n\n\n== Speed Cubing and Erata ==\nThe book mentions speed cubing on page 56 — citing the following times: \n\n20 minutes - whiz\n10 minutes - speed demon\n5 minutes - expert\n3 minutes - master of cube (M.C.)\nGiven the method requires an average of 100 moves for a solve (IBID p.54), this would be fairly reasonable for the time. However as better methods (i.e. more complex but faster), and better cubes have become available — in 2023 this would have to be revised: \n\n60 seconds - whiz\n40 seconds - speed demon\n15-25 seconds - expert\n3-5 seconds - world champion\nThe better methods allow solves in 50-70 moves, and optimal solutions exist at around 20 moves — this greatly improves the ability to solve a cub\nAn Infinity cube is a kind of mechanical puzzle toy with mathematical principles. Its shape is similar to a 2×2 Rubik's cube. It can be opened and put back together from different directions, thus creating a visually interesting effect.\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\nThe principle of the infinity cube is simple and can be made by hand with simple paper cutting and pasting. First make 8 small cubes, then arrange the small cubes in a 2 by 2 by 2 way, and tape 8 edges together. When combined, there are 28 small squares exposed and 20 small squares hidden inside.\n\n\n== Mathematics ==\nLike the Rubik's Cube, the various states of the Infinity Cube can be represented as a group, but the Infinity Cube has far fewer permutations than the Rubik's Cube.\nRubik's Cube group have \n  \n    \n      \n        43,252,003,274,489,856,000\n        \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              12\n              !\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n        ⋅\n        \n          2\n          \n            12\n            −\n            1\n          \n        \n        ⋅\n        8\n        !\n        ⋅\n        \n          3\n          \n            8\n            −\n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 43{,}252{,}003{,}274{,}489{,}856{,}000\\,\\!={\\frac {12!}{2}}\\cdot 2^{12-1}\\cdot 8!\\cdot 3^{8-1}}\n  \n permutations and isomorphic to the below group, where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A_{n}}\n  \n are alternating groups and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            Z\n          \n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} _{n}}\n  \n are cyclic groups:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          \n            Z\n          \n          \n            3\n          \n          \n            7\n          \n        \n        ×\n        \n          \n            Z\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n          \n            11\n          \n        \n        )\n        ⋊\n        \n        (\n        (\n        \n          A\n          \n            8\n          \n        \n        ×\n        \n          A\n          \n            12\n          \n        \n        )\n        ⋊\n        \n          \n            Z\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (\\mathbb {Z} _{3}^{7}\\times \\mathbb {Z} _{2}^{11})\\rtimes \\,((A_{8}\\times A_{12})\\rtimes \\mathbb {Z} _{2}).}\n  \n\nThe largest group representation for Infinity Cube only contains 6 elements, and can be represented as:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            Z\n          \n          \n            6\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} _{6}}\n  \n\n\n== See also ==\nPaper model\nFidget Cube\n15 puzzle\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMagic Folding Cube - Mathematische-Basteleien\nHow To Make A Paper INFINITY CUBE! on YouTube\nA combination puzzle, also known as a sequential move puzzle, is a puzzle which consists of a set of pieces which can be manipulated into different combinations by a group of operations. Many such puzzles are mechanical puzzles of polyhedral shape, consisting of multiple layers of pieces along each axis which can rotate independently of each other. Collectively known as twisty puzzles, the archetype of this kind of puzzle is the Rubik's Cube. Each rotating side is usually marked with different colours, intended to be scrambled, then solved by a sequence of moves that sort the facets by colour. Generally, combination puzzles also include mathematically defined examples that have not been, or are impossible to, physically construct.\n\n\n== Description ==\nA combination puzzle is solved by achieving a particular combination starting from a random (scrambled) combination. Often, the solution is required to be some recognisable pattern such as \"all like colours together\" or \"all numbers in order\". The most famous of these puzzles is the original Rubik's Cube, a cubic puzzle in which each of the six faces can be independently rotated. Each of the six faces is a different colour, but each of the nine pieces on a face is identical in colour in the solved condition. In the unsolved condition, colours are distributed amongst the pieces of the cube. Puzzles like the Rubik's Cube which are manipulated by rotating a section of pieces are popularly called twisty puzzles. They are often face-turning, but commonly exist in corner-turning and edge-turning varieties.\nThe mechanical construction of the puzzle will usually define the rules by which the combination of pieces can be altered. This leads to some limitations on what combinations are possible. For instance, in the case of the Rubik's Cube, there are a large number of combinations that can be achieved by randomly placing the coloured stickers on the cube, but not all of these can be achieved by manipulating the cube rotations. Similarly, not all the combinations that are mechanically possible from a disassembled cube are possible by manipulation of the puzzle. Since neither unpeeling the stickers nor disassembling the cube is an allowed operation, the possible operations of rotating various faces limit what can be achieved.\nAlthough a mechanical realization of the puzzle is usual, it is not actually necessary. It is only necessary that the rules for the operations are defined. The puzzle can be realized entirely in virtual space or as a set of mathematical statements. In fact, there are some puzzles that can only be realized in virtual space. An example is the 4-dimensional 3×3×3×3 tesseract puzzle, simulated by the MagicCube4D software.\n\n\n== Types ==\nThere have been many different shapes of Rubik type puzzles constructed. As well as cubes, all of the regular polyhedra and many of the semi-regular and stellated polyhedra have been made.\n\n\n=== Regular cuboids ===\nA cuboid is a rectilinear polyhedron. That is, all its edges form right angles. Or in other words (in the majority of cases), a box shape. A regular cuboid, in the context of this article, is a cuboid puzzle where all the pieces are the same size in edge length. Pieces are often referred to as \"cubies\".\n\n\n==== Pattern variations ====\nThere are many puzzles which are mechanically identical to the regular cuboids listed above but have variations in the pattern and colour of design. Some of these are custom made in very small numbers, sometimes for promotional events. The ones listed in the table below are included because the pattern in some way affects the difficulty of the solution or is notable in some other way.\n\n\n===== Sudoku Cube =====\nThe Sudoku Cube or Sudokube is a variation on a Rubik's Cube in which the aim is to solve one or more Sudoku puzzles on the sides or rows. The toy was originally created in 2006 by Jay Horowitz in Sebring, Ohio. It was subsequently produced in China, marketed and sold internationally.\n\n\n====== Pr\nThe Rubik's Revolution is a handheld electronic game invented, designed, developed and patented by Rehco, LLC, a Chicago toy and game inventing firm. The Rubik's Revolution was formerly distributed by Techno Source and received the 2008 TOTY Game of the Year Award. 11-12 years later, it would be revamped by Techno Source's parent company, Super Impulse and be regarded as one of the many toys that would help battle boredom in the Covid-19 Pandemic according to Time To Play Mag  Designed to resemble the classic Rubik's Cube puzzle, the device is a single rigid cube; it is about as large as a Professor's Cube, with each face subdivided into 9 square sub-faces. The center square of each face features a recessed LED-lit button colored to correspond with the stickers on the remaining squares. Gameplay involves pressing the buttons when they light up, or when directed to by the game's recorded voice.\nThis gameplay is completely different from that of the Rubik's Cube, despite the physical resemblance to the Rubik's Cube's solved state. There are no separate, movable sub-cubes as with the Rubik's Cube; the 6 faces are of uniform, unchanging color, and the 9 facets on each face are fixed in place.\n\n\n== Features ==\n\nThe Rubik's Revolution 15 includes 6 electronic games, using the 6 lighted buttons in the recessed squares at the center of each face of the cube and the internal speaker. These games are called \"Light Speed\", \"Rapid Recharge\", \"Pattern Panic\", \"Cube Catcher\", \"Multiplayer Madness\", and \"Code Cracker\". A secret seventh mode is accessible by studying the instruction manual, referred to only as the \"ultimate cube challenge\" by the manual. There is also a Titanium Edition, an Ice Edition, a Micro Edition and the Super \nImpulse 2019 Reboot. The Titanium comes equipped with a memory system that keeps track of scores. The Ice Edition also keeps track of score but also tracks progress. The Micro Edition is a keychain-style cube on which only a shorter version of Light Speed can be played.\nAn electronic voice is used to guide the players both during game play and for configuration, such as\nchanging the volume, which is done by pressing the Yellow & Silver squares when turning on the game. The games also employ various other sound effects, such as a \"ding\" sound when a button is pressed.\n\n\n=== Light Speed (blue) ===\nOne button will light up, and the player has a certain amount of time to press the correct button. As the player makes progress, the player has less time to press the correct button. The game ends if the player presses the wrong button, runs out of time, or beats the game with the maximum score of 999 (20 minutes). The Titanium version of Light Speed allows scores of over 2,384 points (over an hour's worth of game play). The Ice Edition allows scores of over 9,999 points (which is 7,615 more points than the Titanium Edition). The Micro Edition has a maximum score of 99 and, unlike the other editions, has a ranking system for how well a person plays.\n\n\n=== Rapid Recharge (yellow (2007 versions), silver (2019-2020 Super Impulse Version)) ===\nButtons will randomly light up for a short period of time. When a button has been lit for a certain amount of time, it will start flashing and a warning alarm will sound. The player must rapidly press that button to \"recharge\" it. The player wins if they can simultaneously charge every button. The game ends when the player fails to recharge any of the buttons in time, or beats the game. This game was renamed \"Full Charge\" on the 2019-2020 SuperImpulse Edition and adds in a new mechanic, it will also use a timer to tell the player how much time he has to recharge the button before the warning alarm goes off.\n\n\n=== Pattern Panic (green) ===\nA sequence of buttons light up and their colors are spoken, starting with one button on the first round, two on the next, etc. The player has five seconds to correctly press the same sequence of buttons. After a few rounds, the next level is unlocked. \nGod's algorithm is a notion originating in discussions of ways to solve the Rubik's Cube puzzle, but which can also be applied to other combinatorial puzzles and mathematical games. It refers to any algorithm which produces a solution having the fewest possible moves. The allusion to the deity is based on the notion that an omniscient being would know an optimal step from any given configuration.\n\n\n== Scope ==\n\n\n=== Definition ===\nThe notion applies to puzzles that can assume a finite number of \"configurations\", with a relatively small, well-defined arsenal of \"moves\" that may be applicable to configurations and then lead to a new configuration. Solving the puzzle means to reach a designated \"final configuration\", a singular configuration, or one of a collection of configurations. To solve the puzzle a sequence of moves is applied, starting from some arbitrary initial configuration.\n\n\n=== Solution ===\nAn algorithm can be considered to solve such a puzzle if it takes as input an arbitrary initial configuration and produces as output a sequence of moves leading to a final configuration (if the puzzle is solvable from that initial configuration, otherwise it signals the impossibility of a solution). A solution is optimal if the sequence of moves is as short as possible. The highest value of this, among all initial configurations, is known as God's number, or, more formally, the minimax value. God's algorithm, then, for a given puzzle, is an algorithm that solves the puzzle and produces only optimal solutions.\nSome writers, such as David Joyner, consider that for an algorithm to be properly referred to as \"God's algorithm\", it should also be practical, meaning that the algorithm does not require extraordinary amounts of memory or time.  For example, using a giant lookup table indexed by initial configurations would allow solutions to be found very quickly, but would require an extraordinary amount of memory.\nInstead of asking for a full solution, one can equivalently ask for a single move from an initial but not final configuration, where the move is the first of some optimal solution. An algorithm for the single-move version of the problem can be turned into an algorithm for the original problem by invoking it repeatedly while applying each move reported to the present configuration, until a final one is reached; conversely, any algorithm for the original problem can be turned into an algorithm for the single-move version by truncating its output to its first move.\n\n\n== Examples ==\nWell-known puzzles fitting this description are mechanical puzzles such as Rubik's Cube, the Tower of Hanoi, and the 15 puzzle. The one-person game of peg solitaire is also covered, as well as many logic puzzles, such as the missionaries and cannibals problem. These have in common that they can be modeled mathematically as a directed graph, in which the configurations are the vertices, and the moves are the arcs.\n\n\n=== Mechanical puzzles ===\n\n\n==== n-Puzzles ====\nThe Fifteen puzzle can be solved in 80 single-tile moves or 43 multi-tile moves in the worst case. For its generalization the n-puzzle, the problem of finding an optimal solution is NP-hard, so it is not known whether there is a practical God's algorithm.\n\n\n==== Towers of Hanoi ====\nFor the Towers of Hanoi puzzle, a God's algorithm is known for any given number of disks. The number of moves increases exponentially with the number of disks (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          2\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        −\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2^{n}-1}\n  \n).\n\n\n==== Rubik's Cube ====\n\nAn algorithm to determine the minimum number of moves to solve Rubik's Cube was published in 1997 by Richard Korf. While it had been known since 1995 that 20 was a lower bound on the number of moves for the solution in the worst case, Tom Rokicki proved in 2010 that no configuration requires more than 20 moves. Thus, 20 is a sharp upper bound on the length of optimal solutions.

Announced in June 2020, the film was directed by Sue Kim and premiered on July 29, 2020, on Netflix.\n\n\n=== Venue featured ===\nSome of the footage was shot at the World Cube Association's World Championships 2019 held in Melbourne, Australia.\n\n\n== Premise ==\nThe documentary captures the \"extraordinary twists and turns in the journeys of Rubik's Cube-solving champions Max Park and Feliks Zemdegs.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAs per the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 100% of 13 critic reviews are considered positive, with an average rating of 8.2 out of 10 On February 9, 2021, the documentary was shortlisted in the Documentary Short Subject category of the 93rd Academy Awards. At the 5th Critics' Choice Documentary Awards, The Speed Cubers was nominated for Best Short Documentary. The film also received a nomination for the Peabody Award under the documentaries category.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCubers, another documentary about speedcubing\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Speed Cubers at IMDb\nThe Speed Cubers on Netflix \nOfficial trailer\nThe superflip or 12-flip is a special configuration on a Rubik's Cube, in which all the edge and corner pieces are in the correct permutation, and the eight corners are correctly oriented, but all twelve edges are oriented incorrectly (\"flipped\").\nThe term superflip is also used to refer to any algorithm that transforms the Rubik's Cube from its solved state into the superflip configuration.\n\n\n== Properties ==\nThe superflip is a completely symmetrical combination, which means applying a superflip algorithm to the cube will always yield the same position, irrespective of the orientation in which the cube is held.\nThe superflip is self-inverse; i.e. performing a superflip algorithm twice will bring the cube back to the starting position.\nFurthermore, the superflip is the only nontrivial central configuration of the Rubik's Cube. This means that it is commutative with all other algorithms – i.e. performing any algorithm X followed by a superflip algorithm yields exactly the same position as performing the superflip algorithm first followed by X – and it is the only configuration (except trivially for the solved state) with this property. By extension, this implies that a commutator of a superflip and any other algorithm will always bring the cube back to its solved position.\n\n\n== Algorithms ==\nThe table below shows four possible algorithms that transform a solved Rubik's Cube into its superflip configuration, together with the number of moves each algorithm has under each metric:\n\nthe most commonly-used half-turn metric (HTM), in which rotating a face (or outer layer) either 90° or 180° counts as a single move, but a \"slice-turn\" – i.e. rotating a centre layer – counts as two separate moves (equivalent to rotating the two outer layers in the opposite direction);\nthe quarter-turn metric (QTM), in which only 90° face-turns count as single moves; thus, a 180° turn counts as two separate moves, while a slice-turn counts as either two or four moves (depending on whether the slice is moved 90° or 180°);\nthe slice-turn metric (STM), in which 90° face-turns, 180° face-turns, and slice-turns (both 90° and 180° centre-layer rotations) all count as single moves.\nAll the algorithms below are recorded in Singmaster notation:\n\nIt has been shown that the shortest path between a solved cube and the superflip requires 20 moves under HTM (the first algorithm is one such example), and that no position requires more moves. Contrary to popular belief, however, the superflip is not unique in this regard: there are many other positions that also require 20 moves.\nUnder the more restrictive QTM, the superflip requires at least 24 moves (the second algorithm above is one such sequence), and is not maximally distant from the solved state. Instead, when superflip is composed with the \"four-dot\" or \"four-spot\" position, in which four faces have their centres exchanged with the centres on the opposite face, the resulting position requires 26 moves under QTM.\nUnder STM, the superflip requires at least 16 moves (as shown by the third algorithm).\nThe last solution in the table is not optimal under any metric, but is both easiest to learn and fastest to do for humans, as the sequence of moves is very repetitive.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGod's algorithm\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDavid Joyner (2008).

Rubik's 360 was introduced on February 5, 2009 at the Nürnberg International Toy Fair ahead of its worldwide release in August.\nIn contrast to most of Rubik's puzzles, Rubik's 360 is a physical challenge requiring manual dexterity rather than learning and memorizing algorithms. The puzzle involves moving six balls, each a different color, from a central sphere to six color-coded compartments in the outer sphere. This is done by maneuvering them through a middle sphere that only has two holes. There are three spheres that make up the puzzle.\nLike Rubik's Cube, Rubik's 360 has only one solution, but it cannot be solved by being broken apart. It is considered suitable for all ages and reviews described it as addictive and engaging.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBall-in-a-maze puzzle\nPerplexus\nRubik's Revenge\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRubik's official website\nCreator Ernő Rubik introduces the Rubik's 360  Exclusive interview with TIME\nRubik's 360 News and Discussions\nOfficial UK website for the Rubik's 360\nTyson Mao (born May 8, 1984) is an American Rubik's Cube speedsolver. He is a co-founder and a former board member of the World Cube Association, an organization that holds competitive events for the Rubik's Cube.  In 2005, he set the world record for 3x3x3 blindfolded. In 2006, he appeared on the CW Television Network's Beauty and the Geek as one of the participants of the second incarnation of the reality television show.\n\n\n== Personal ==\nTyson Mao was born in San Francisco to immigrant parents from Tainan, Taiwan. He lives in the San Francisco Bay Area and previously used to work as a Poker Product Manager for Zynga. Mao graduated from the California Institute of Technology in 2006 with a degree in astrophysics. His father is a doctor based in South San Francisco.\nIn 2017, Mao opened the Wursthall Restaurant & Bierhaus in San Mateo, California with partners Adam Simpson and J. Kenji López-Alt.\n\n\n== Rubik's Cube ==\nTyson began solving the cube during the Rubik's Cube's second boom in 2003, first using a beginner's method, then the Petrus and Fridrich methods. Tyson is credited for popularizing the \"Caltech move\" for solving the three diagonal corner permutation in blindfold solving.\n\n\n=== Competition Organizer ===\nTyson has been the main organizer of major U.S competitions, including all US Nationals up to 2013, as well as many Caltech competitions.\n\n\n=== Tyson Mao's beginner method ===\nTyson Mao's unofficial beginner method is a set of 8 videos which can be viewed at Rubiks.com. This method is most famous for being used by Will Smith in a past film The Pursuit of Happyness, that was released in 2006. The method is basically a simplified layer-by-layer approach which works much the same way as the Fridrich method. The difference is that the cross is first built around the opposite side to simplify the permutation foresight required, the first two layers are permuted individually, the last layer requires an algorithm to construct a cross, and then repetition of Lars Petrus' Sune algorithm to orient, and finally permutation requires the use of two algorithms, one for the corners and one for the edges. These algorithms may have to be executed multiple times.\n\n\n== Media appearances ==\nBeauty and the Geek Season 2\nCNN's Anderson Cooper 360° (Air date: December 15, 2006)\nIdentity\nThe Tonight Show with Jay Leno (Air date: January 27, 2006)\nTwins\nUSA Network: Show Us Your Character\nGood Morning America (Air date: February 4, 2008)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Brain Trust Behind 'Beauty And The Geek' Says More Stereotype Breaking In Works\".

Since 1988, the arrangement of colours has been standardised, with white opposite yellow, blue opposite green, and orange opposite red, and with the red, white, and blue arranged clockwise, in that order.

The fixed centers have two sections (one visible, one hidden) which can turn independently. This feature is unique to the original design.\nThe Eastsheen version of the puzzle uses a different mechanism. The fixed centers hold the centers next to the central edges in place, which in turn hold the outer edges. The non-central edges hold the corners in place, and the internal sections of the corner pieces do not reach the center of the cube."

There are three mutually perpendicular grooves for the centre pieces to slide through. Each groove is only wide enough to allow one row of centre pieces to slide through it. The ball is shaped to prevent the centre pieces of the other row from sliding, ensuring that the ball remains aligned with the outside of the cube. Turning one of the centre layers moves either just that layer or the ball as well."

The location of these cubes relative to one another can be altered by twisting the layers of the cube, but the location of the coloured sides relative to one another in the completed state of the puzzle cannot be altered: it is fixed by the relative positions of the centre squares and the distribution of colour combinations on edge and corner pieces.

It proved a useful tool for teaching algebraic group theory, and in late 1977 Konsumex, Hungary's state trading company, began marketing it. By 1980 Rubik's Cube was marketed throughout the world, and over 100 million authorized units, with an estimated 50 million unauthorized imitations, were sold, mostly during its subsequent three years of popularity. Approximately 50 books were published describing how to solve the puzzle of Rubik's Cube. Following his cube's popularity, Rubik opened a studio to develop designs in 1984; among its products was another popular puzzle toy, Rubik's Magic."

Around the same time, Matchbox also produced Rubik's Magic Create the Cube, a \"Level Two\" version of Rubik's Magic, in which the puzzle is solved when folded into a cube with a base of two tiles, and the tile colors match at the corners of the cube.

Collectively known as twisty puzzles, the archetype of this kind of puzzle is the Rubik's Cube. Each rotating side is usually marked with different colours, intended to be scrambled, then solved by a sequence of moves that sort the facets by colour.

Often, the solution is required to be some recognisable pattern such as \"all like colours together\" or \"all numbers in order\". The most famous of these puzzles is the original Rubik's Cube, a cubic puzzle in which each of the six faces can be independently rotated. Each of the six faces is a different colour, but each of the nine pieces on a face is identical in colour in the solved condition. In the unsolved condition, colours are distributed amongst the pieces of the cube. Puzzles like the Rubik's Cube which are manipulated by rotating a section of pieces are popularly called twisty puzzles. They are often face-turning, but commonly exist in corner-turning and edge-turning varieties."

Similarly, not all the combinations that are mechanically possible from a disassembled cube are possible by manipulation of the puzzle.

That is, all its edges form right angles. Or in other words (in the majority of cases), a box shape. A regular cuboid, in the context of this article, is a cuboid puzzle where all the pieces are the same size in edge length.

A solution is optimal if the sequence of moves is as short as possible. The highest value of this, among all initial configurations, is known as God's number, or, more formally, the minimax value.

An algorithm for the single-move version of the problem can be turned into an algorithm for the original problem by invoking it repeatedly while applying each move reported to the present configuration, until a final one is reached; conversely, any algorithm for the original problem can be turned into an algorithm for the single-move version by truncating its output to its first move."

Instead, when superflip is composed with the \"four-dot\" or \"four-spot\" position, in which four faces have their centres exchanged with the centres on the opposite face, the resulting position requires 26 moves under QTM.\nUnder STM, the superflip requires at least 16 moves (as shown by the third algorithm).\nThe last solution in the table is not optimal under any metric, but is both easiest to learn and fastest to do for humans, as the sequence of moves is very repetitive."

Rubik's 360 was introduced on February 5, 2009 at the Nürnberg International Toy Fair ahead of its worldwide release in August.\nIn contrast to most of Rubik's puzzles, Rubik's 360 is a physical challenge requiring manual dexterity rather than learning and memorizing algorithms. The puzzle involves moving six balls, each a different color, from a central sphere to six color-coded compartments in the outer sphere. This is done by maneuvering them through a middle sphere that only has two holes. There are three spheres that make up the puzzle."

The method is basically a simplified layer-by-layer approach which works much the same way as the Fridrich method. The difference is that the cross is first built around the opposite side to simplify the permutation foresight required, the first two layers are permuted individually, the last layer requires an algorithm to construct a cross, and then repetition of Lars Petrus' Sune algorithm to orient, and finally permutation requires the use of two algorithms, one for the corners and one for the edges. These algorithms may have to be executed multiple times."

        "content": "This is a list of the most populous municipal corporations of the United States. As defined by the United States Census Bureau, an incorporated place includes cities, towns, villages, boroughs, and municipalities. A few exceptional census-designated places (CDPs) are also included in the Census Bureau's listing of incorporated places. Consolidated city-counties represent a distinct type of government that includes the entire population of a county, or county equivalent. Some consolidated city-counties, however, include multiple incorporated places. This list presents only the portion of such consolidated city-counties that are not a part of another incorporated place.\nThis list refers only to the population of individual municipalities within their defined limits; the populations of other municipalities considered suburbs of a central city are listed separately, and unincorporated areas within urban agglomerations are not included. Therefore, a different ranking is evident when considering U.S. urban areas or metropolitan areas.\n\n\n== 50 states and Washington, D.C. ==\nThis table lists the 336 incorporated places in the United States, excluding the U.S. territories, with a population of at least 100,000 as of July 1, 2023, as estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau. Five states have no cities with populations exceeding 100,000. They are: Delaware, Maine, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming.\nThe table displays:\n\nThe city rank by population as of July 1, 2023, as estimated by the United States Census Bureau\nThe city name\nThe name of the state in which the city lies\nThe city population as of July 1, 2023, as estimated by the United States Census Bureau\nThe city population as of April 1, 2020, as enumerated by the 2020 United States census\nThe city percent population change from April 1, 2020, to July 1, 2023\nThe city land area as of January 1, 2020\nThe city population density as of April 1, 2020 (residents per unit of land area)\nThe city latitude and longitude coordinates\n  \n\n \n\n\n=== Distribution ===\nThe total 2020 enumerated population of all cities over 100,000 is 96,598,047, representing 29.14% of the United States population (excluding territories) and covering a total land area of 29,588 square miles (76,630 km2). The mean city population is 301,765, and the mean density is 4,151 inhabitants per square mile (1,603/km2).\n\n\n=== Gallery ===\n\n\n== Puerto Rico ==\n  \n\nThe following table lists the five municipalities (municipios) of Puerto Rico with a population greater than 100,000 on July 1, 2023, as estimated by the United States Census Bureau.\nIf Puerto Rico were included with the broader U.S. list, San Juan would be the 58th largest city in the country.\nThe table below contains the following information:\n\nThe municipio rank by population as of July 1, 2023, as estimated by the United States Census Bureau\nThe municipio\nThe municipio population as of July 1, 2023, as estimated by the United States Census Bureau\nThe municipio population as of April 1, 2020, as enumerated by the 2020 United States census\nThe municipio percent population change from April 1, 2020, to July 1, 2023\nThe municipio land area as of January 1, 2020\nThe municipio population density as of April 1, 2020 (residents per land area)\nThe municipio latitude and longitude coordinates\n\n\n== Other U.S. territories ==\nAs of 2023, four U.S. territories — American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands — have no cities with at least 100,000 people.\n\n\n== Census-designated places ==\n  \nThe following table lists U.S. census-designated places (CDPs) with populations of at least 100,000 according to the 2020 census. A CDP is a concentration of population identified by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes. CDPs are delineated for each decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places such as cities, towns and villages. CDPs are populated areas that lack separate municipal government, but which otherwise physic\nThe following is a list of incorporated places in the United States with a population density of over 10,000 people per square mile. As defined by the United States Census Bureau, an incorporated place is a place that has a self-governing local government and as such has been \"incorporated\" by the state it is in. Each state has different laws defining how a place can be incorporated. An \"incorporated place\" as recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau can designate a variety of places, such as a city, town, village, borough, and township.\nThe other type of place defined by the U.S. Census Bureau for statistical purposes are census-designated places. Census-designated places are distinct from incorporated places because they do not have a local government and thus depend on higher government bodies, such as a county, for governance. Census-designated places are defined as being in an unincorporated area. Census-designated places that have a population density of over 10,000 people per square mile are listed in a separate table below. The five boroughs of New York City, and the census-designated places of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands that have densities over 10,000, are also listed in separate tables below.\n\n\n== Incorporated places with a density of over 10,000 people per square mile ==\nThe following data about the most densely populated incorporated places in the United States is from the U.S. Census Bureau and is from the 2020 U.S. Census, except for the tables on Puerto Rico, which show data from the 2000 US Census. The following ranking is made up of incorporated places of any population, but also of interest may be lists compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau of all places with at least 50,000 population, arranged alphabetically by state, and ranked by total population; the population density for each place is also given in the lists.\nThe population density is calculated by dividing the population by the land area so that it represents the number of people living in one square mile of land area. The population densities listed in the table below do not work out to be exactly the result of dividing the listed population by the listed land area because the land areas have been rounded off to two decimal places, but the population densities were calculated before rounding the land area figures. The land area figures are calculated using the U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER system. The U.S. Census Bureau has released the exact land area figures for all places in the U.S. in square meters and square miles; the exact land areas are the figures used for calculating the population densities seen in the table below.\n\n\n=== Cities ===\nThe list below only includes incorporated places of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Unincorporated census-designated places, places in Puerto Rico, and the five boroughs of New York City are all listed in separate tables below.\nThose cities that are not a part of a larger city's metropolitan area are in bold.\n\n\n=== Census-designated places ===\nThe following is a list of unincorporated census-designated places with population densities of over 10,000 people per square mile as of the 2010 U.S. Census. The rank column indicates the rank the place would have if census-designated places were included in the above table of incorporated places.\n\n\n=== New York City boroughs ===\nThe following lists the population densities of the five boroughs of New York City as of the 2020 U.S. Census. The rank column indicates the rank they would have if included in the above table of incorporated places. Staten Island has a population density below 10,000, but it is included for comparative purposes.\n\n\n=== Puerto Rico ===\n\nThe following lists the census-designated places in Puerto Rico that have a population density of over 10,000 people per square mile as of the 2000 U.S. Census. The census-designated places in Puerto Rico include zonas urbanas (urban areas) and comunidades (communities). The municipality, or mu\nThe states and territories included in the United States Census Bureau's statistics for the United States population, ethnicity, and most other categories include the 50 states and Washington, D.C. Separate statistics are maintained for the five permanently inhabited territories of the United States: Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands.\nAs of April 1, 2010, the date of the 2010 United States Census, the nine most populous U.S. states contain slightly more than half of the total population. The 25 least populous states contain less than one-sixth of the total population. California, the most populous state, contains more people than the 21 least populous states combined, and Wyoming, the least populous state, has a population less than any of the 31 most populous U.S. cities.\n\n\n== Method ==\nThe United States Census counts the persons residing in the United States including citizens, non-citizen permanent residents and non-citizen long-term visitors. Civilian and military federal employees serving abroad and their dependents are counted in their home state.\n\n\n== Electoral apportionment ==\nEvery 10 years, the U.S. Census Bureau is charged with making an actual count of all residents by state and territory.  The accuracy of this count is then tested after the fact, and sometimes statistically significant undercounts or overcounts occur.  For example, for the 2020 decennial census, 14 states had significant miscounts ranging from 1.5% to 6.6%.  While these adjustments may be reflected in government programs over the following decade, the 10-year representative apportionments discussed below are not changed to reflect the miscount.\n\n\n=== House of Representatives ===\nBased on this decennial census, each state is allocated a portion of the 435 fixed seats in the United States House of Representatives (until the early 20th century, the apportionment process generally increased the size of the House based on the results of the census until the size of the House was capped by the Reapportionment Act of 1929), with each state guaranteed at least one Representative. The allocation is based on each state's proportion of the combined population of the fifty states (not including the District of Columbia, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, or the United States Virgin Islands).\n\n\n=== Electoral College ===\nThe Electoral College, every four years, elects the President and Vice President of the United States based on the popular vote in each state and the District of Columbia. Each state's number of votes in the Electoral College is equal to its number of members in the Senate plus members in the House of Representatives.\nThe Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution additionally grants the District of Columbia (D.C.), which is not part of any state, as many Electoral College votes as it would have if it were a state, while having no more votes than the least populous state (currently, Wyoming). Since the U.S. Constitution guarantees every state at least one member of the U.S. House of Representatives and two members of the U.S. Senate, every state has at least three Electoral College votes. Thus, the Electoral College has 538 members (100 senators, plus 435 representatives due to the limit imposed by the Reapportionment Act of 1929, plus 3 members for the District of Columbia). Territories of the United States such as Puerto Rico are not included in the Electoral College: people in those territories cannot vote directly for the President of the United States, although they may participate in the partisan nominating primaries and caucuses.\n\n\n== State and territory rankings ==\n\n* — non-voting member of the House of Representatives.\n\n\n== Summary of population by region ==\n\nColumn header abbreviations: # = Rank, Geo. = Geographic\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nGeneral\n\"National Totals: Vintage 2015\".

For 1790 through 1990, tables are taken from the U.S Census Bureau's \"Population of the 100 Largest Cities and Other Urban Places in the United States: 1790 to 1990.\" For year 2000 rankings, data from the Census Bureau's tally of \"Cities with 100,000 or More Population Ranked by Selected Subject\" is used. The 2010 rankings are based on the 2010 census results.\nThe Census Bureau's definition of an \"urban place\" has included a variety of designations, including city, town, township, village, borough, and municipality. The top 10 urban areas in 1790 consisted of various places designated as cities, towns and townships. The top 10 urban areas in 2010 are all separate incorporated places.\nThis list generally refers only to the population of individual urban places within their defined limits at the time of the indicated census. Some of these places have since been annexed or merged into other cities. Other places may have expanded their borders due to such annexation or consolidation. For example, after the 1898 consolidation of New York City, the Census Bureau has defined all the boroughs within its city limits as one \"urban place\". Similarly, Philadelphia's population has included the census counts within both the former urban areas of Northern Liberties, Pennsylvania and Southwark, Pennsylvania ever since Philadelphia's 1854 consolidation.\n\n\n== 1790 ==\n\nWhen the United States declared independence in 1776, Philadelphia was its most populous city. By the time the first U.S. census count was completed in 1790, New York City had already grown to be 14% more populous than Philadelphia (though Philadelphia still had the larger metropolitan population in 1790). Note that, in 1790, New York City consisted of the entire island of Manhattan and that Philadelphia only included the most central neighborhoods of the city.\n\nThe total population of these 11 cities was 152,087.\n\n\n== 1800 ==\n\nRankings based on population data from the second United States Census.\n\nThe total population of these 10 cities was 216,346.\n\n\n== 1810 ==\n\nRankings based on population data from the third United States Census.\n\nThe total population of these 10 cities was 329,346.\n\n\n== 1820 ==\n\nRankings based on population data drawn the fourth United States Census.\n\nThe total population of these 10 cities was 405,869.

State by state, the highest number of Hispanic Americans could be found in California (15.6 million), Texas (11.4 million), Florida (5.7 million), New York state (4.0 million), and Puerto Rico (3.3 million). Meanwhile, the highest proportions of Hispanic Americans were in Puerto Rico (99.1%), New Mexico (47.8%), California (39.4%), Texas (39.4%), and Arizona (30.8%).\nThroughout the country, there are 343 cities with a population over 100,000. 48 of them had Hispanic majorities, and in 74 more cities, between 30% and 50% of the population identified as Hispanic. Out of the 48 majority-Hispanic cities, 27 were in California, 9 were in Texas, and 5 were in Puerto Rico. Florida and New Jersey had two each, while New Mexico, Nevada, Arizona, and Pennsylvania all had one.\nIn 2020, the largest cities which had a Hispanic majority were San Antonio, Texas (1,430,000), El Paso, Texas (679,000), Fresno, California (542,000), Miami, Florida (442,000), and Bakersfield, California (403,000).\n\n\n== List ==\nThe list below consists of each city (or city-equivalent) in the fifty states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico with a population over 100,000 and a Hispanic proportion over 30% as of the 2020 Census.

Such regions are not legally incorporated as a city or town would be and are not legal administrative divisions like counties or separate entities such as states. As a result, sometimes the precise definition of a given metropolitan area will vary between sources. The statistical criteria for a standard metropolitan area were defined in 1949 and redefined as a metropolitan statistical area in 1983.\nDue to suburbanization, the typical metropolitan area is polycentric rather than being centered around a large historic core city such as New York City or Chicago. Some metropolitan areas include more than one large historic core city; examples include the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, Virginia Beach–Norfolk–Newport News (Hampton Roads), Riverside–San Bernardino (Inland Empire), and Minneapolis–Saint Paul (Twin Cities). \nMSAs are defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which is part of the Executive Office of the President, and are used by the U.S. Census Bureau and other U.S. federal government agencies for statistical purposes.\n\n\n== Definitions ==\n\nThe U.S. Office of Management and Budget defines a set of core based statistical areas (CBSAs) throughout the country, which are composed of counties and county equivalents. \nCBSAs are delineated on the basis of a central contiguous area of relatively high population density, known as an urban area. The counties containing the core urban area are known as the \"central counties\" of the CBSA; these are defined as having at least 50% of their population living in urban areas of at least 10,000 in population. Additional surrounding counties, known as \"outlying counties\", can be included in the CBSA if these counties have strong social and economic ties to the central county or counties as measured by commuting and employment. Outlying counties are included in the CBSA if 25% of the workers living in the county work in the central county or counties, or if 25% of the employment in the county is held by workers who live in the central county or counties.\nAdjacent CBSAs are merged into a single CBSA when the central county or counties of one CBSA qualify as an outlying county or counties to the other CBSAs. One or more CBSAs may be grouped together or combined to form a larger statistical entity known as a combined statistical area (CSA) when the employment interchange measure (EIM) reaches 15% or more.\nCBSAs are subdivided into MSAs (formed around urban areas of at least 50,000 in population) and micropolitan statistical areas (μSAs), which are CBSAs built around an urban area of at least 10,000 in population but less than 50,000 in population. Some metropolitan areas may include multiple cities below 50,000 people, but combined have over 50,000 people. Previous terms that are no longer used to describe these regions include \"standard metropolitan statistical area\" (SMSA) and \"primary metropolitan statistical area\" (PMSA).\nOn January 19, 2021, OMB submitted a regulation for public comment that would increase the minimum population needed for an urban area population to be a metropolitan statistical area to be increased from 50,000 to 100,000. It ultimately decided to keep the minimum at 50,000 for the 2020 cycle.\nOn July 21, 2023, the Office of Management and Budget released revised delineations of the various CBSAs in the United States.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Census Bureau created the metropolitan district for the 1910 census as a standardized classification for large urban centers and their surrounding areas. The original threshold for a metropolitan district was 200,000, but was lowered to 100,000 in 1930 and 50,000 in 1940. The metropolitan districts were replaced by standard metropolitan areas (SMAs) in the 1950 census, which were defined by the Bureau of the Budget (now the Office of Management\nThis is a list of the 50 states, the 5 territories, and the District of Columbia by population density, population size, and land area. It also includes a sortable table of density by states, territories, divisions, and regions by population rank and land area, and a sortable table for density by states, divisions, regions, and territories in square miles and square kilometers.\nThe population density of the United States is lower than that of many other countries because of the United States' large land area. There are large, sparsely populated areas in parts of the US, like the east-to-west stretch extending from the outskirts of Seattle all the way to Minneapolis, or the north-to-south portion from northern Montana to southern New Mexico, excluding Denver and Albuquerque. For comparison, the population density of the U.S. is 1/15 that of South Korea and 1/12 that of India and the Netherlands.

Data are from the US Census unless otherwise specified. Population data are for the year 2023 and area data are for the year 2010.

A portion of it, the Honolulu District, is sometimes regarded as the \"city\" for statistical purposes, although it has no government separate from that of the City and County as a whole. The U.S. Census Bureau defines Honolulu CDP (census-designated place) to coincide with the Honolulu District. Thus for Hawaii, the largest CDPs are ranked, as of the 2020 United States census.\nNote 2: The 4 municipalities of the Northern Mariana Islands are listed. Each municipality is divided into smaller villages, but the municipalities are considered the primary subdivisions (as in how Saipan is usually listed as the capital rather than Capitol Hill, Saipan). The five largest villages are Garapan (3,983), Dandan (3,280), Koblerville (2,493), Finasisu (2,491) and Kagman III (2,402), with Capitol Hill being the 19th largest village at 1,028 people.\nNote 3: The most populous sub-districts of the U.S. Virgin Islands (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) are listed.

The number of murders includes nonnegligent manslaughter. This list is based on the reporting. In most cases, the city and the reporting agency are identical. However, in some cases such as Charlotte, Honolulu, and Las Vegas, the reporting agency has more than one municipality.\nMurder is the only statistic that all agencies are required to report. Consequently, some agencies do not report all the crimes. If components are missing the total is adjusted to 0.\n\n\n== Note about population ==\nOften, one obtains very different results depending on whether crime rates are measured for the city jurisdiction or the metropolitan area.\nInformation is voluntarily submitted by each jurisdiction and some jurisdictions do not appear in the table because they either did not submit data or they did not meet deadlines.\nThe FBI website has this disclaimer on population estimates:\n\nFor the 2019 population estimates used in this table, the FBI computed individual rates of growth from one year to the next for every city/town and county using 2010 decennial population counts and 2011 through 2018 population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau. Each agency’s rates of growth were averaged; that average was then applied and added to its 2018 Census population estimate to derive the agency’s 2019 population estimate.\n\n\n== Crime rates ==\n\nNotes:\n1 The figures are shown in this column for the offense of rape were reported using only the revised Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) definition of rape. See the data declaration for further explanation. \n2 The FBI does not publish arson data unless it receives it from either the agency or the state for all 12 months of the calendar year. \n3 The population of the city of Mobile, Alabama, includes 55,819 inhabitants from the jurisdiction of the Mobile County Sheriff's Department. \n4 Because of changes in the state/ or local agency's reporting practices, figures are not comparable to previous years' data. \n5 The FBI determined that the agency's data were underreported. Consequently, those data are not included in this table. \n6 Arson offenses are also reported by the Louisville Fire Department. Those figures are not included in this table. \n7 Arson offenses are reported by the Toledo Fire Department; therefore, those figures are not included in this report. \n8 This agency/state submits rape data classified according to the legacy UCR definition; therefore, the rape offense and violent crime total, which rape is a part of, is not included in this table. See the data declaration for further explanation.\n\n\n== Criticism of ranking crime data ==\nThe FBI web site recommends against using its data for ranking because these rankings lead to simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that often create misleading perceptions adversely affecting cities and counties, along with their residents. The FBI web site also recommends against using its data to judge how effective law enforcement agencies are, since there are many factors other than law enforcement  that influence crime rates.\nIn November 2007, the executive board of the American Society of Criminology (ASC) went further than the FBI itself, and approved a resolution opposing not only the use of the ratings to judge police departments, but also any development of city crime rankings from FBI Uniform Crime Reports (UCRs) at all. The resolution opposed these rankings on the grounds that they \"fail to account for the many conditions affecting crime rates\" and \"divert attention from the individual and community characteristics that elevate crime in all cities\", though it did not provide sources or further elaborate on these claims. The resolution states the rankings \"r\nThere are 3,244 counties and county equivalents in the United States. The 50 states of the United States are divided into 3,007 political subdivisions of states called counties. Two hundred thirty-seven other local governments and geographic places are also first-order administrative divisions of their respective state/district/territory, but are not called counties. The  United States Census Bureau refers to the latter as county equivalents. The 237 county equivalents include the District of Columbia and 100 equivalents in U.S. territories (such as those in Puerto Rico). The large majority of counties and equivalents were organized by 1970. Since that time, most creations, boundary changes and dissolutions have occurred in Alaska, Virginia, and Connecticut.\nAmong the 50 states, 44 are partitioned entirely into counties, with no county equivalents. Louisiana is instead divided into 64 equivalent parishes, while Alaska is divided into 19 equivalent boroughs and 11 sparsely populated census areas, the latter also known collectively as the unorganized borough. Virginia is composed of a mixture of 95 counties and 38 independent cities. Maryland, Missouri and Nevada are each composed entirely of counties, except that each also has exactly one independent city: Baltimore, St. Louis, and Carson City, respectively. The District of Columbia is a single federal district that is not part of any state or county. All of the above 136 exceptional cases are reckoned as county equivalents. The number of counties (or equivalents) per state ranges from the three counties of Delaware, to the 254 counties of Texas. In New England, where the town model predominates, several counties have no corresponding local governments, existing only as historical, legal, and census boundaries, such as the counties of Rhode Island, as well as eight of Massachusetts' 14 counties. On June 6, 2022, the U.S. Census Bureau formally recognized Connecticut's nine councils of government as county equivalents instead of the state's eight counties. Connecticut's eight historical counties continue to exist in name only, and are no longer considered for statistical purposes. In total, the 50 states consist of 3,144 counties and equivalents. \nSimilarly, the Census Bureau treats 100 subdivisions of the territories of the United States as county equivalents. These are the 78 municipalities of Puerto Rico, the three major islands of the U.S. Virgin Islands, the three districts and two atolls of American Samoa, Guam as a single island and county equivalent, the four municipalities of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the nine island territories of the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands.

State by state, the highest number of black Americans could be found in Texas (3.96 million), Florida (3.70 million), Georgia (3.54 million), New York (3.53 million), and California (2.83 million). Meanwhile, the highest proportions of African Americans were in the District of Columbia (44.17%), Mississippi (37.94%), Louisiana (33.13%), Georgia (33.03%), and Maryland (32.01%).\nThroughout the country, there are 342 cities with a population over 100,000. 19 of them had black (alone or in combination) majorities, and in 46 more cities, between 30% and 50% of the population identified as black. Out of the 19 majority-black cities, four were in Georgia and Louisiana and Alabama had three each. Meanwhile, the states of Florida, Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey, Texas, Virginia, Tennessee, Massachusetts, Maryland, and Mississippi each had one majority-black city.\nIn 2020, the largest cities which had a black majority were Detroit, Michigan (population 639K), Memphis, Tennessee (population 633K), Baltimore, Maryland (population 586K), New Orleans, Louisiana (population 384K), and Cleveland, Ohio (population 373K).\n\n\n== List ==\nThe list below displays each city (or city-equivalent) in the fifty states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico with a population over 100,000 and a Black proportion over 30% as of the 2020 Census.

An urban area is defined by the Census Bureau as a contiguous set of census blocks that are \"densely developed residential, commercial, and other nonresidential areas\". \nUrban areas consist of a densely-settled urban core, plus surrounding developed areas that meet certain density criteria. Since urban areas are composed of census blocks and not cities, counties, or county-equivalents, urban area boundaries may consist of partial areas of these political units. Urban areas are distinguished from rural areas: any area not part of an urban area is considered to be rural by the Census Bureau. The list in this article includes urban areas with a population of at least 50,000, but urban areas may have as few as 5,000 residents or 2,000 housing units. Some cities may also be a part of two or more urban areas, as is the case for Huntsville, and the smaller Huntsville Southeast.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nFor the 2020 census, the Census Bureau redefined the classification of urban areas. The criteria were finalized on March 24, 2022, after a period of public input, and the final results of delineation were published on December 29, 2022. Key changes for the 2020 criteria included:\n\nThe removal of the distinction between urbanized areas and urban clusters. Urbanized areas were previously defined as urban areas with at least 50,000 residents, and urban clusters were urban areas with less than 50,000. All qualifying areas are now designated as urban areas.\nThe use of housing unit density as an alternative minimum for inclusion: either 2,000 housing units or a population of 5,000 may qualify an area as an urban area.

Cities may be defined as the cities proper, the extent of their urban area, or their metropolitan regions.\n\n\n== Definitions ==\n\n\n=== City proper (administrative) ===\n\nA city can be defined by its administrative boundaries, otherwise known as city proper. UNICEF defines city proper as, \"the population living within the administrative boundaries of a city or controlled directly from the city by a single authority.\" A city proper is a locality defined according to legal or political boundaries and an administratively recognised urban status that is usually characterised by some form of local government. Cities proper and their boundaries and population data may not include suburbs.\nThe use of city proper as defined by administrative boundaries may not include suburban areas where an important proportion of the population working or studying in the city lives. Because of this definition, the city proper population figure may differ greatly from the urban area population figure, as many cities are amalgamations of smaller municipalities (Australia), and conversely, many Chinese cities govern territories that extend well beyond the core urban area into suburban and rural areas. The Chinese municipality of Chongqing, which is the largest city proper in the world by population, comprises a huge administrative area of 82,403 km2, around the size of Austria. However, more than 70% of its 30-million population are agricultural workers living in a rural setting.\n\n\n=== Urban area ===\n\nA city can be defined as a conditionally contiguous urban area, without regard to territorial or other boundaries inside an urban area. UNICEF defines urban area as follows:\n\nThe definition of \"urban\" varies from country to country, and, with periodic reclassification, can also vary within one country over time, making direct comparisons difficult. An urban area can be defined by one or more of the following: administrative criteria or political boundaries (e.g., area within the jurisdiction of a municipality or town committee), a threshold population size (where the minimum for an urban settlement is typically in the region of 2,000 people, although this varies globally between 200 and 50,000), population density, economic function (e.g., where a significant majority of the population is not primarily engaged in agriculture, or where there is surplus employment) or the presence of urban characteristics (e.g., paved streets, electric lighting, sewerage).\nAccording to Demographia, an urban area is a continuously built up land mass of urban development that is within a labor market (metropolitan area or metropolitan region) and contains no rural land.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\n\nA city can be defined by the inhabitants of its demographic population, as by metropolitan area, or labour market area. UNICEF defines metropolitan area as follows:\n\nA formal local government area comprising the urban area as a whole and its primary commuter areas, typically formed around a city with a large concentration of people (i.e., a population of at least 100,000). In addition to the city proper, a metropolitan area includes both the surrounding territory with urban levels of residential density and some additional lower-density areas that are adjacent to and linked to the city (e.g., through frequent transport, road linkages or commuting facilities).\nIn many countries, metropolitan areas are established either with an official organisation or only for statistical purposes. In the United States, metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In the Philippines, metropolitan areas have an official agency, such as Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), which manages Manila metropolitan area. Similar agencies exist in Indonesia, such as Jabodetabekjur Development Cooperati",

It is part of the Mid-Cities region of the Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington metropolitan statistical area, and is a principal city of the metropolis and region. The city had a population of 394,266 in 2020, making it the second-largest city in the county after Fort Worth and the third-largest city in the metropolitan area, after Dallas and Fort Worth. Arlington is the 50th-most populous city in the United States, the seventh-most populous city in the state of Texas, and the largest city in the state that is not a county seat.\nArlington is home to the University of Texas at Arlington, a major urban research university, the Arlington Assembly plant used by General Motors, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Region IV, Texas Health Resources, Mensa International, and D. R. Horton. Additionally, Arlington hosts the Texas Rangers at Globe Life Field, the Dallas Cowboys at AT&T Stadium, the Arlington Renegades at Choctaw Stadium, the Dallas Wings at College Park Center, the International Bowling Campus (which houses the United States Bowling Congress, International Bowling Museum and the International Bowling Hall of Fame), and the theme parks Six Flags Over Texas (the original Six Flags) and Hurricane Harbor.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nEuropean settlement in the Arlington area dates back at least to the 1840s. After the May 24, 1841 battle between Texas General Edward H. Tarrant and Native Americans of the Village Creek settlement, a trading post was established at Marrow Bone Spring in present-day Arlington (historical marker at 32°42.136′N 97°6.772′W). The rich soil of the area attracted farmers, and several agriculture-related businesses were well established by the late nineteenth century.\nArlington was founded in 1876 along the Texas and Pacific Railway. Named after General Robert E. Lee's Arlington House in Arlington County, Virginia., Arlington grew as a cotton-ginning and farming center, and incorporated on April 21, 1884. The city could boast of water, electricity, natural gas, and telephone services by 1910, along with a public school system.\n\nFrom 1892 until 1951, a mineral well drilled exactly in the middle of downtown Arlington, Texas, was a key reason to visit the town. The water was part of the city's brand, also serving as a meeting point for everything from prohibition to the right of women to vote. The well has been paved over.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, life in Arlington was bustling with controversy and entertainment. In the early 1920s, a tea room known as \"Top O' Hill Terrace\" opened up along the now-defunct Bankhead Highway to serve dinner and tea to guests traveling through Dallas and Fort Worth. Ownership changed in the late 1920s and shortly thereafter the facilities were secretly converted into casinos and a speakeasy. Known by historians as \"Vegas before Vegas\", escape tunnels and secret rooms were constructed to hide the illegal gambling during police raids. However, the restaurant portion of the facility still existed as a legitimate business and a front.\n\nBy 1925 the city's population was estimated at 3,031—well under the population of Dallas and Fort Worth at the time. In 1929, a horse-racing track called Arlington Downs was constructed by W.T. Waggoner and Brian Nyantika close by to the speakeasy. Gambling was still illegal, but people were making bets regardless. Waggoner and his sons campaigned to make parimutuel betting legal, and in 1933 the state issued its first legal gambling permit to Arlington Downs. The track was immensely profitable at that point, making a daily average of $113,000 before inflation with a daily attendance average of 6,700 people. At the end of the 1937 season, the state legislature repealed their parimutuel gambling laws, and the Downs were sold to commercial developers.\nIn the 1940s, the Arlington Downs was used as a rodeo and event venue. Top O' Hill Terrace evaded the police until 1947, when famous Texas Ranger M. T. \"Lone Wolf\"\nThe University of Texas at Arlington (UTA or UT Arlington) is a public research university in Arlington, Texas. The university was founded in 1895 and was in the Texas A&M University System for several decades until joining the University of Texas System in 1965.\nThe university is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\". The fall 2022 campus enrollment consisted of 40,990 students making it the second largest university in North Texas and fifth-largest in Texas. UT Arlington is the third-largest producer of college graduates in Texas and offers over 180 baccalaureate, masters, and doctoral degree programs.\nUT Arlington participates in 15 intercollegiate sports as a Division I member of the NCAA and Western Athletic Conference. UTA sports teams have been known as the Mavericks since 1971.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Establishment (1895–1916) ===\n\nThe university traces its roots back to the opening of Arlington College in September 1895. Arlington College was established as a private school for primary through secondary level students, equivalent to the modern 1st to 10th grades. At the time, the public school system in the city of Arlington was underfunded and understaffed. Local merchant Edward Emmett Rankin organized fellow citizens of the city to donate materials and land to build a schoolhouse where the modern campus is now located.\nRankin also convinced the two co-principals of the public school in Arlington, Lee Morgan Hammond and William Marshall Trimble, to invest in and hold the same positions at Arlington College. In the first few years, between 75 and 150 students were enrolled in the college. The public school began to rent space at Arlington College, and was eventually sold to the city in 1900. The public school building became so unsafe that all of the space in Arlington College was rented for the 1901–1902 school year until the creation of the Arlington Independent School District in 1902. Although the public education system was set to improve, Arlington College was closed and the property was sold to James McCoy Carlisle.\n\nCarlisle was already established as a respected educator in the North Texas region, and he opened the Carlisle Military Academy in the fall of 1902. His program consisted of a balance between course work and military training. Enrollment increased to 150 students by 1905, and he began a large expansion of the campus. Baseball, football, basketball, and track teams were begun between 1904 and 1908. Around the same time, new barracks, a track, a gymnasium, and an indoor pool were built. The academy became known as one of the best at its level in the country. Unfortunately, enrollment did not continue to increase with the expansion in facilities and Carlisle ran into serious financial problems.\n\nLawsuits for the mortgages on the property were filed in 1911, and Carlisle Military Academy was closed in 1913. In the fall of 1913, Henry Kirby Taylor moved from Missouri, where he was president of the Northwest State Teachers' College, to set up another military academy called Arlington Training School. He also was required to manage the finances and campus for the property owners. By the 1914–1915 school year, the campus contained 11 buildings on 10 acres (40,000 m2) of land with 95 students enrolled. The school was incorporated in 1915 in order to raise funds to make improvements to the existing buildings, but more financial problems arose and another series of lawsuits were filed. Taylor left Arlington, and the property owners hired John B. Dodson to establish a third military academy for the 1916–1917 school year called Arlington Military Academy. Enrollment was apparently very low, and Arlington Military Academy closed after one year.\n\n\n=== Texas A&M University System (1917–1965) ===\n\nSince the turn of the 20th century, the prospects for turning the campus into a public, junior vocational college had been discussed. By 1917, the Agricultural and Mechanical College of \nThis is a list of Texas–Arlington Mavericks football players in the NFL Draft.\n\n\n== Key ==\n\n\n== Selections ==\nSource:\n\n\n== References ==\nArlington Stadium was a baseball stadium located in Arlington, Texas, United States, located between Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas. It served as the home for the Texas Rangers (MLB) from 1972 until 1993, after which the team moved into The Ballpark in Arlington (now Choctaw Stadium).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years as a minor league stadium ===\nThe stadium was built in 1965 as Turnpike Stadium, a minor league ballpark seating 10,000 people named for the nearby Dallas–Fort Worth Turnpike (now part of Interstate 30, and known as the Tom Landry Highway). The Fort Worth Cats of the Texas League moved there as the Dallas–Fort Worth Spurs, and played there for the next seven years, setting many Texas League attendance records during their tenure at the stadium, especially after it expanded to 20,500 seats in 1970.\nHowever, the stadium's real purpose was to attract a major league team to the Metroplex. It had been built to be upgraded to Major League standards of the era, and was designed to be expandable to up to 50,000 seats (although its final actual capacity was 7,000 seats below that). Due to its location in a natural bowl, only minimal excavations (such as connecting dugouts directly to the clubhouses) would be necessary for it to be ready for a big-league team. Although it was built primarily with baseball in mind, its general shape was very similar to the major league multi-purpose stadiums that were beginning to emerge in the mid-1960s. In fact, the stadium was designed to accommodate football, but the Dallas Cowboys were never interested in playing in the stadium. The Metroplex had been mentioned as a possible expansion site since the 1950s, and Arlington Mayor Tom Vandergriff figured that Arlington, halfway between the two cities, would be the best site for a prospective major league team.\n\n\n=== 1970s–1980s ===\n\nIn 1971, the struggling second incarnation of the Washington Senators announced their intentions to move to the Metroplex under the banner of the Texas Rangers. The stadium was expanded to seat over 35,700 people, and was renamed Arlington Stadium. The stadium played host to its first major league game on April 21, 1972, when the Rangers inaugurated the stadium by defeating the California Angels, 7–6; MLB's first-ever strike had disrupted the start of the 1972 season, hence the later than anticipated opening day.\nArlington Stadium had no roof, and thus virtually no protection from the oppressive Texas heat. For nearly all of its existence, it was the hottest stadium in the majors. It was not unusual for game-time temperatures to be well above 100 °F (38 °C). Combined with the Rangers' mediocre performance, this held down attendance considerably during the 1970s. Due in part to the heat, the Rangers scheduled nearly all of their games from May through September at night to get around it. Other than nearby amusement park Six Flags Over Texas, there was no neighborhood around the park. In his book Storied Stadiums, Curt Smith described it as \"small, (but) not intimate\".\nThe scoreboard in the Rangers' early days was a long, horizontal rectangle with a panel shaped like the state of Texas. It was replaced after the 1984 season with a new scoreboard and series of billboards that ran from both foul poles. \"Cotton-Eyed Joe\" was played during the seventh-inning stretch for fans to dance to instead of \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\". Arlington Stadium was also the first major league ballpark to sell nachos (in 1974).\n\n\n=== 1990s ===\n\nThe stadium eventually began to show its age and inadequacy, and the City of Arlington approved the construction of a new stadium for the Rangers. The last game was played in Arlington Stadium on October 3, 1993, resulting in a 4–1 win by the visiting Kansas City Royals, witnessed by 41,039 fans (it was also the final game in the career of Hall-of-Famer George Brett, who recorded the last hit in the stadium with a ninth-inning single). Following the 1993 season, the Rangers moved to The Ballpark \nThe UT Arlington Mavericks (abbreviated UT Arlington, UTA, and Mavs) are the athletic teams that represent the University of Texas at Arlington in Arlington, Texas. The Mavericks currently compete in the NCAA Division I Western Athletic Conference in 15 varsity sports. The number rose to 15 in the fall of 2017 women's golf began their first season of competition that athletic season.\nJon Fagg is the current athletic director. Prior to his stint at UTA, he was a Deputy Athletics Director, overseeing daily administration and NCAA compliance for the Arkansas Razorbacks at the University of Arkansas. Fagg replaced Jim Baker, who led the Athletic Department from 2012 to 2022.\n\n\n== General history ==\n\nUTA was a founding member of the Southland Conference in 1963 and participated in the league until the end of the 2011–12 athletic year. They joined the Western Athletic Conference for one year before they moved to the Sun Belt Conference. They left the Sun Belt and rejoined the WAC on July 1, 2022.\nUT Arlington won the Southland Conference's Commissioners Cup three times since the award was first instituted in 1998. The Commissioner's Cup is awarded to the athletics program with the highest all-around performance in all conference events, including all men's and women's events. The Athletic Department finished within two points of the Bubas Cup, the Sun Belt's all-sports championship trophy, twice in 2014-15 and 2016–17, as well as a second-place finish in 2018–19.\nWhen the school transitioned from junior college to University status in 1959, the schools athletic teams were known as the Rebels. Controversy would surround the name after a decades time. A series of events would occur that lead to a change in mascots to the current version. The Mavericks' name selection was made in 1971, predating the National Basketball Association's expansion franchise Dallas Mavericks' starting choice in 1980.\nThe first women's programs began competition in the 1973–74 school year. Volleyball, basketball and softball were the first three programs, competing in the AIAW until the teams moved under the umbrella of the NCAA in 1982–83.\n\n\n== Sports sponsored ==\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\n\n\n==== Men's basketball ====\n\nHome games are played at College Park Center, located on University of Texas at Arlington's campus in Arlington. The team appeared in the 2008 NCAA tournament, losing against the No. 1 seed Memphis in the first round. Later, Memphis had to forfeit their win for \"ineligible competition, impermissible benefits and failure to monitor its athletics programs.\"\nOn November 29, 2016, the Mavericks defeated the Texas Longhorns in Austin for the first time in program history after 11 attempts. The Longhorns decided to terminate their contract with them after their 2016 loss due to the Mavericks becoming too competitive. The terminated contract paid the Mavericks a large lump sum for each game played in Austin for six consecutive years (2011-2016).\nAlthough only 22 of 65 University seasons have resulted in an overall winning record, 13 of the past 22 seasons have finished with a .500 winning percentage or greater, including a school record 27 wins in the 2016–17 season (as of the conclusion of the 2022–23 season). They won the Southland Conference regular season championship in 2012, along with a tie for the 2004 regular season championship and a 2008 conference tournament championship that led to their first NCAA Tournament appearance. The first Sun Belt regular season title was earned in the record-setting year of 2016–2017.\nOverall, the team has played in six postseason tournaments and won four conference championships.\n\n\n==== Women's basketball ====\n\nThe women's basketball team was established in 1973 and experienced early success with a combined 64–32 record in three seasons between 1975 and 1977.

The venue opened in April 1994 as a baseball stadium with the name The Ballpark in Arlington, serving as the home for the Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball from 1994 through 2019. It replaced the nearby Arlington Stadium, and was succeeded by Globe Life Field. \nIn 2020, the stadium was retrofitted for football and soccer. It is the current home of the North Texas SC of MLS Next Pro (FC Dallas's reserve team), and the Arlington Renegades of the UFL.\nOn August 25, 2021, Choctaw Casinos & Resorts bought the naming rights to the stadium.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn April 1989, Rangers owner Eddie Chiles sold the team to an investment group headed by George W. Bush. The aging Arlington Stadium was outdated and did not have amenities that helped make other baseball franchises more profitable. As a result, the team could not compete with other big-city teams for good players. In an effort to fund the project through public money instead of private financing, the Rangers threatened to leave Arlington. The city of Arlington spent $150,000 on an advertising campaign to persuade voters to approve the funding through a referendum by printing brochures, placing telemarketing calls, and planning a \"Hands Around Arlington Day.\" On January 19, 1991, over 65% of voters approved the deal, allowing the city government to cover 71% of the costs ($135 million out of $191 million) of building the new ballpark. The deal called for the city to raise the sales tax by half a cent to go toward construction. Both houses of the Texas Legislature unanimously approved the public purpose of the ballpark, and Texas Governor Ann Richards signed it all into law.\nAs part of the deal, the city created a separate corporation, the Arlington Sports Facilities Development Authority (ASFDA), to manage construction. Using authority granted to it by the city, the ASFDA seized several tracts of land around the stadium site using eminent domain for parking and future development.\nConstruction on the stadium, which was dubbed The Ballpark in Arlington, began on April 2, 1992, a short distance away from Arlington Stadium, the stadium it would replace, and the new Ballpark in Arlington opened on April 1, 1994, in an exhibition contest between the Rangers and the New York Mets. The first official game was on April 11 against the Milwaukee Brewers.\nAmeriquest bought the naming rights to the ballpark on May 7, 2004, and renamed it Ameriquest Field in Arlington. The Rangers severed their relationship with Ameriquest on March 19, 2007, and announced the park would be renamed Rangers Ballpark in Arlington.\nThe largest crowd to watch a Rangers baseball game was on October 30, 2010, when 52,419 fans watched Game 3 of the 2010 World Series against the San Francisco Giants.\nGlobe Life and Accident Insurance Company, a subsidiary of McKinney-based Globe Life, bought the naming rights for the facility on February 5, 2014, naming it Globe Life Park in Arlington.\nOn May 20, 2016, the Rangers announced that they intended to move from Globe Life Park to the new Globe Life Field, beginning with the 2020 season. The new air conditioned stadium was slated to feature a retractable roof, which many argued could increase stadium revenue from those who would otherwise not want to sit in the heat during games as the season progresses throughout the hot Texas summer, in particular those that occur in the afternoon. Voting for the new ballpark began on November 8 (the same day as the 2016 presidential election) for residents in the city limits of Arlington. The ballpark was passed with a 60% favorable vote. The stadium opened in the 2020 season.\n\nThe new stadium was built south of Globe Life Park, on the site of a surface parking lot between Randol Mill Road and Cowboys Way. Space between the new stadium and Globe Life Park was constructed into an entertainment complex called Texas Live!, d\nArlington High School (AHS), located in Arlington, Texas, United States, is a secondary school serving grades 9-12.

Sam Houston High School opens in fall 1963.\nSam Houston, AISD's second high school, opened in the eastern part of Arlington in the Fall of 1963. The original boundary between Houston and Arlington High School was described by Cathy Brown of The Dallas Morning News as \"a north/south zig zag.\" The boundary extended from a point near the intersection of Cooper at Mansfield northward to Arkansas Lane. From there, it extended east to Johnson Creek and then ran alongside the creek to Collins. After Collins the boundary traveled northward to the Arlington city limits.\nIn 1965, AISD desegregated, so Arlington High School desegregated.\n\n1968: Ousley campus is sold to The University of Texas at Arlington; junior high relocated to Bailey Junior High on Bowen Rd.\nIn 1970, Lamar High School opened, relieving some of the overcrowding at Arlington and Sam Houston. Cathy Brown of The Dallas Morning News said that \"[t]he effect on Arlington High School was huge\" since the housing in the Arlington zone north to division had been moved to Lamar. 12th grade students that had been zoned out of Arlington High School continued to attend Arlington High School, despite being in the Lamar zone, so the class of 1971 had almost 1,000 students. Each subsequent class size was smaller.\n\n1972: Principal James Crouch introduces slogan, “How Sweet It Is To Be In Colt Country.” at an outdoor pep rally.\n1977: Logo with sideways horseshoe representing the “C” in Colts used for first time.\nMartin High School opened in 1982.

Consisting of former Deep Purple singer Rod Evans, former Johnny Winter drummer Bobby Caldwell, former Iron Butterfly guitarist Larry Reinhardt and former Iron Butterfly bassist Lee Dorman, the band had an eclectic style bridging elements of hard rock, progressive rock and jazz fusion with space rock. They released three albums between 1972 and 1977. \nThe band was plagued from its inception with significant problems, including lawsuits involving Evans, Reinhardt and Dorman with their former bands, and a dispute over musical style with their record label, Capricorn Records. Although the band performed well together, relationships among the various band members were strained. In particular, singer Rod Evans left and rejoined the band several times beginning in 1971, and made his departure permanent in late 1973, after the release of the band's second album.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe original line-up for Captain Beyond included former Deep Purple singer Rod Evans, former Johnny Winter drummer Bobby Caldwell, former Iron Butterfly guitarist Larry \"Rhino\" Reinhardt and former Iron Butterfly bassist Lee Dorman alongside keyboardist Lewie Gold. Gold left for personal reasons before the first album was recorded. The remaining line-up recorded the self-titled debut album, released in 1972 by Capricorn Records, a Macon, Georgia-based independent label primarily known for cultivating such Southern rock groups as The Allman Brothers Band and Wet Willie.\nFollowing that album, Caldwell left the band to join Derringer and was replaced by Brian Glascock. Also joining the band around that time were keyboardist Reese Wynans and conguero Guille Garcia. The record company's chosen producer, Giorgio Gomelsky, did not like Glascock's drumming and requested a new drummer. Glascock was released and Marty Rodriguez was brought in on drums on the recommendation of Garcia. This six-man lineup recorded the group's second album, Sufficiently Breathless, with producer and Capricorn Records co-founder Phil Walden. Tension during the recording led to Evans quitting, and the band splitting consequently. The original lineup with Caldwell reformed later in 1973 for gigs in the US and Canada. However, Evans left the band permanently around Christmas of 1973 and the band broke up.\nThe band reformed in 1976 with Caldwell, Dorman, and Rhino, being joined first by Jason Cahoon and later with Willy Daffern as vocalist. They recorded the band's third album Dawn Explosion on Warner Bros., but broke up in 1978.\nCaldwell and Rhino reformed Captain Beyond in 1998, with Jimi Interval on vocals, Dan Frye on keyboards, and Jeff Artabasy on bass. In 1999, Swedish record label Record Heaven released a tribute to Captain Beyond entitled Thousand Days of Yesterday. The album features fellow 1970s rockers Pentagram playing \"Dancing Madly Backwards\". In 2000 they released a four track EP entitled Night Train Calling. Shortly thereafter they were joined briefly by guitarist Steve Petrey.\nCaptain Beyond once again disbanded in 2003 when lead guitarist Larry Reinhardt developed cancer. Following treatment, Reinhardt continued to perform music until late 2011, when he again fell ill. He died on January 2, 2012. Bassist Lee Dorman died on December 21, 2012. Rod Evans has retired from performing, partly due to legal troubles with his original Deep Purple bandmates, and his current residence is still unknown. However, Caldwell mentioned in a 2015 interview that Evans was doing just fine and was working in the field of respiratory therapy.\nCaldwell resurrected the band in 2013, with a lineup consisting of Don Bonzi, Jeff \"Boday\" Christensen, and Jamie Holka, bassist Allen Carmen, and guitarist/keyboardist/vocalist Simon Lind. In 2015 Carmen and Christensen departed the band and Artabasy returned as bassist. The reformed group began touring in 2015.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Members ===\n\n\n=== Lineups ===\n\n\n=== Timeline =\nJames W. Martin High School is a secondary school for grades 9 to 12 in Arlington, Texas, United States. It is part of the Arlington Independent School District. The school's colors are red, black and silver.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe school opened in 1982. As a result, the former James Bowie High School closed in 1983. The relative proximity of Bowie to Sam Houston High School was a factor as was the shifting demographics and resulting graduation class sizes that necessitated the new school and the transition of Bowie to Workman Junior High School. Cathy Brown of The Dallas Morning News wrote that Sam Houston High School and Lamar High School were \"relatively unaffected\" by the opening of Martin, located in southwest Arlington. She explained that the attendance zone of Arlington High School lost substantial area that included a significant number of new residences in the more affluent Southwest part of the city adjacent to Lake Arlington.\nMartin High School is one of only two high schools in the district not named for a historical figure in Texas. The trustees broke with the Arlington tradition of naming high schools in this manner when naming the school in its planning in the earlier 1980s. Only Martin High School and Arlington High School, the town's first high school, are exceptions. AISD trustees chose to honor James W. Martin, superintendent of schools from 1955 to 1976, who oversaw the integration (racial desegregation) of Arlington schools in 1965, which occurred without the violence or hysterics that had occurred frequently nationwide, and notably in nearby Mansfield. This was not shared at the time of the school's opening, however.\nThe school opened with grades 10 to 12 and grew to become the city's largest high school within a decade. Construction in 1996-1997 expanded the size of the campus considerably to make room for the addition of freshmen in the 1997–1998 school year.\nIn 2015, the AISD STEM Academy began classes at Martin. The Academy provides advanced classes in engineering, biology/biomedical science, computer science, and math/science to students in 9th-12th grade. STEM students can also take classes at the University of Texas at Arlington while they are enrolled in high school. The program is free, but spots are limited.  \nIn July 2020, Principal Marlene Roddy announced the discontinuation of the native American mascot at the school, saying the reason was \"...to adapt the school to modern standards of cultural sensitivity\", which has been a contentious topic in many communities and in professional sports, notably the NFL's Washington (former) Redskins and the Cleveland Indians major league baseball team. The change was met with opposition, primarily from alumni, but it was implemented. The Warrior would remain in writing, but the modern definition of the term is being embraced and will no longer refer to the Native American iconography, specifically the war bonnet and mascot. The school's \"rocking M\" became its primary graphic. The \"Native American tribal chieftain hat\" logo had been in use at the school since its opening in 1982, having been illustrated by one of its students. The war bonnet was formed by shaping the letters comprising \"Warriors\" and the face was in the same manner using the letters MHS, both in red, forming a Native American chief in profile. Similar changes occurred later at nearby South Grand Prairie High School, which coincidentally are known at the Warriors.\n\n\n== Feeder patterns ==\nCorey, Moore and Wood Elementary Schools feed into Boles Jr. High.

It is the first amusement park in the Six Flags chain, and features themed areas and attractions. The park opened on August 5, 1961, after a year of construction and an initial investment of US$10 million by real estate developer Angus G. Wynne Jr.\nThe park is managed by the Six Flags Entertainment Corp., which owns a 54% interest of the Texas Limited Partnership that owns the park. Six Flags Over Texas Fund, Ltd., a private-equity and asset-management firm, headed by Dallas businessman Jack Knox, bought the park in 1969. Over the years, the various companies that managed the park exercised options to purchase interest in the fund. Six Flags Entertainment has an option to purchase the remaining 46% in 2028. In 1991, Time Warner Entertainment began managing park operations. In 1998, Time Warner sold its interests in the Six Flags parks to Premier Parks, of Oklahoma City, which later changed its name to Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAfter a visit to Disneyland in Anaheim, California, shortly after its opening, a wealthy real estate developer, Angus G. Wynne Jr., concluded that his home state, Texas, should have a similar park. Planning for such a place began in 1959, under the leadership of Wynne and the Great Southwest Corporation, along with the backing of various New York City investors. Construction of the park began in August 1960.\nThe name \"Six Flags Over Texas\" refers to the flags of the six nations that have governed Texas: Spain, France, Mexico, the Republic of Texas, the United States of America, and the Confederate States of America. Wynne originally intended to name the park \"Texas Under Six Flags\". Various legends have attributed the name change to his wife, Joann; to the Daughters of the Republic of Texas, of which his wife may have been a member; and to his entertainment director, Charles Meeker, who is said to have stated \"Texas isn't 'under' anything.\" The original park was divided into six themed areas for each of the six entities that had ruled Texas. Other themed areas have since been added.\nSix Flags Over Texas opened its gates from July 29 to August 4, 1961, to several local corporations that Wynne had invited as part of a \"soft-test opening\". The park held its grand-opening ceremonies on Saturday, August 5, 1961. Dignitaries included the mayors of Arlington, Dallas, Fort Worth, Grand Prairie, and Irving. Park attendance reached 8,374. Admission cost $2.75 (equivalent to $28 in 2023) for adults and $2.25 (equivalent to $23 in 2023) for children; parking cost 50 cents (equivalent to $5 in 2023); hamburgers, 35 cents (equivalent to $4 in 2023); soft drinks, 10 cents (equivalent to $1 in 2023). On opening day, guests could visit the six original themed sections: Mexico, Spain, France, The Confederacy, Texas, and Modern (representing the United States). According to the 1961 Park Map there were 46 \"major attractions\". The park's first season, lasting 45 days and ending on November 25, 1961, was a success, with over 550,000 visitors.\nDuring its first decade, the park added two sections: Boomtown, named after the boomtowns that sprang up quickly during Texas' oil boom era and the \"Tower Section\", named after the Oil Derrick observation tower built in 1969. The park also added two attractions: El Aserradero in 1963 and the Runaway Mine Train roller coaster in 1966. Attendance reached close to 2 million visitors a year by the end of the decade. \nIn 1974, Six Flags Over Texas announced attendance had reached 2,184,000.\nFor the 50th anniversary (2011), Six Flags Over Texas introduced the first I-Box roller coaster track with a transformation of Texas Giant. The reception from the conversion led the manufacturer to bring the new technology all over the world. \nDuring this time, Six Flags (the company) began to remove licensed theming from its theme parks, including from attractions that\nThe Arkansas–Texas A&M football rivalry is an American college football rivalry between the Arkansas Razorbacks and Texas A&M Aggies, which started in 1903. Between 1992 and 2008, the schools did not play each other when Arkansas left the Southwest Conference to join the Southeastern Conference. The rivalry was renewed as a neutral-site out-of-conference contest (and branded as The Southwest Classic) in 2009; in 2012 it once again became a conference rivalry when Texas A&M also joined the Southeastern Conference. Arkansas leads the series 42–36–3.\n\n\n== Series history ==\nArkansas and Texas A&M first played each other in 1903, and would play each other three times from 1903 to 1912, all as non-conference matchups.\nArkansas and Texas A&M would not meet on the field again until 1927, notwithstanding that both schools became charter members of the Southwest Conference twelve years earlier in 1915. The schools played annually from 1927 to 1930, but would not meet again until 1934. From 1934 to 1991, the two teams played annually as conference members. The annual matchup ceased in 1991 when Arkansas left the conference to join the Southeastern Conference.\nOn March 10, 2008, officials from both schools announced the series would recommence on October 3, 2009, under the name \"Southwest Classic.\" The annual location for the game was announced as Cowboys Stadium (now called AT&T Stadium), located in Arlington. The attendance for the stadium was initially expected to be in the 80,000 range. Depending on ticket demand, temporary seating can be added to the stadium to increase the capacity up to 100,000 seats for the game. The tickets were said to be split 50/50 between the two schools. The initial agreement between the two schools allowed the game to be played for at least 10 years, followed by 5 consecutive, 4-year rollover options, allowing the game to potentially be played for a total of 30 consecutive seasons.\nThe rivalry once again became a conference matchup when Texas A&M joined the SEC on July 1, 2012, and became a member of the West Division of the conference alongside Arkansas. However, for Texas A&M's first two seasons in the SEC the series was played as a home-and-home series at the schools' campuses (Texas A&M hosted in 2012 and Arkansas hosted in 2013); the series resumed neutral-site play in AT&T Stadium for the 2014 season until at least 2024. Multiple athletic directors at Texas A&M have expressed a desire to move away from playing the game at AT&T Stadium, and on July 20, 2020, it was reported that the game would be played at Kyle Field due to precautions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, with a return trip potentially being played at Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium in 2021. That return trip to Fayetteville did not happen, and the series resumed being played in Arlington in 2021.\nAfter joining the SEC in 2012, A&M went on a 9-game winning streak, which was its longest in the series and first winning streak of more than 2 games in the series for the Aggies since 1938–1943. Arkansas broke the streak in 2021 and improved its record against A&M in Arlington to 4–6.\nStarting in 2025, the game will no longer be a neutral-site game played in Arlington. Further, due to the expansion of the SEC in 2024, which eliminated divisions, the two teams will no longer meet on an annual basis, as both teams are not protected opponents of each other in conference scheduling.\n\n\n== Game results ==\n\n\n=== Locations ===\n\n\n== Notable games ==\n\n\n=== 1903 – First meeting ===\nTexas A&M 6 – Arkansas 0\n\nIn the first ever meeting, and only the 43rd game ever played by Arkansas and the 42nd ever played by Texas A&M, the Aggies won 6–0. The Aggies were coached by J. E. Platt and the Razorbacks were coached (in his only season as a head coach) by D. A. McDaniel.\n\n\n=== 1937 – First ranking in series ===\nArkansas 26 – Texas A&M 13\n\nAfter the introduction of the AP Poll in the 1936 season, the first ranking in the series came just the next year, with \nThe Arlington Renegades are a professional American football team based in Arlington, Texas. The Renegades compete in the United Football League (UFL). The team was founded as the Dallas Renegades by Vince McMahon's Alpha Entertainment and are owned-and-operated by Dwayne Johnson's Alpha Acquico and Fox Corporation. The Renegades play their home games at Choctaw Stadium. In 2023, The Renegades had a regular season record of 4-6 and were 2-0 in the playoffs, and were crowned XFL Champions. They were a part of the UFL merger in 2024, and started the 2024 season against the USFL Champion Birmingham Stallions.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Dallas (2020, McMahon era) ===\n\nOn December 5, 2018, Dallas was announced as one of eight cities that would join the newly reformed XFL, as well as Seattle, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Tampa Bay, and Washington, DC. On February 7, 2019, Bob Stoops, the longtime head coach of the Oklahoma Sooners football team, was hired as the Dallas team's head coach. Stoops was the XFL's first head coaching hire. On April 23, 2019, Stoops named Chris Woods as his defensive coordinator. On May 16, 2019, Stoops named Hal Mumme as his offensive coordinator. The team name and logo were revealed on August 21, 2019, as well as the teams uniforms on December 3, 2019.\nOn October 15, 2019, The Renegades announced their first player in team history, being assigned former NFL quarterback Landry Jones.\nDallas lost their first game, against the St. Louis BattleHawks, by a 15–9 final. Kicker Austin MacGinnis tallied all of the Renegade points via field goals, but Dallas' failure to reach the end zone came back to haunt them, as St. Louis scored nine unanswered fourth quarter points to erase a slim deficit. Linebacker Tegray Scales had 13 Dallas tackles, three for a loss. The Renegades picked up their first win on the road, a 25–18 triumph over the Los Angeles Wildcats. Running back Cameron Artis-Payne reached the end zone three times on two touchdowns and a one-point conversion. His final score, a 17-yard scoring run in the penultimate minute, was the final blow in a fourth quarter that saw the two teams combined for 34 points. Another road victory awaited the Renegades in Week 3, as they topped the Seattle Dragons 24–12. Two MacGinnis field goals sandwiched a 65-yard touchdown pass from Landry Jones to Donald Parham in a fourth quarter that saw Dallas break a 12–12 tie. Parham reached the end zone twice over the afternoon. The XFL announced that the remainder of the 2020 XFL season had been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The team finished with a 2–3 record. On April 10, 2020, the XFL suspended operations, with all employees, players and staff terminated.\n\n\n=== Arlington (2023–present, Dwayne Johnson and Dany Garcia era) ===\n\nOn August 3, 2020, it was reported that a consortium led by Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, Dany Garcia, and Gerry Cardinale (through Cardinale's fund RedBird Capital Partners) purchased the XFL for $15 million just hours before an auction could take place; the purchase received court approval on August 7, 2020. The XFL hired Bob Stoops as a Head Coach on April 13, 2022, with the expectation that he would be coaching Dallas. On July 24, 2022, the return of a Dallas XFL franchise was confirmed, this time being known as \"Arlington\" instead of \"Dallas\", as well as the hiring of Bob Stoops. On October 31, 2022, the XFL officially announced that the Renegades name would be returning, with a brand new logo. The team went 4–6 in the 2023 season, but made the playoffs as the second team in the South Division. After beating the Houston Roughnecks in the South Division playoff game, it won the 2023 XFL Championship Game over the 10–1 D.C. Defenders by a score of 35–26.\nIn September 2023, Axios reported that the XFL was in advanced talks with the USFL to merge the two leagues prior to the start of their 2024 seasons. On September 28, 2023, the XFL and USFL announced their intent to merge with details surrounding \nLake Arlington is a lake located in West Arlington, Texas.

It has a drainage area of 143 square miles (370 km2).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe lake was constructed by the city of Arlington in 1956, and was finished on March 31, 1957. It opened for fishing the following March on March 1, 1958.\nIn 1983, the lake came under scrutiny from residents of Fort Worth due to a large amount of dumping being performed into the lake.\nIn winter of 1993–94, the lake was refurbished with new docks. Two new docks and a boat loading ramp were installed at Richard W. Simpson Park, which borders the lake. The docks replaced 30-year old structures. The improvements cost $500,000, $300,000 coming from a 1991 bond issue, and $200,000 coming from a Texas Parks and Wildlife grant.\n\n\n== References ==\nThe UT Arlington Mavericks football team represented the University of Texas at Arlington from the 1959 through 1985 seasons.

UTA played its home games at multiple stadiums throughout their history with the most recent being Maverick Stadium, in Arlington, Texas.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe UT Arlington football team traces its roots to 1919 when the program was established at Grubbs Vocational College. By 1923, Grubbs was renamed as the North Texas Agricultural College with the football team then playing as the Junior Aggies competing in the Central Texas Conference. As the Aggies, the program captured four conference championships through the 1948 season. The 1943 North Texas Aggies football team was ranked at No. 69 among the nation's college and military service teams in the final 1943 Litkenhous Ratings.\nBy 1949, the school changed its name and mascot again, competing as the Arlington State Blue Riders through the 1950 season only to once more change the mascot to the Rebels for the 1951 season. Arlington would reach their zenith as a junior college program in capturing both the 1956 and 1957 Junior Rose Bowls as national junior college champions. Following the 1958 season, Arlington State became a four-year school and begin competition as a College Division school.\nAfter founding the Southland Conference as a charter member for the 1964 season, by 1966, the school officially became the University of Texas at Arlington. UTA won conference championships in 1966, 1967 and 1981 seasons in addition to winning their lone bowl game, the 1967 Pecan Bowl. The program would be officially disbanded after an announcement by then university president Wendell Nedderman on November 25, 1985, citing financial loss and low attendance as the primary impetus for its abandonment.\nDespite the team's disbandment, the UTA Maverick Marching Band was determined to stay intact. They shifted focus to performing at various contests and events around the state and remain one of the only college marching bands in the United States to stand alone without a football program.\nIn 2023, the UTA students voted on a referendum which gauged student support for the return of football resulting in increased student fees.

They are one of two major league clubs based in Texas, alongside the Houston Astros of the same league. The team was founded as the Washington Senators in 1961, an expansion team awarded to Washington, D.C., after its previous team became the Minnesota Twins. The new Senators relocated to Arlington, Texas after the 1971 season and debuted as the Rangers the following spring. In 2020, the Rangers moved to the new Globe Life Field after having played at Globe Life Park (now Choctaw Stadium) from 1994 to 2019.

In 2010, the Rangers advanced past the Division Series for the first time, defeating the Tampa Bay Rays. The team then won their first American League pennant after beating the New York Yankees in six games; league MVP Josh Hamilton won their first ALCS MVP award for a Ranger player. In their first appearance in a World Series, the Rangers fell to the San Francisco Giants in five games.

As part of the expansion, the American League added two expansion teams for the 1961 season–the Los Angeles Angels and a new Washington Senators team. The new Senators and Angels began to fill their rosters with American League players in an expansion draft. The team played their inaugural season at old Griffith Stadium, then moved to the new District of Columbia Stadium in 1962 under a ten-year lease.\n\nFor most of their existence, the new Senators epitomized futility, losing an average of 90 games a season. The team's struggles led to a twist on a joke about the old Senators: \"Washington: first in war, first in peace and still last in the American League.\" Frank Howard, an outfielder/first baseman from 1965 to 1972 known for his towering home runs, was the team's most accomplished player, winning two home run titles.\nThe concurrent rise of the nearby Baltimore Orioles to regular championship contenders (winning their first World Series in 1966) certainly did not help the Senators draw crowds. Further expansion and re-alignment in 1969 did not do much to help the Senators either, since (unlike the National League) the AL owners elected to align their new divisions strictly based on geography. This arrangement placed both expansion teams (the Seattle Pilots and the Kansas City Royals) in the AL West, while pitting last place Washington against the AL's five best teams in the AL East. Despite this, the Senators managed a winning season in 1969 (their only winning record in the nation's capital) when Hall of Famer Ted Wi\nThe 1985 UT Arlington Mavericks football team was an American football team that represented the University of Texas at Arlington in the Southland Conference during the 1985 NCAA Division I-AA football season.

The plant has operated for more than 60 years and today manufactures large SUVs from GM's divisions Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Arlington plant was opened in 1954 to assemble both automobiles and aircraft, but has focused on the former use for most of its history. Arlington Assembly was originally part of the Buick-Oldsmobile-Pontiac Assembly Division and was used to assemble Buicks, Oldsmobiles, and Pontiacs. The Buick-Oldsmobile-Pontiac Assembly Division was renamed General Motors Assembly Division in 1965 after it also began to assemble Chevrolet cars in 1963. Early automobile production included models like the Pontiac Chieftain and later, the Chevrolet Bel Air.  The factory would continue to produce many large GM cars through the 1990s including products from Buick, Oldsmobile, Chevrolet and Cadillac.  Arlington Assembly was the last GM B-body manufacturing facility when GM decided to consolidate operations and convert the plant to SUV production.  The plant occupies 250 acres (1,000,000 square meters). Arlington Assembly has produced models for all of GM's primary American brands: Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, Cadillac, and GMC. \nThe first GM factory in the \"Dallas-Ft. Worth\" area was originally built in 1917 to build the Chevrolet Series 490 and the Chevrolet Series F on the south side of West Seventh Street and Slayton Street just west of Trinity Park. Due to a flood of the Trinity River in 1922 and flood control taxes levied by the local government, GM closed the factory in 1924 and in 1929 Leeds Assembly opened in Kansas City, Missouri.

It was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion Texas Rangers and the National League (NL) champion Arizona Diamondbacks. The series began on October 27 and ended on November 1 with Texas winning in five games. The Rangers won their first World Series title since their founding in 1961. This marked the first time since 1989 in which consecutive championships were won by different teams from the same state.\nThe Rangers and Diamondbacks entered the 2023 MLB postseason as wild cards, making this the third World Series meeting between two wild cards following 2002 and 2014. The Rangers had home-field advantage in the series over the Diamondbacks due to their better regular season record. The Rangers and Diamondbacks split the first two games in Texas before the Rangers won three consecutive games in Arizona to win the series. Corey Seager won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award for the second time in his career.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Texas Rangers and the Arizona Diamondbacks. Both teams lost over 100 games in 2021. The teams' 174 combined wins is the lowest ever total for a non-shortened season World Series. This was the first World Series between one team that has never won in any prior appearances and another team that has never lost in any prior appearances. MLB has paired these two teams up as interleague rivals from 1998 to 2000 and in 2013, 2019, and since 2023. This was the fifth straight World Series to have games played in a venue in Texas, with Houston co-hosting in 2019, 2021, and 2022, and Arlington hosting in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, this was the first World Series since 2016 to not feature the Houston Astros or Los Angeles Dodgers.\nThe Diamondbacks won the regular season series 3–1, splitting a two-game series in May at Globe Life Field, and sweeping the Rangers at Chase Field in August.\nThis was the third time in World Series history that the two teams that faced each other were both from the Expansion era, the first coming in 2015 and the second in 2019.\nThis was the sixth World Series overall to be played entirely on artificial turf. Before 2023, the most recent of the six to be played in the two home team's stadiums was the 1993 World Series (which was the fourth one). However, the last “all-artificial turf” overall (the fifth one) before 2023 had been at the neutrally located 2020 World Series, with all games played at Globe Life Field, where the first two games of 2023 were also played. 2023 is only the second World Series to be played entirely on the second generation artificial turf (with 2020 being the first).\nFinally, this was the second World Series ever to be played entirely in domed stadiums after the neutral site 2020 World Series. It was the first to be played between two domed stadium teams and with each hosting games.\n\n\n=== Texas Rangers ===\n\nDuring the regular season, the Texas Rangers were led by an AL-best offense in runs scored and were tied with the Minnesota Twins in home runs. The Rangers led the AL at the All-Star Game with six players in Adolis García, Jonah Heim, Josh Jung, Corey Seager, Marcus Semien, and Nathan Eovaldi. Mid-season injuries to staff-aces Jacob deGrom and Eovaldi and subpar performance in the bullpen led the Rangers to acquire closer Aroldis Chapman, middle reliever Chris Stratton, and starting pitchers Jordan Montgomery and Max Scherzer. Despite leading the AL West for most of the season, poor play late in the year saw the team finish second in the division behind the Houston Astros; the teams had identical win-loss records, but Houston owned a better head-to-head record.\nThe Rangers qualified for the postseason as the fifth seed wild card entrant in the American League just two years removed from a 102-loss season.

The rich soil of the area attracted farmers, and several agriculture-related businesses were well established by the late nineteenth century.\nArlington was founded in 1876 along the Texas and Pacific Railway. Named after General Robert E. Lee's Arlington House in Arlington County, Virginia., Arlington grew as a cotton-ginning and farming center, and incorporated on April 21, 1884. The city could boast of water, electricity, natural gas, and telephone services by 1910, along with a public school system."

The well has been paved over.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, life in Arlington was bustling with controversy and entertainment. In the early 1920s, a tea room known as \"Top O' Hill Terrace\" opened up along the now-defunct Bankhead Highway to serve dinner and tea to guests traveling through Dallas and Fort Worth. Ownership changed in the late 1920s and shortly thereafter the facilities were secretly converted into casinos and a speakeasy. Known by historians as \"Vegas before Vegas\", escape tunnels and secret rooms were constructed to hide the illegal gambling during police raids. However, the restaurant portion of the facility still existed as a legitimate business and a front."

The track was immensely profitable at that point, making a daily average of $113,000 before inflation with a daily attendance average of 6,700 people.

The Chevrolet Motor Company Building in Dallas replaced the Trinity Park facility from 1923 until 1935 and was replaced by the more advanced Arlington Factory in the early 1950s."
