{"page_content": "Zirconium is a chemical element; it has symbol Zr and atomic number 40. First identified in 1789, isolated in impure form in 1824, and manufactured at scale by 1925, pure zirconium is a lustrous transition metal with a greyish-white color that closely resembles hafnium and, to a lesser extent, titanium. It is solid at room temperature, ductile, malleable and corrosion-resistant. The name zirconium is derived from the name of the mineral zircon, the most important source of zirconium. The word is related to Persian zargun (zircon; zar-gun, \"gold-like\" or \"as gold\"). Besides zircon, zirconium occurs in over 140 other minerals, including baddeleyite and eudialyte; most zirconium is produced as a byproduct of minerals mined for titanium and tin.\nZirconium forms a variety of inorganic compounds, such as zirconium dioxide, and organometallic compounds, such as zirconocene dichloride. Five isotopes occur naturally, four of which are stable. The metal and its alloys are mainly used as a refractory and opacifier; pure zirconium plays a vital role in the construction of nuclear reactors due to strong resistance to corrosion and low nuclear reaction cross section, and in space vehicles and turbine blades where high heat resistance is necessary. Zirconium also finds uses in flashbulbs, biomedical applications such as dental implants and prosthetics, deodorant, and water purification systems.\nZirconium compounds have no known biological role, though the element is widely distributed in nature and appears in small quantities in biological systems without adverse effects. There is no indication of zirconium as a carcinogen. The main hazards posed by zirconium are flammability in powder form and irritation of the eyes.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nZirconium is a lustrous, greyish-white, soft, ductile, malleable metal that is solid at room temperature, though it is hard and brittle at lesser purities. In powder form, zirconium is highly flammable, but the solid form is much less prone to ignition. Zirconium is highly resistant to corrosion by alkalis, acids, salt water and other agents. However, it will dissolve in hydrochloric and sulfuric acid, especially when fluorine is present. Alloys with zinc are magnetic at less than 35 K.\nThe melting point of zirconium is 1855 \u00b0C (3371 \u00b0F), and the boiling point is 4409 \u00b0C (7968 \u00b0F). Zirconium has an electronegativity of 1.33 on the Pauling scale. Of the elements within the d-block with known electronegativities, zirconium has the fourth lowest electronegativity after hafnium, yttrium, and lutetium.\nAt room temperature zirconium exhibits a hexagonally close-packed crystal structure, \u03b1-Zr, which changes to \u03b2-Zr, a body-centered cubic crystal structure, at 863 \u00b0C. Zirconium exists in the \u03b2-phase until the melting point.\n\n\n=== Isotopes ===\n\nNaturally occurring zirconium is composed of five isotopes. 90Zr, 91Zr, 92Zr and 94Zr are stable, although 94Zr is predicted to undergo double beta decay (not observed experimentally) with a half-life of more than 1.10\u00d71017 years. 96Zr has a half-life of 2.34\u00d71019 years, and is the longest-lived radioisotope of zirconium. Of these natural isotopes, 90Zr is the most common, making up 51.45% of all zirconium. 96Zr is the least common, comprising only 2.80% of zirconium.\nThirty-three artificial isotopes of zirconium have been synthesized, ranging in atomic mass from 77 to 114. 93Zr is the longest-lived artificial isotope, with a half-life of 1.61\u00d7106 years. Radioactive isotopes at or above mass number 93 decay by electron emission, whereas those at or below 89 decay by positron emission. The only exception is 88Zr, which decays by electron capture.\nThirteen isotopes of zirconium also exist as metastable isomers: 83m1Zr, 83m2Zr, 85mZr, 87mZr, 88mZr, 89mZr, 90m1Zr, 90m2Zr, 91mZr, 97mZr, 98mZr, 99mZr, and 108mZr. Of these, 97mZr has the shortest half-life at 104.8 nanoseconds. 89mZr is the longest lived with a half-life of 4.161 minutes.\n\n\n=== Occurrence ===\n\nZirconium has a con\nZirconium monophosphide is a binary inorganic compound of zirconium metal and phosphorus with the chemical formula ZrP.\n\n\n== Preparation ==\nZirconium monophosphide can be prepared from direct reaction of zirconium powders with red phosphorus:\n\n4 Zr + P4  \u2192  4 ZrP\n\n\n== Physical properties ==\nThe \u03b1-form of zirconium monophosphide has a NaCl crystal structure. The \u03b2-form structure is hexagonal. The \u03b1-form is a superconductor if cooled below 5K.\n\n\n== References ==\nZirconium dioxide (ZrO2), sometimes known as zirconia (not to be confused with zirconium silicate or zircon), is a white crystalline oxide of zirconium. Its most naturally occurring form, with a monoclinic crystalline structure, is the mineral baddeleyite. A dopant stabilized cubic structured zirconia, cubic zirconia, is synthesized in various colours for use as a gemstone and a diamond simulant.\n\n\n== Production, chemical properties, occurrence ==\nZirconia is produced by calcining zirconium compounds, exploiting its high thermostability.\n\n\n=== Structure ===\nThree phases are known: monoclinic below 1170 \u00b0C, tetragonal between 1170 \u00b0C and 2370 \u00b0C, and cubic above 2370 \u00b0C.  The trend is for higher symmetry at higher temperatures, as is usually the case. A small percentage of the oxides of calcium or yttrium stabilize in the cubic phase.  The very rare mineral tazheranite, (Zr,Ti,Ca)O2, is cubic. Unlike TiO2, which features six-coordinated titanium in all phases, monoclinic zirconia consists of seven-coordinated zirconium centres. This difference is attributed to the larger size of the zirconium atom relative to the titanium atom.\n\n\n=== Chemical reactions ===\nZirconia is chemically unreactive.  It is slowly attacked by concentrated hydrofluoric acid and sulfuric acid.  When heated with carbon, it converts to zirconium carbide.  When heated with carbon in the presence of chlorine, it converts to zirconium(IV) chloride.  This conversion is the basis for the purification of zirconium metal and is analogous to the Kroll process.\n\n\n== Engineering properties ==\n\nZirconium dioxide is one of the most studied ceramic materials. ZrO2 adopts a monoclinic crystal structure at room temperature and transitions to tetragonal and cubic at higher temperatures. The change of volume caused by the structure transitions from tetragonal to monoclinic to cubic induces large stresses, causing it to crack upon cooling from high temperatures. When the zirconia is blended with some other oxides, the tetragonal and/or cubic phases are stabilized. Effective dopants include magnesium oxide (MgO), yttrium oxide (Y2O3, yttria), calcium oxide (CaO), and cerium(III) oxide (Ce2O3).\nZirconia is often more useful in its phase 'stabilized' state. Upon heating, zirconia undergoes disruptive phase changes. By adding small percentages of yttria, these phase changes are eliminated, and the resulting material has superior thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties. In some cases, the tetragonal phase can be metastable. If sufficient quantities of the metastable tetragonal phase is present, then an applied stress, magnified by the stress concentration at a crack tip, can cause the tetragonal phase to convert to monoclinic, with the associated volume expansion. This phase transformation can then put the crack into compression, retarding its growth, and enhancing the fracture toughness. This mechanism, known as transformation toughening, significantly extends the reliability and lifetime of products made with stabilized zirconia.\nThe ZrO2 band gap is dependent on the phase (cubic, tetragonal, monoclinic, or amorphous) and preparation methods, with typical estimates from 5\u20137 eV.\nA special case of zirconia is that of tetragonal zirconia polycrystal, or TZP, which is indicative of polycrystalline zirconia composed of only the metastable tetragonal phase.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nThe main use of zirconia is in the production of hard ceramics, such as in dentistry, with other uses including as a protective coating on particles of titanium dioxide pigments,  as a refractory material, in insulation, abrasives, and enamels.\nStabilized zirconia is used in oxygen sensors and fuel cell membranes because it has the ability to allow oxygen ions to move freely through the crystal structure at high temperatures. This high ionic conductivity (and a low electronic conductivity) makes it one of the most useful electroceramics. Zirconium dioxide is also used as the solid electrolyte in electrochromic d\nNaturally occurring zirconium (40Zr) is composed of four stable isotopes (of which one may in the future be found radioactive), and one very long-lived radioisotope (96Zr), a primordial nuclide that decays via double beta decay with an observed half-life of 2.0\u00d71019 years; it can also undergo single beta decay, which is not yet observed, but the theoretically predicted value of t1/2 is 2.4\u00d71020 years. The second most stable radioisotope is 93Zr, which has a half-life of 1.53 million years. Thirty other radioisotopes have been observed. All have half-lives less than a day except for 95Zr (64.02 days), 88Zr (83.4 days), and 89Zr (78.41 hours). The primary decay mode is electron capture for isotopes lighter than 92Zr, and the primary mode for heavier isotopes is beta decay.\n\n\n== List of isotopes ==\n\n\n== Zirconium-88 ==\n88Zr is a radioisotope of zirconium with a half-life of 83.4 days. In January 2019, this isotope was discovered to have a neutron capture cross section of approximately 861,000 barns; this is several orders of magnitude greater than predicted, and greater than that of any other nuclide except xenon-135.\n\n\n== Zirconium-89 ==\n89Zr is a radioisotope of zirconium with a half-life of 78.41 hours. It is produced by proton irradiation of natural yttrium-89. Its most prominent gamma photon has an energy of 909 keV.\nZirconium-89 is employed in specialized diagnostic applications using positron emission tomography imaging, for example, with zirconium-89 labeled antibodies (immuno-PET). For a decay table, see Maria Vosjan. \"Zirconium-89 (89Zr)\". Cyclotron.nl.\n\n\n== Zirconium-93 ==\n\n93Zr is a radioisotope of zirconium with a half-life of 1.53 million years, decaying through emission of a low-energy beta particle. 73% of decays populate an excited state of niobium-93, which decays with a half-life of 14 years and a low-energy gamma ray to the stable ground state of 93Nb, while the remaining 27% of decays directly populate the  ground state. It is one of only 7 long-lived fission products. The low specific activity and low energy of its radiations limit the radioactive hazards of this isotope.\nNuclear fission produces it at a fission yield of 6.3% (thermal neutron fission of 235U), on a par with the other most abundant fission products. Nuclear reactors usually contain large amounts of zirconium as fuel rod cladding (see zircaloy), and neutron irradiation of 92Zr also produces some 93Zr, though this is limited by 92Zr's low neutron capture cross section of 0.22 barns. Indeed, one of the primary reasons for using zirconium in fuel rod cladding is its low cross section.\n93Zr also has a low neutron capture cross section of 0.7 barns. Most fission zirconium consists of other isotopes; the other isotope with a significant neutron absorption cross section is 91Zr with a cross section of 1.24 barns. 93Zr is a less attractive candidate for disposal by nuclear transmutation than are 99Tc and 129I. Mobility in soil is relatively low, so that geological disposal may be an adequate solution. Alternatively, if the effect on the neutron economy of 93Zr's higher cross section is deemed acceptable, irradiated cladding and fission product Zirconium (which are mixed together in most current nuclear reprocessing methods) could be used to form new zircalloy cladding. Once the cladding is inside the reactor, the relatively low level radioactivity can be tolerated, but transport and manufacturing might require special precautions.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nIsotope masses from:\nAudi, Georges; Bersillon, Olivier; Blachot, Jean; Wapstra, Aaldert Hendrik (2003), \"The NUBASE evaluation of nuclear and decay properties\", Nuclear Physics A, 729: 3\u2013128, Bibcode:2003NuPhA.729....3A, doi:10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001\nIsotopic compositions and standard atomic masses from:\nde Laeter, John Robert; B\u00f6hlke, John Karl; De Bi\u00e8vre, Paul; Hidaka, Hiroshi; Peiser, H.

Review 2000 (IUPAC\nZirconium phosphates (zirconium hydrogen phosphate) are acidic, inorganic cation exchange materials that have a layered structure with formula Zr(HPO4)2\u2219nH2O.  These salts have high thermal and chemical stability, solid state ion conductivity, resistance to ionizing radiation, and the capacity to incorporate different types of molecules with different sizes between their layers.  There are various phases of zirconium phosphate which vary in their interlaminar spaces and their crystalline structure.  Among all the Zirconium phosphate phases the most widely used are the alpha (Zr(HPO4)2\u2219H2O) and the gamma (Zr(PO4)(H2PO4)\u22192H2O) phase. The salts have been widely used in several applications such as: drug delivery, catalysis, nanocomposite, nuclear waste management, clinical dialyzer, among others.\n\n\n== Crystal structure ==\nZirconium phosphate crystal structure was elucidated by Clearfield and coworkers in 1968 by the single-crystal method.  The layered structure of \u03b1-Zirconium phosphate consists of Zr(IV) ions situated alternately slightly above and below the ab plane, forming an octahedron with the oxygen atoms of the tetrahedral phosphate groups.  Of the four oxygen atoms in the phosphate groups, three are bonded to three different Zr atoms, forming a cross-linked covalent network.  The fourth oxygen atom of the phosphate is perpendicular to the layer pointed toward the interlayer region.  In the interlayer region is localized a zeolitic cavity where a basal water molecule resides, forming a hydrogen bond with the OH group of the phosphate that is perpendicular to the layer.  The alpha phase of zirconium phosphate is under the  P21/n space group, with cell dimensions of a = 9.060 \u00c5, b = 5.297 \u00c5, c = 15.414 \u00c5, \u03b1 = \u03b3 = 90\u00b0, \u03b2 = 101.71\u00b0 and Z = 4.21  The basal interlayer distance for the \u03b1-Zirconium phosphate is 7.6 \u00c5, where 6.6 \u00c5 is the layer thickness and the remaining 1 \u00c5 space is occupied by the interstitial water molecules in the interlayer gallery.  The distance between adjacent orthophosphates on one side of the layer is 5.3 \u00c5.  There are two phosphates in each ab plane in the surface layer forming a \u201cfree area\u201d of 24 \u00c52 associated to each phosphate group.\nFor the gamma phase (\u03b3-Zirconium phosphate), unfortunately, an appropriate single crystal for single-crystal structure determination has been futile to obtain.  In 1995 Clearfield and coworkers elucidated its structure using X-ray powder diffractometry (XRPD) and the Rietveld refinement method.  The structure of \u03b3-Zirconium phosphate consists of Zr(IV) atoms octahedrally coordinated to four different oxygen atoms of an orthophosphate.  The other two resting octahedral position of the Zr(IV) atoms are occupied by two different dihydrogen phosphate groups.  The orthophosphate molecules are located alternatively above and below the ab main plane and the dihydrogen phosphates are in the layer edges crosslinked by two of their oxygen atoms to two different zirconium atoms.  The remaining two hydroxyl groups of the dihydrogen phosphate are pointing toward the interlayer gallery forming a pocket where a hydrogen bond is formed with the interlayer water molecules.  The basal interlayer distance for \u03b3-Zirconium phosphate is 12.2 \u00c5, and the area surrounding the dihydrogen phosphate on the surface of the layers is 35 \u00c52.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet)\nZirconium(IV) fluoride describes members of a family inorganic compounds with the formula ZrF4(H2O)x.

The hardness of single-crystal ZrN is 22.7\u00b11.7 GPa and elastic modulus is 450 GPa.\n\n\n== Uses ==\n\nZirconium nitride is a hard ceramic material similar to titanium nitride and is a cement-like refractory material. Thus it is used in cermets and laboratory crucibles. When applied using the physical vapor deposition coating process it is commonly used for coating medical devices, industrial parts (notably drill bits), automotive and aerospace components and other parts subject to high wear and corrosive environments. \nZirconium nitride was suggested as a hydrogen peroxide fuel tank liner for rockets and aircraft.\n\n\n== References ==\nZirconium(IV) chloride, also known as zirconium tetrachloride, (ZrCl4) is an inorganic compound frequently used as a precursor to other compounds of zirconium. This white high-melting solid hydrolyzes rapidly in humid air.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nUnlike molecular TiCl4, solid ZrCl4 adopts a polymeric structure wherein each Zr is octahedrally coordinated. This difference in structures is responsible for the disparity in their properties: TiCl4 is distillable, but ZrCl4 is a solid. In the solid state, ZrCl4 adopts a tape-like linear polymeric structure\u2014the same structure adopted by HfCl4. This polymer degrades readily upon treatment with Lewis bases, which cleave the Zr-Cl-Zr linkages.\n\n\n== Synthesis ==\nThis conversion entails treatment of zirconium oxide with carbon in the presence of chlorine at high temperature:\n\nZrO2 + 2 C + 2 Cl2 \u2192 ZrCl4 + 2 CO\nA laboratory scale process uses carbon tetrachloride in place of carbon and chlorine:\n\nZrO2 + 2 CCl4 \u2192 ZrCl4 + 2 COCl2\n\n\n== Applications ==\n\n\n=== Precursor to zirconium metal ===\nZrCl4 is an intermediate in the conversion of zirconium minerals to metallic zirconium by the Kroll process. In nature, zirconium minerals usually exist as oxides (reflected also by the tendency of all zirconium chlorides to hydrolyze). For their conversion to bulk metal, these refractory oxides are first converted to the tetrachloride, which can be distilled at high temperatures. The purified ZrCl4 can be reduced with Zr metal to produce zirconium(III) chloride.\n\n\n=== Other uses ===\nZrCl4 is the most common precursor for chemical vapor deposition of zirconium dioxide and zirconium diboride.\nIn organic synthesis zirconium tetrachloride is used as a weak Lewis acid for the Friedel-Crafts reaction, the Diels-Alder reaction and intramolecular cyclisation reactions. It is also used to make water-repellent treatment of textiles and other fibrous materials.\n\n\n== Properties and reactions ==\nHydrolysis of ZrCl4 gives the hydrated hydroxy chloride cluster called zirconyl chloride. This reaction is rapid and virtually irreversible, consistent with the high oxophilicity of zirconium(IV). For this reason, manipulations of ZrCl4 typically require air-free techniques.\nZrCl4 is the principal starting compound for the synthesis of many organometallic complexes of zirconium. Because of its polymeric structure, ZrCl4 is usually converted to a molecular complex before use. It forms a 1:2 complex with tetrahydrofuran: CAS [21959-01-3], mp 175\u2013177 \u00b0C.  Sodium cyclopentadienide (NaC5H5) reacts with ZrCl4(THF)2 to give zirconocene dichloride, ZrCl2(C5H5)2, a versatile organozirconium complex. One of the most curious properties of  ZrCl4 is its high solubility in the presence of methylated benzenes, such as durene. This solubilization arises through the formation of \u03c0-complexes.\nThe log (base 10) of the vapor pressure of zirconium tetrachloride (from 480 to 689 K) is given by the equation: log10(P) = \u22125400/T + 11.766, where the pressure is measured in torrs and temperature in kelvins. The log (base 10) of the vapor pressure of solid zirconium tetrachloride (from 710 to 741 K) is given by the equation log10(P) = \u22123427/T + 9.088. The pressure at the melting point is 14,500 torrs.\n\n\n== References ==\nZirconium silicate, also zirconium orthosilicate, ZrSiO4, is a chemical compound, a silicate of zirconium. It occurs in nature as zircon, a silicate mineral. Powdered zirconium silicate is also known as zircon flour.\nZirconium silicate is usually colorless, but impurities induce various colorations. It is insoluble in water, acids, alkali and aqua regia. Hardness is 7.5 on the Mohs scale.\n\n\n== Structure and bonding ==\nZircon consists of 8-coordinated Zr4+ centers linked to tetrahedral orthosilicate SiO44- sites.  The oxygen atoms are all triply bridging, each with the environment OZr2Si.  Given its highly crosslinked structure, the material is hard, and hence prized as gemstone and abrasive.\nZr(IV) is a d0 ion.  Consequently the material is colorless and diamagnetic.\n\n\n== Production ==\nZirconium silicate occurs in nature as mineral zircon. Concentrated sources of zircon are rare.  It is mined from sand deposits and separated by gravity.  Some sands contain a few percent of zircon.\nIt can also be synthesized by fusion of SiO2 and ZrO2 in an arc furnace, or by reacting a zirconium salt with sodium silicate in an aqueous solution.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nAs of 1995, the annual consumption of zirconium silicate  was nearly 1M tons.  The major applications exploit its refractory nature and resistance to corrosion by alkali materials. Two end-uses are for enamels, and ceramic glazes. In enamels and glazes it serves as an opacifier. It can be also present in some cements.\nAnother use of zirconium silicate is as beads for milling and grinding.\nThin films of zirconium silicate and hafnium silicate produced by chemical vapor deposition, most often MOCVD, can be used as a high-k dielectric as a replacement for silicon dioxide in semiconductors.\nZirconium silicates have also been studied for potential use in medical applications. For example, ZS-9 is a zirconium silicate that was designed specifically to trap potassium ions over other ions throughout the gastrointestinal tract.\nZirconium silicate is also used as foundry sands due to its high thermal stability. t is also the primary source of zirconium, which is used in various applications, including in nuclear reactors, due to its high resistance to corrosion and low neutron absorption.\n\n\n== Toxicity ==\nZirconium silicate is an abrasive irritant for skin and eyes.

The synthesized material is hard and usually colorless, but may be made in a variety of different colors. It should not be confused with zircon, which is a zirconium silicate (ZrSiO4). It is sometimes erroneously called cubic zirconium.\nBecause of its low cost, durability, and close visual likeness to diamond, synthetic cubic zirconia has remained the most gemologically and economically important competitor for diamonds since commercial production began in 1976. Its main competitor as a synthetic gemstone is a more recently cultivated material, synthetic moissanite.\n\n\n== Technical aspects ==\nCubic zirconia is crystallographically isometric, an important attribute of a would-be diamond simulant. During synthesis zirconium oxide naturally forms monoclinic crystals, which are stable under normal atmospheric conditions. A stabilizer is required for cubic crystals (taking on the fluorite structure) to form, and remain stable at ordinary temperatures; typically this is either yttrium or calcium oxide, the amount of stabilizer used depending on the many recipes of individual manufacturers. Therefore, the physical and optical properties of synthesized CZ vary, all values being ranges.\nIt is a dense substance, with a density between 5.6 and 6.0 g/cm3\u2014about 1.65 times that of diamond. Cubic zirconia is relatively hard, 8\u20138.5 on the Mohs scale\u2014slightly harder than most semi-precious natural gems. Its refractive index is high at 2.15\u20132.18 (compared to 2.42 for diamonds) and its luster is  Adamantine lustre. Its dispersion is very high at 0.058\u20130.066, exceeding that of diamond (0.044). Cubic zirconia has no cleavage and exhibits a conchoidal fracture. Because of its high hardness, it is generally considered  brittle. \nUnder shortwave UV cubic zirconia typically fluoresces a yellow, greenish yellow or \"beige\". Under longwave UV the effect is greatly diminished, with a whitish glow sometimes being seen. Colored stones may show a strong, complex rare earth absorption spectrum.\n\n\n== History ==\nDiscovered in 1892, the yellowish monoclinic mineral baddeleyite is a natural form of zirconium oxide.\nThe high melting point of zirconia (2750 \u00b0C or 4976 \u00b0F) hinders controlled growth of single crystals. However, stabilization of cubic zirconium oxide had been realized early on, with the synthetic product stabilized zirconia introduced in 1929. Although cubic, it was in the form of a polycrystalline ceramic: it was used as a refractory material, highly resistant to chemical and thermal attack (up to 2540 \u00b0C or 4604 \u00b0F).\nIn 1937, German mineralogists M. V. Stackelberg and K. Chudoba discovered naturally occurring cubic zirconia in the form of microscopic grains included in metamict zircon. This was thought to be a byproduct of the metamictization process, but the two scientists did not think the mineral important enough to give it a formal name. The discovery was confirmed through X-ray diffraction, proving the existence of a natural counterpart to the synthetic product.\nAs with the majority of grown diamond substitutes, the idea of producing single-crystal cubic zirconia arose in the minds of scientists seeking a new and versatile material for use in lasers and other optical applications. Its production eventually exceeded that of earlier synthetics, such as synthetic strontium titanate, synthetic rutile, YAG (yttrium aluminium garnet) and GGG (gadolinium gallium garnet).\nSome of the earliest research into controlled single-crystal growth of cubic zirconia occurred in 1960s France, much work being done by Y. Roulin and R. Collongues. This technique involved molten zirconia being contained within a thin shell of still-solid zirconia, with crystal growth from the melt. The process was named cold crucible, an allusion to the system of water cooling used. Though promising, these attempts yielded only small crystals.\nLater, Soviet scientists under V. V. Osiko in the La\nZirconium alloys are solid solutions of zirconium or other metals, a common subgroup having the trade mark Zircaloy. Zirconium has very low absorption cross-section of thermal neutrons, high hardness, ductility and corrosion resistance. One of the main uses of zirconium alloys is in nuclear technology, as cladding of fuel rods in nuclear reactors, especially water reactors. A typical composition of nuclear-grade zirconium alloys is more than 95 weight percent zirconium and less than 2% of tin, niobium, iron, chromium, nickel and other metals, which are added to improve mechanical properties and corrosion resistance.\nThe water cooling of reactor zirconium alloys elevates requirement for their resistance to oxidation-related nodular corrosion. Furthermore, oxidative reaction of zirconium with water releases hydrogen gas, which partly diffuses into the alloy and forms zirconium hydrides. The hydrides are less dense and are weaker mechanically than the alloy; their formation results in blistering and cracking of the cladding \u2013 a phenomenon known as hydrogen embrittlement.\n\n\n== Production and properties ==\nCommercial non-nuclear grade zirconium typically contains 1\u20135% of hafnium, whose neutron absorption cross-section is 600 times that of zirconium. Hafnium must therefore be almost entirely removed (reduced to < 0.02% of the alloy) for reactor applications.\nNuclear-grade zirconium alloys contain more than 95% Zr, and therefore most of their properties are similar to those of pure zirconium. The absorption cross section for thermal neutrons is 0.18 barn for zirconium, which is much lower than that for such common metals as iron (2.4 barn) and nickel (4.5 barn). The composition and the main applications of common reactor-grade alloys are summarized below. These alloys contain less than 0.3% of iron and chromium and 0.1\u20130.14% oxygen.\n\n*ZIRLO stands for zirconium low oxidation.\n\n\n== Microstructure ==\n\nAt temperatures below 1100 K, zirconium alloys belong to the hexagonal crystal family (HCP). Its microstructure, revealed by chemical attack, shows needle-like grains typical of a Widmanst\u00e4tten pattern. Upon annealing below the phase transition temperature (\u03b1-Zr to \u03b2-Zr) the grains are equiaxed with sizes varying from 3 to 5 \u03bcm.\n\n\n== Development ==\nZircaloy 1 was developed after zirconium was selected by Admiral H.G. Rickover as the structural material for high flux zone reactor components and cladding for fuel pellet tube bundles in prototype submarine reactors in the late 1940s. The choice was owing to a combination of strength, low neutron cross section and corrosion resistance. Zircaloy-2 was inadvertently developed, by melting Zircaloy-1 in a crucible previously used for stainless steel. Newer alloys are Ni-free, including Zircaloy-4, ZIRLO and M5 (with 1% niobium).\n\n\n== Oxidation of zirconium alloy ==\nZirconium alloys readily react with oxygen, forming a nanometer-thin passivation layer. The corrosion resistance of the alloys may degrade significantly when some impurities (e.g. more than 40 ppm of carbon or more than 300 ppm of nitrogen) are present. Corrosion resistance of zirconium alloys is enhanced by intentional development of thicker passivation layer of black lustrous zirconium oxide. Nitride coatings might also be used.\nWhereas there is no consensus on whether zirconium and zirconium alloy have the same oxidation rate, Zircaloys 2 and 4 do behave very similarly in this respect. Oxidation occurs at the same rate in air or in water and proceeds in ambient condition or in high vacuum. A sub-micrometer thin layer of zirconium dioxide is rapidly formed in the surface and stops the further diffusion of oxygen to the bulk and the subsequent oxidation. The dependence of oxidation rate R on temperature and pressure can be expressed as\n\nR = 13.9\u00b7P1/6\u00b7exp(\u22121.47/kBT)\nThe oxidation rate R is here expressed in gram/(cm2\u00b7second); P is the pressure in atmosphere, that is the factor P1/6 = 1 at ambient pressure; the activation energy is 1.47\nZirconium disilicide is an inorganic chemical compound with the chemical formula ZrSi2, consisting of zirconium and silicon atoms.  It is a ceramic, but not very hard and very brittle.\n\n\n== References ==\nZirconium nitrate is a volatile anhydrous transition metal nitrate salt of zirconium with formula Zr(NO3)4. It has alternate names of zirconium tetranitrate, or zirconium(IV) nitrate.\nIt has a UN number of UN 2728 and is class 5.1, meaning oxidising substance.\n\n\n== Formation ==\nThe anhydrous salt can be made from zirconium tetrachloride reacting with dinitrogen pentoxide.\nZrCl4 + 4 N2O5 \u2192 Zr(NO3)4 + 4ClNO2\nThe product can be purified by sublimation in a vacuum.  A contaminating substance in this is nitronium pentanitratozirconate. (NO2)Zr(NO3)5.\nZirconium nitrate pentahydrate Zr(NO3)4\u00b75H2O can be formed by dissolving zirconium dioxide in nitric acid and then evaporating the solution until it is dry.  However it is easier to crystallise zirconyl nitrate trihydrate ZrO(NO3)2\u00b73H2O from such a solution.\nZirconium is highly resistant to nitric acid even in the presence of other impurities and high temperatures. So zirconium nitrate is not made by dissolving zirconium metal in nitric acid.\n\n\n== Properties ==\nZirconium nitrate pentahydrate dissolves easily in water and alcohol. It is acidic in aqueous solution, and a base such as ammonium hydroxide will cause zirconium hydroxide to precipitate. The pentahydrate crystals have a refractive index of 1.6.\n\n\n== Related substances ==\nRelated substances are zirconium nitrate complexes. Zr(NO3)3(H2O)+3 has a tricapped trigonal prismatic structure, with the nitrates connected by two oxygen atoms each (bidentate).  The pentanitrato complex Zr(NO3)\u22125 has all the nitrate groups bidentate, and has a bicapped square antiprism shape.\nNO2[Zr(NO3)3\u00b73H2O]2(NO3)3 crystallizes in the hexagonal system, space group P3c1, with unit cell dimensions a = 10.292 \u00c5, b = 10.292 \u00c5, c = 14.84 \u00c5, volume 1632.2 \u00c53 with 2 formulae per unit cell, density = 2.181.\nCsZr(NO3)5 crystallizes in the monoclinic system, space group P21/n, with unit cell dimensions a = 7.497 \u00c5, b = 11.567 \u00c5, c = 14.411 \u00c5, \u03b2=96.01\u00b0, volume 1242.8 \u00c53 with 4 formulae per cell, density = 2.855.\n(NH4)Zr(NO3)5\u00b7HNO3  crystallizes in the orthorhombic system, space group Pna21 with unit cell dimensions a=14.852 \u00c5, b = 7.222 \u00c5, c = 13.177 \u00c5, volume 1413.6 \u00c53 with 4 formulae per cell, density = 2.267. \nA mixed nitronium, nitrosonium pentanitratozirconate crystallizing in the tetragonal system also exists.\n\n\n== Use ==\nZirconium nitrate is manufactured by a number of chemical suppliers. It is used as a source of zirconium for other salts, as an analytical standard, or as a preservative. Zirconium nitrate and nitronium pentanitratozirconate can be used as chemical vapour deposition precursors as they are volatile, and decompose above 100 \u00b0C to form zirconia. At 95 \u00b0C, zirconium nitrate sublimes with a pressure of 0.2 mm of Hg and can be deposited as zirconium dioxide on silicon at 285 \u00b0C. It has the advantage in that it is a single source, meaning it does not have to be mixed with other materials like oxygen, and decomposes at a relatively low temperature, and does not contaminate the surface with other elements such as hydrogen or fluorine.\nZirconium free from hafnium is required for nuclear reactor construction. One way to achieve this is via a mixed aqueous solution of hafnium nitrate and zirconium nitrate, which can be separated by partitioning the zirconium into tributylphosphate dissolved in kerosene.  \nZirconium nitrate can be used as a Lewis acid catalyst in the formation of N-substituted pyrroles.\nAnhydrous zirconium nitrate can nitrate some organic aromatic compounds in an unusual way.  Quinoline is nitrated to 3-nitroquinoline and 7-nitroquinoline. Pyridine is nitrated to 3-nitropyridine and 4-nitropyridine.\n\n\n== References ==\nZirconium diboride (ZrB2) is a highly covalent refractory ceramic material with a hexagonal crystal structure.  ZrB2 is an ultra-high temperature ceramic (UHTC) with a melting point of 3246 \u00b0C. This along with its relatively low density of ~6.09 g/cm3 (measured density may be higher due to hafnium impurities) and good high temperature strength makes it a candidate for high temperature aerospace applications such as hypersonic flight or rocket propulsion systems.  It is an unusual ceramic, having relatively high thermal and electrical conductivities, properties it shares with isostructural titanium diboride and hafnium diboride.\nZrB2 parts are usually hot pressed (pressure applied to the heated powder) and then machined to shape. Sintering of ZrB2 is hindered by the material's covalent nature and presence of surface oxides which increase grain coarsening before densification during sintering.  Pressureless sintering of ZrB2 is possible with sintering additives such as boron carbide and carbon which react with the surface oxides to increase the driving force for sintering but mechanical properties are degraded compared to hot pressed ZrB2.\nAdditions of ~30 vol% SiC to ZrB2 is often added to ZrB2 to improve oxidation resistance through SiC creating a protective oxide layer - similar to aluminium's protective alumina layer.\nZrB2 is used in ultra-high temperature ceramic matrix composites (UHTCMCs).\nCarbon fiber reinforced zirconium diboride composites show high toughness while silicon carbide fiber reinforced zirconium diboride composites are brittle and show a catastrophic failure.\n\n\n== Preparation ==\nZrB2 can be synthesized by stoichiometric reaction between constituent elements, in this case Zr and B. This reaction provides for precise stoichiometric control of the materials. At 2000 K, the formation of ZrB2 via stoichiometric reaction is thermodynamically favorable (\u0394G=\u2212279.6 kJ mol\u22121) and therefore, this route can be used to produce ZrB2 by self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS). This technique takes advantage of the high exothermic energy of the reaction to cause high temperature, fast combustion reactions. Advantages of SHS include higher purity of ceramic products, increased sinterability, and shorter processing times. However, the extremely rapid heating rates can result in incomplete reactions between Zr and B, the formation of stable oxides of Zr, and the retention of porosity. Stoichiometric reactions have also been carried out by reaction of attrition milled (wearing materials by grinding) Zr and B powder (and then hot pressing at 600 \u00b0C for 6 h), and nanoscale particles have been obtained by reacting attrition milled Zr and B precursor crystallites (10 nm in size).\nReduction of ZrO2 and HfO2 to their respective diborides can also be achieved via metallothermic reduction. Inexpensive precursor materials are used and reacted according to the reaction below:\n\nZrO2 + B2O3 + 5Mg \u2192 ZrB2 + 5MgO\nMg is used as a reactant to allow for acid leaching of unwanted oxide products. Stoichiometric excesses of Mg and B2O3 are often required during metallothermic reductions to consume all available ZrO2. These reactions are exothermic and can be used to produce the diborides by SHS. Production of ZrB2 from ZrO2 via SHS often leads to incomplete conversion of reactants, and therefore double SHS (DSHS) has been employed by some researchers. A second SHS reaction with Mg and H3BO3 as reactants along with the ZrB2/ZrO2 mixture yields increased conversion to the diboride, and particle sizes of 25\u201340 nm at 800 \u00b0C. After metallothermic reduction and DSHS reactions, MgO can be separated from ZrB2 by mild acid leaching.\nSynthesis of UHTCs by boron carbide reduction is one of the most popular methods for UHTC synthesis. The precursor materials for this reaction (ZrO2/TiO2/HfO2 and B4C) are less expensive than those required by the stoichiometric and borothermic reactions. ZrB2 is prepared at greater than 1600 \u00b0C for at least 1 hour by\nAluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly is the INCI name for a preparation used as an antiperspirant in many deodorant products. It is selected for its ability to obstruct pores in the skin and prevent sweat from leaving the body.  Its anhydrous form gives it the added ability of absorbing moisture. It is sometimes called AZG, and contains a mixture of  monomeric and polymeric Zr4+ and Al3+ complexes with hydroxide, chloride and glycine.\n\n\n== Functions ==\nAnhydrous aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly functions by diffusing into the sweat gland and forming a colloidal \"plug\" which limits the flow of sweat to the skin surface. The plug is gradually broken down and normal sweating resumes.\n\n\n== Clothing stains ==\nWhen mixed with sweat, aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly is thought to stain clothing with a yellowish tint.  It can also cause a stiffening of the affected areas of clothing. If excessive amounts of aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly mixed with sweat come in contact with a material, bleach marks may develop.\nExcessive deposits of aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly on clothing may also be removed during washing by adding a chelating agent (such as citric acid from lemon juice) to the wash.\n\n\n== References ==\nZirconium hydride describes an alloy made by combining zirconium and hydrogen. Hydrogen acts as a hardening agent, preventing dislocations in the zirconium atom crystal lattice from sliding past one another. Varying the amount of hydrogen and the form of its presence in the zirconium hydride (precipitated phase) controls qualities such as the hardness, ductility, and tensile strength of the resulting zirconium hydride. Zirconium hydride with increased hydrogen content can be made harder and stronger than zirconium, but such zirconium hydride is also less ductile than zirconium.\n\n\n== Material properties ==\nZirconium is found in the Earth's crust only in the form of an ore, usually a zirconium silicate, such as zircon. Zirconium is extracted from zirconium ore by removing the oxygen and silica. This process, known as the Kroll process, was first applied to titanium. The Kroll process results in an alloy containing hafnium. The hafnium and other impurities are removed in a subsequent step. Zirconium hydride is created by combining refined zirconium with hydrogen. Like titanium, solid zirconium dissolves hydrogen quite readily.\nThe density of zirconium hydride varies based the hydrogen and ranges between 5.56 and 6.52 g cm\u22123.\nEven in the narrow range of concentrations which make up zirconium hydride, mixtures of hydrogen and zirconium can form a number of different structures, with very different properties. Understanding such properties is essential to making quality zirconium hydride. At room temperature, the most stable form of zirconium is the hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure \u03b1-zirconium. It is a fairly soft metallic material that can dissolve only a small concentration of hydrogen, no more than 0.069 wt% at 550 \u00b0C. If zirconium hydride contains more than 0.069% hydrogen at zirconium hydride making temperatures then it transforms into a body-centred cubic (BCC) structure called \u03b2-zirconium. It can dissolve considerably more hydrogen, more than 1.2% hydrogen above 900 \u00b0C.\nWhen zirconium hydrides with less than 0.7% hydrogen, known as hypoeutectoid zirconium hydride, are cooled from the \u03b2 phase the mixture attempts to revert to the \u03b1 phase, resulting in an excess of hydrogen.\nAnother polymorphic form is the \u03b3 phase, is generally accepted to be a metastable phase.\n\nZirconium hydrides are odorless, dark gray to black metallic powders.\nThey behave as usual metals in terms of electrical conductivity and magnetic properties (paramagnetic, unless contaminated with ferromagnetic impurities). Their structure and composition is stable at ambient conditions. Similar to other metal hydrides, different crystalline phases of zirconium hydrides are conventionally labeled with Greek letters, and \u03b1 is reserved for the metal. The known ZrHx phases are \u03b3 (x = 1),  \u03b4 (x = 1.5\u20131.65) and \u03b5 (x = 1.75\u20132). Fractional x values often correspond to mixtures, so the compositions with x = 0.8\u20131.5 usually contain a mixture of \u03b1, \u03b3 and \u03b4 phases, and \u03b4 and \u03b5 phases coexist for x = 1.65\u20131.75. As a function of increasing x, the transition between \u03b4-Zr and \u03b5-Zr is observed as a gradual distortion of the face-centered cubic \u03b4 (fluorite-type) to face-centered tetragonal \u03b5 lattice. This distortion is accompanied by a rapid decrease in Vickers hardness, which is constant at 260 HV for x < 1.6, linearly decreases to 160 HV for 1.6 < x < 1.75 and stabilizes at about 160 HV for 1.75 < x < 2.0. This hardness decrease is accompanied by the decrease in magnetic susceptibility. The mass density behaves differently with the increasing hydrogen content: it decreases linearly from 6.52 to 5.66 g/cm3 for x = 0\u20131.6 and changes little for x = 1.6\u20132.0.\n\n\n== Preparation and chemical properties ==\nZirconium hydrides form upon interaction of the metal with hydrogen gas. Whereas this reaction occurs even at room temperature, homogeneous bulk hydrogenation is usually achieved by annealing at temperatures of 400\u2013600 \u00b0C for a period between several hours and a few weeks. At room te\nZirconium (IV) hydroxide,  often called hydrous zirconia is an ill-defined material or family of materials variously described as ZrO2\u00b7nH2O and Zr(OH)4\u00b7nH2O.  All are white solids with low solubility in water.  These materials are widely employed in the preparation of solid acid catalysts.\nThese materials are generated by mild base hydrolysis of zirconium halides and nitrates.  A typical precursor is zirconium oxychloride.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Zirconium(IV) hydroxide - MSDS\". Sigma-Aldrich.\nGroup 4 is the second group of transition metals in the periodic table. It contains the four elements titanium (Ti), zirconium (Zr), hafnium (Hf), and rutherfordium (Rf). The group is also called the titanium group or titanium family after its lightest member.\nAs is typical for early transition metals, zirconium and hafnium have only the group oxidation state of +4 as a major one, and are quite electropositive and have a less rich coordination chemistry. Due to the effects of the lanthanide contraction, they are very similar in properties. Titanium is somewhat distinct due to its smaller size: it has a well-defined +3 state as well (although +4 is more stable).\nAll the group 4 elements are hard, refractory metals. Their inherent reactivity is completely masked due to the formation of a dense oxide layer that protects them from corrosion, as well as attack by many acids and alkalis. The first three of them occur naturally. Rutherfordium is strongly radioactive: it does not occur naturally and must be produced by artificial synthesis, but its observed and theoretically predicted properties are consistent with it being a heavier homologue of hafnium. None of them have any biological role.\n\n\n== History ==\nZircon was known as a gemstone from ancient times, but it was not known to contain a new element until the work of German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth in 1789. He analysed the zircon-containing mineral jargoon and found a new earth (oxide), but was unable to isolate the element from its oxide. Cornish chemist Humphry Davy also attempted to isolate this new element in 1808 through electrolysis, but failed: he gave it the name zirconium. In 1824, Swedish chemist J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius isolated an impure form of zirconium, obtained by heating a mixture of potassium and potassium zirconium fluoride in an iron tube.\nCornish mineralogist William Gregor first identified titanium in ilmenite sand beside a stream in Cornwall, Great Britain in the year 1791. After analyzing the sand, he determined the weakly magnetic sand to contain iron oxide and a metal oxide that he could not identify. During that same year, mineralogist Franz Joseph Muller produced the same metal oxide and could not identify it. In 1795, chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth independently rediscovered the metal oxide in rutile from the Hungarian village Boinik. He identified the oxide containing a new element and named it for the Titans of Greek mythology. Berzelius was also the first to prepare titanium metal (albeit impurely), doing so in 1825.\nThe X-ray spectroscopy done by Henry Moseley in 1914 showed a direct dependency between spectral line and effective nuclear charge. This led to the nuclear charge, or atomic number of an element, being used to ascertain its place within the periodic table. With this method, Moseley determined the number of lanthanides and showed that there was a missing element with atomic number 72. This spurred chemists to look for it. Georges Urbain asserted that he found element 72 in the rare earth elements in 1907 and published his results on celtium in 1911. Neither the spectra nor the chemical behavior he claimed matched with the element found later, and therefore his claim was turned down after a long-standing controversy.\nBy early 1923, several physicists and chemists such as Niels Bohr and Charles Rugeley Bury suggested that element 72 should resemble zirconium and therefore was not part of the rare earth elements group. These suggestions were based on Bohr's theories of the atom, the X-ray spectroscopy of Moseley, and the chemical arguments of Friedrich Paneth. Encouraged by this, and by the reappearance in 1922 of Urbain's claims that element 72 was a rare earth element discovered in 1911, Dirk Coster and Georg von Hevesy were motivated to search for the new element in zirconium ores. Hafnium was discovered by the two in 1923 in Copenhagen, Denmark. The place where the discovery took place led to the element being named for the Latin\nZirconium(IV) sulfate is the name for a family of inorganic salts with the formula Zr(SO4)2(H2O)n where n = 0, 4, 5, 7. These species are related by the degree of hydration.  They are white or colourless solids that are soluble in water.\n\n\n== Preparation and structure ==\nZirconium sulfate is prepared by the action of sulfuric acid on zirconium oxide:\n\nZrO2  +  2 H2SO4  +  H2O  \u2192   Zr(SO4)2(H2O)x\nThe anhydrous sulfate is also known.\nThese compounds adopt complex structures featuring 7- and 8-coordinated Zr centres.  Both water and sulfate serve as ligands.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nZirconium sulfate is used in tanning white leather, as a catalyst support, to precipitate proteins and amino acids, and as a pigment stabilizer.\n\n\n== References ==\nZirconium carbide (ZrC) is an extremely hard refractory ceramic material, commercially used in tool bits for cutting tools. It is usually processed by sintering.\n\n\n== Properties ==\n\nIt appears as a gray metallic powder with cubic crystal structure. It is highly corrosion resistant. This Group IV interstitial transition-metal carbide is also a member of ultra high temperature ceramics or (UHTC). Due to the presence of metallic bonding, ZrC has a thermal conductivity of 20.5 W/m\u00b7K and an electrical conductivity (resistivity ~43 \u03bc\u03a9\u00b7cm), both of which are similar to that for zirconium metal. The strong covalent Zr-C bond gives this material a very high melting point (~3530 \u00b0C), high modulus (~440 GPa) and hardness (25 GPa). ZrC has a lower density (6.73 g/cm3) compared to other carbides like WC (15.8 g/cm3), TaC (14.5 g/cm3) or HfC (12.67 g/cm3). ZrC seems suitable for use in re-entry vehicles, rocket/scramjet engines or supersonic vehicles in which low densities and high temperatures load-bearing capabilities are crucial requirements.\nLike most carbides of refractory metals, zirconium carbide is sub-stoichiometric, i.e., it contains carbon vacancies. At carbon contents higher than approximately ZrC0.98 the material contains free carbon.  ZrC is stable for a carbon-to-metal ratio ranging from 0.65 to 0.98.\nThe group IVA metal carbides, TiC, ZrC, and SiC are practically inert toward attack by strong aqueous acids (HCl) and strong aqueous bases (NaOH) even at 100' C, however, ZrC does react with HF.\nThe mixture of zirconium carbide and tantalum carbide is an important cermet material.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nHafnium-free zirconium carbide and niobium carbide can be used as refractory coatings in nuclear reactors. Because of a low neutron absorption cross-section and weak damage sensitivity under irradiation, it finds use as the coating of uranium dioxide and thorium dioxide particles of nuclear fuel. The coating is usually deposited by thermal chemical vapor deposition in a fluidized bed reactor. It also has high emissivity and high current capacity at elevated temperatures rendering it as a promising material for use in thermo-photovoltaic radiators and field emitter tips and arrays.\nIt is also used as an abrasive, in cladding, in cermets, incandescent filaments and cutting tools.\n\n\n== Production ==\nZirconium carbide can be fabricated in several ways. One method is carbothermic reaction of zirconia by graphite. This results in a powder. Densified ZrC can then be made by sintering the powder of ZrC at upwards of 2000 \u00b0C. Hot pressing of ZrC can bring down the sintering temperature and consequently helps in producing fine grained fully densified ZrC. Spark plasma sintering also has been used to produce fully densified ZrC.\nZirconium carbide can also be fabricated by solution based processing. This is achieved by refluxing a metal oxide with acetylacetone.\nAnother method of fabrication is chemical vapour deposition. This is achieved by heating a zirconium sponge and parsing halide gas through it.\nPoor oxidation resistance over 800 \u00b0C limits the applications of ZrC. One way to improve the oxidation resistance of ZrC is to make composites. Important composites proposed are ZrC-ZrB2 and ZrC-ZrB2-SiC composite. These composites can work up to 1800 \u00b0C. Another method to improve this is to use another material as a barrier layer such as in TRISO fuel particles.\n\n\n== References ==\nZircon () is a mineral belonging to the group of nesosilicates and is a source of the metal zirconium. Its chemical name is zirconium(IV) silicate, and its corresponding chemical formula is ZrSiO4. An empirical formula showing some of the range of substitution in zircon is (Zr1\u2013y, REEy)(SiO4)1\u2013x(OH)4x\u2013y. Zircon precipitates from silicate melts and has relatively high concentrations of high field strength incompatible elements. For example, hafnium is almost always present in quantities ranging from 1 to 4%. The crystal structure of zircon is tetragonal crystal system. The natural color of zircon varies between colorless, yellow-golden, red, brown, blue, and green.\nThe name derives from the Persian zargun, meaning \"gold-hued\". This word is changed into \"jargoon\", a term applied to light-colored zircons. The English word \"zircon\" is derived from Zirkon, which is the German adaptation of this word. Yellow, orange, and red zircon is also known as \"hyacinth\", from the flower hyacinthus, whose name is of Ancient Greek origin.\n\n\n== Properties ==\n\nZircon is common in the crust of Earth. It occurs as a common accessory mineral in igneous rocks (as primary crystallization products), in metamorphic rocks and as detrital grains in sedimentary rocks. Large zircon crystals are rare. Their average size in granite rocks is about 0.1\u20130.3 mm (0.0039\u20130.0118 in), but they can also grow to sizes of several cm, especially in mafic pegmatites and carbonatites. Zircon is fairly hard (with a Mohs hardness of 7.5) and chemically stable, and so is highly resistant to weathering. It also is resistant to heat, so that detrital zircon grains are sometimes preserved in igneous rocks formed from melted sediments. Its resistance to weathering, together with its relatively high specific gravity (4.68), make it an important component of the heavy mineral fraction of sandstones.\nBecause of their uranium and thorium content, some zircons undergo metamictization. Connected to internal radiation damage, these processes partially disrupt the crystal structure and partly explain the highly variable properties of zircon. As zircon becomes more and more modified by internal radiation damage, the density decreases, the crystal structure is compromised, and the color changes.\nZircon occurs in many colors, including reddish brown, yellow, green, blue, gray, and colorless. The color of zircons can sometimes be changed by heat treatment. Common brown zircons can be transformed into colorless and blue zircons by heating to 800 to 1,000 \u00b0C (1,470 to 1,830 \u00b0F). In geological settings, the development of pink, red, and purple zircon occurs after hundreds of millions of years, if the crystal has sufficient trace elements to produce color centers. Color in this red or pink series is annealed in geological conditions above temperatures of around 400 \u00b0C (752 \u00b0F).\nStructurally, zircon consists of parallel chains of alternating silica tetrahedra (silicon ions in fourfold coordination with oxygen ions) and zirconium ions, with the large zirconium ions in eightfold coordination with oxygen ions.\n\n\n== Applications ==\n\nZircon is mainly consumed as an opacifier, and has been known to be used in the decorative ceramics industry. It is also the principal precursor not only to metallic zirconium, although this application is small, but also to all compounds of zirconium including zirconium dioxide (ZrO2), an important refractory oxide with a melting point of 2,717 \u00b0C (4,923 \u00b0F).\nOther applications include use in refractories and foundry casting and a growing array of specialty applications as zirconia and zirconium chemicals, including in nuclear fuel rods, catalytic fuel converters and in water and air purification systems.\nZircon is one of the key minerals used by geologists for geochronology.\nZircon is a part of the ZTR index to classify highly-weathered sediments.\n\n\n== Gemstone ==\n\nTransparent zircon is a well-known form of semi-precious gemstone, favored for its high specific gravity (b\nHafnium is a chemical element; it has symbol Hf and atomic number 72. A lustrous, silvery gray, tetravalent transition metal, hafnium chemically resembles zirconium and is found in many zirconium minerals. Its existence was predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, though it was not identified until 1922, by Dirk Coster and George de Hevesy. Hafnium is named after Hafnia, the Latin name for Copenhagen, where it was discovered.\nHafnium is used in filaments and electrodes.  Some semiconductor fabrication processes use its oxide for integrated circuits at 45 nanometers and smaller feature lengths. Some superalloys used for special applications contain hafnium in combination with niobium, titanium, or tungsten.\nHafnium's large neutron capture cross section makes it a good material for neutron absorption in control rods in nuclear power plants, but at the same time requires that it be removed from the neutron-transparent corrosion-resistant zirconium alloys used in nuclear reactors.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Physical characteristics ===\n\nHafnium is a shiny, silvery, ductile metal that is corrosion-resistant and chemically similar to zirconium in that they have the same number of valence electrons and are in the same group. Also, their relativistic effects are similar: The expected expansion of atomic radii from period 5 to 6 is almost exactly canceled out by the lanthanide contraction. Hafnium changes from its alpha form, a hexagonal close-packed lattice, to its beta form, a body-centered cubic lattice, at 2388 K.  The physical properties of hafnium metal samples are markedly affected by zirconium impurities, especially the nuclear properties, as these two elements are among the most difficult to separate because of their chemical similarity.\nA notable physical difference between these metals is their density, with zirconium having about one-half the density of hafnium. The most notable nuclear properties of hafnium are its high thermal neutron capture cross section and that the nuclei of several different hafnium isotopes readily absorb two or more neutrons apiece. In contrast with this, zirconium is practically transparent to thermal neutrons, and it is commonly used for the metal components of nuclear reactors\u2014especially the cladding of their nuclear fuel rods.\n\n\n=== Chemical characteristics ===\n\nHafnium reacts in air to form a protective film that inhibits further corrosion.  Despite this, the metal is attacked by hydrofluoric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid, and can be oxidized with halogens or burnt in air.  Like its sister metal zirconium, finely divided hafnium can ignite spontaneously in air. The metal is resistant to concentrated alkalis.\nAs a consequence of lanthanide contraction, the chemistry of hafnium and zirconium is so similar that the two cannot be separated based on differing chemical reactions. The melting and boiling points of the compounds and the solubility in solvents are the major differences in the chemistry of these twin elements.\n\n\n=== Isotopes ===\n\nAt least 40 isotopes of hafnium have been observed, ranging in mass number from 153 to 192. The five stable isotopes have mass numbers ranging from 176 to 180 inclusive. The radioactive isotopes' half-lives range from 400 ms for 153Hf to 7.0\u00d71016 years for the most stable one, the primordial 174Hf.\nThe extinct radionuclide 182Hf has a half-life of 8.9\u00b10.1 million years, and is an important tracker isotope for the formation of planetary cores. The nuclear isomer 178m2Hf was at the center of a controversy for several years regarding its potential use as a weapon.\n\n\n=== Occurrence ===\n\nHafnium is estimated to make up about between 3.0 and 4.8 ppm of the Earth's upper crust by mass.:\u200a5\u200a  It does not exist as a free element on Earth, but is found combined in solid solution with zirconium in natural zirconium compounds such as zircon, ZrSiO4, which usually has about 1\u20134% of the Zr replaced by Hf. Rarely, the Hf/Zr ratio increases during crystallization to give\nSodium zirconium cyclosilicate, sold under the brand name Lokelma, is a medication used to treat high blood potassium. Onset of effects occurs in one to six hours. It is taken by mouth.\nCommon side effects include swelling and low blood potassium. Use is likely safe in pregnancy and breastfeeding. It works by binding potassium ions in the gastrointestinal tract which is then lost in the stool.\nSodium zirconium cyclosilicate was approved for medical use in the European Union and in the United States in 2018. It was developed by AstraZeneca.\n\n\n== Medical use ==\nSodium zirconium cyclosilicate is used to treat high blood potassium. Onset of effects occurs in one to six hours.\n\n\n== Mechanism of action ==\n\nZS-9 is a zirconium silicate. Zirconium silicates have been extensively used in medical and dental applications because of their proven safety. 11 zirconium silicates were screened by an iterative optimization process. ZS-9 selectively captures potassium ions, presumably by mimicking the actions of physiologic potassium channels. ZS-9 is an inorganic cation exchanger crystalline with a high capacity to entrap monovalent cations, specifically potassium and ammonium ions, in the GI tract.\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nHyperkalemia is rare among those who are otherwise healthy. Among those who are in hospital, rates are between 1% and 2.5%. Common causes include kidney failure, hypoaldosteronism, and rhabdomyolysis. A number of medications can also cause high blood potassium including spironolactone, NSAIDs, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.\nThere is no universally accepted definition of what level of hyperkalemia is mild, moderate, or severe. However, if hyperkalemia causes any ECG change it is considered a medical emergency due to a risk of potentially fatal abnormal heart rhythms and is treated urgently. Potassium levels greater than 6.5 to 7.0 mmol/L in the absence of ECG changes are managed aggressively. Several approaches are used to treat hyperkalemia. Other approved potassium binders in the United States include patiromer and sodium polystyrene sulfonate.\nHyperkalemia, particularly if severe, is a marker for an increased risk of death. However, there is disagreement regarding whether a modestly elevated levels directly causes problems. One viewpoint is that mild to moderate hyperkalemia is a secondary effect that denotes underlying medical problems. Accordingly, these problems are both proximate and ultimate causes of death,\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the United States, regulatory approval of ZS-9 was rejected by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 2016, due to issues associated with manufacturing. On 18 May 2018, the FDA approved sodium zirconium cyclosilicate for treatment of adults with hyperkalemia.\nIt was first practically synthesized by UOP in the late 1990s. (reference -zirconium silicate and zirconium germate molecular sieves and the process of using the same, US Patent 5,888,472) the recognition of the unique ion exchange properties and the potential use to remove toxins from the body were identified shortly thereafter (\"process for removing toxins from bodily fluids using zirconium or titanium microporous compositions, US Patent 6,332,985).\n\n\n== Research ==\nOne review found a decrease in potassium of 0.17 mEq/L at one hour and 0.67 mEq/L at 48 hours.\nIt appears effective in people with chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and heart failure. Use has been studied for up to a year.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nCADTH review", "metadata": {"title": "Zirconium", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zirconium"}}
