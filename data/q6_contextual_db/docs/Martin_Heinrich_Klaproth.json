{"page_content": "Martin Heinrich Klaproth (1 December 1743 \u2013 1 January 1817) was a German chemist. He trained and worked for much of his life as an apothecary, moving in later life to the university. His shop became the second-largest apothecary in Berlin, and the most productive artisanal chemical research center in Europe.\nKlaproth was a major systematizer of analytical chemistry, and an independent inventor of gravimetric analysis. His attention to detail and refusal to ignore discrepancies in results led to improvements in the use of apparatus.  He was a major figure in understanding the composition of minerals and characterizing the elements. \nKlaproth discovered uranium (1789) \nand zirconium (1789).  \nHe was also involved in the discovery or co-discovery of \ntitanium (1795), \nstrontium (1793), \ncerium (1803), and  \nchromium (1797) and confirmed the previous discoveries of \ntellurium (1798) and \nberyllium (1798).\nKlaproth was a member and director of  the  Berlin Academy  of  Sciences. He was recognized internationally as a member of the Royal Society in London, the Institut de France, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n\n\n== Career ==\nKlaproth was born in Wernigerode. He was the son of a tailor, and attended the Latin school at Wernigerode for four years.\nFor much of his life he followed the profession of  apothecary. In 1759, when he was 16 years old, he apprenticed at Quedlinburg. In 1764, he became a journeyman. He trained in pharmacies at Quedlinburg (1759\u20131766); Hanover (1766\u20131768, with August Hermann Brande); Berlin (1768); and Danzig (1770).\nIn 1771, Klaproth returned to Berlin to work for Valentin Rose the Elder as manager of his business. Following Rose's death, Klaproth passed the required examinations to become senior manager.  Following his marriage in 1780, he was able to buy his own establishment, the Apotheke zum Baren. Between 1782 and 1800, Klaproth published 84 papers based on researches carried out in the Apotheke's laboratory. His shop was the most productive site of artisanal chemistry investigations in Europe at that time.\nBeginning in 1782, he was the assessor of pharmacy for the examining board of the Ober-Collegium Medicum. In 1787 Klaproth was appointed lecturer in chemistry to the Prussian Royal Artillery.\nIn 1788, Klaproth became an unsalaried member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences. In 1800, he became the salaried director of the Berlin Academy of Sciences.  He sold the apothecary and moved to the academy, where he convinced the university to build a new laboratory. Upon completion in 1802, Klaproth moved the equipment from his apothecary laboratory into the new building.\nWhen the University of Berlin was founded in 1810 he was selected to be the professor of chemistry.\nHe died in Berlin on New Year's Day in 1817.\n\n\n== Contributions ==\n\nAn exact and conscientious worker, Klaproth did much to improve and systematise the processes of analytical chemistry and mineralogy. His appreciation of the value of quantitative methods led him to become one of the earliest adherents of the Lavoisierian doctrines outside France.\nKlaproth was the first to discover uranium, identifying it first in torbernite but doing the majority of his research on it with the mineral pitchblende. \nOn 24 September 1789 he announced his discovery to the Royal Prussian Academy of sciences in Berlin. He also discovered zirconium in 1789, separating it in the form of its \u201cearth\u201d zirconia, oxide ZrO2. Klaproth analyzed a brightly-colored form of the mineral called \"hyacinth\" from Ceylon. He gave the new element the name zirconium based on its Persian name \"zargun\", gold-colored.:\u200a515\u200a\nKlaproth characterised uranium and zirconium as distinct elements, though he was unable to isolate them.\nKlaproth independently discovered  cerium (1803), a rare earth element, around the same time as J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger, in the winter of 1803.\nWilliam Gregor of Cornwall was the first to identify the element titanium in 1791, correctly c\nKlaproth is a German surname. Notable people with the surname include:\n\nMartin Heinrich Klaproth (1743\u20131817), German chemist\nKlaproth (crater), lunar crater named after Martin Heinrich Klaproth\nJulius Klaproth (1783\u20131835), German linguist, historian, ethnographer, author, Orientalist and explorer\nStephan Klapproth (born 1958), a Swiss journalist and television presenter\nUranium is a chemical element with the symbol U and atomic number 92. It is a silvery-grey metal in the actinide series of the periodic table. A uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons, of which 6 are valence electrons. Uranium radioactively decays, usually by emitting an alpha particle. The half-life of this decay varies between 159,200 and 4.5 billion years for different isotopes, making them useful for dating the age of the Earth. The most common isotopes in natural uranium are uranium-238 (which has 146 neutrons and accounts for over 99% of uranium on Earth) and uranium-235 (which has 143 neutrons). Uranium has the highest atomic weight of the primordially occurring elements. Its density is about 70% higher than that of lead and slightly lower than that of gold or tungsten. It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few parts per million in soil, rock and water, and is commercially extracted from uranium-bearing minerals such as uraninite.\nMany contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique nuclear properties. Uranium-235 is the only naturally occurring fissile isotope, which makes it widely used in nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons. However, because of the low abundance of uranium-235 in natural uranium (which is, overwhelmingly, mostly uranium-238), uranium needs to undergo enrichment so that enough uranium-235 is present. Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons and is fertile, meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor. Another fissile isotope, uranium-233, can be produced from natural thorium and is studied for future industrial use in nuclear technology. Uranium-238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons; uranium-235, and to a lesser degree uranium-233, have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons.  The primary civilian use for uranium harnesses the heat energy to produce electricity. Depleted uranium (238U) is used in kinetic energy penetrators and armor plating.\nThe 1789 discovery of uranium in the mineral pitchblende is credited to Martin Heinrich Klaproth, who named the new element after the recently discovered planet Uranus. Eug\u00e8ne-Melchior P\u00e9ligot was the first person to isolate the metal, and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by Henri Becquerel. Research by Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, Enrico Fermi and others, such as J. Robert Oppenheimer starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in the nuclear power industry and in Little Boy, the first nuclear weapon used in war. An ensuing arms race during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium-derived plutonium-239. Dismantling of these weapons and related nuclear facilities is carried out within various nuclear disarmament programs and costs billions of dollars. Weapon-grade uranium obtained from nuclear weapons is diluted with uranium-238 and reused as fuel for nuclear reactors. Spent nuclear fuel forms radioactive waste, which mostly consists of uranium-238 and poses a significant health threat and environmental impact.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nUranium is a silvery white, weakly radioactive metal. It has a Mohs hardness of 6, sufficient to scratch glass and roughly equal to that of titanium, rhodium, manganese and niobium. It is malleable, ductile, slightly paramagnetic, strongly electropositive and a poor electrical conductor. Uranium metal has a very high density of 19.1 g/cm3, denser than lead (11.3 g/cm3), but slightly less dense than tungsten and gold (19.3 g/cm3).\nUranium metal reacts with almost all non-metallic elements (except noble gases) and their compounds, with reactivity increasing with temperature. Hydrochloric and nitric acids dissol\nCerium is a chemical element; it has symbol Ce and atomic number 58. It is a soft, ductile, and silvery-white metal that tarnishes when exposed to air. Cerium is the second element in the lanthanide series, and while it often shows the oxidation state of +3 characteristic of the series, it also has a stable +4 state that does not oxidize water. It is considered one of the rare-earth elements. Cerium has no known biological role in humans but is not particularly toxic, except with intense or continued exposure.\nDespite always occurring in combination with the other rare-earth elements in minerals such as those of the monazite and bastn\u00e4site groups, cerium is easy to extract from its ores, as it can be distinguished among the lanthanides by its unique ability to be oxidized to the +4 state in aqueous solution. It is the most common of the lanthanides, followed by neodymium, lanthanum, and praseodymium. Its estimated abundance in the Earth's crust is 68 ppm.\nCerium was the first of the lanthanides to be discovered, in Bastn\u00e4s, Sweden. It was discovered by J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger in 1803, and independently by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in Germany in the same year. In 1839 Carl Gustaf Mosander became the first to isolate the metal. Today, cerium and its compounds have a variety of uses: for example, cerium(IV) oxide is used to polish glass and is an important part of catalytic converters. Cerium metal is used in ferrocerium lighters for its pyrophoric properties. Cerium-doped YAG phosphor is used in conjunction with blue light-emitting diodes to produce white light in most commercial white LED light sources.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Physical ===\nCerium is the second element of the lanthanide series. In the periodic table, it appears between the lanthanides lanthanum to its left and praseodymium to its right, and above the actinide thorium. It is a ductile metal with a hardness similar to that of silver. Its 58 electrons are arranged in the configuration [Xe]4f15d16s2, of which the four outer electrons are valence electrons. The 4f, 5d, and 6s energy levels are very close to each other, and the transfer of one electron to the 5d shell is due to strong interelectronic repulsion in the compact 4f shell. This effect is overwhelmed when the atom is positively ionised; thus Ce2+ on its own has instead the regular configuration [Xe]4f2, although in some solid solutions it may be [Xe]4f15d1. Most lanthanides can use only three electrons as valence electrons, as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: cerium is an exception because of the stability of the empty f-shell in Ce4+ and the fact that it comes very early in the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough until neodymium to allow the removal of the fourth valence electron by chemical means.\nCerium has a variable electronic structure. The energy of the 4f electron is nearly the same as that of the outer 5d and 6s electrons that are delocalized in the metallic state, and only a small amount of energy is required to change the relative occupancy of these electronic levels. This gives rise to dual valence states. For example, a volume change of about 10% occurs when cerium is subjected to high pressures or low temperatures. In its high pressure phase (\u03b1-Cerium), the 4f electrons are also delocalized and itinerate, as opposed to localized 4f electrons in low pressure phase (\u03b3-Cerium). It appears that the valence changes from about 3 to 4 when it is cooled or compressed.\n\n\n=== Chemical properties of the element ===\nLike the other lanthanides, cerium metal is a good reducing agent, having standard reduction potential of E\u29b5 = \u22122.34 V for the Ce3+/Ce couple. It tarnishes in air, forming a passivating oxide layer like iron rust. A centimeter-sized sample of cerium metal corrodes completely in about a year. More dramatically, metallic cerium can be highly pyrophoric: \n\nCe + O2 \u2192 CeO2\nBeing highly electropositive, cerium reacts wit\nKlaproth is an old lunar impact crater that lies in the rugged southern highlands of the Moon's near side. Due to its location, this crater appears significantly foreshortened when viewed from the Earth. The southern rim of the crater is overlain by the similar-sized crater Casatus, and to the north-northeast lies Blancanus.\nThe outer rim of Klaproth has been deeply eroded, incised, and reshaped by a long history of bombardment. The rim to the north and east remains relatively circular, but the original rim along the western face has been overlain by satellite craters Klaproth G and Klaproth H, and other impacts. To the south the crater Casatus significantly intrudes into the interior floor. The remaining floor has been resurfaced by some material in the past, possibly fluidized ejecta or lava, leaving a level and nearly featureless surface that is marked only by a multitude of tiny craterlets. If this walled-plain once possessed a central peak, it no longer exists.\nThe crater was named after Martin Heinrich Klaproth, the German chemist and discoverer of Uranium.\n\n\n== Satellite craters ==\nBy convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Klaproth.\n\n\n== References ==\nWood, Chuck (2006-08-05). \"Unknown Klaproth\".

Found in nature only as an oxide, it can be reduced to produce a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density, and high strength, resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia, and chlorine.\nTitanium was discovered in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791 and was named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth after the Titans of Greek mythology. The element occurs within a number of minerals, principally rutile and ilmenite, which are widely distributed in the Earth's crust and lithosphere; it is found in almost all living things, as well as bodies of water, rocks, and soils. The metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores by the Kroll and Hunter processes. The most common compound, titanium dioxide, is a popular photocatalyst and is used in the manufacture of white pigments. Other compounds include titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), a component of smoke screens and catalysts; and titanium trichloride (TiCl3), which is used as a catalyst in the production of polypropylene.\nTitanium can be alloyed with iron, aluminium, vanadium, and molybdenum, among other elements. The resulting titanium alloys are strong, lightweight, and versatile, with applications including aerospace (jet engines, missiles, and spacecraft), military, industrial processes (chemicals and petrochemicals, desalination plants, pulp, and paper), automotive, agriculture (farming), sporting goods, jewelry, and consumer electronics. Titanium is also considered one of the most biocompatible metals, leading to a range of medical applications including prostheses, orthopedic implants, dental implants, and surgical instruments.\nThe two most useful properties of the metal are corrosion resistance and strength-to-density ratio, the highest of any metallic element. In its unalloyed condition, titanium is as strong as some steels, but less dense. There are two allotropic forms and five naturally occurring isotopes of this element, 46Ti through 50Ti, with 48Ti being the most abundant (73.8%).\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Physical properties ===\nAs a metal, titanium is recognized for its high strength-to-weight ratio. It is a strong metal with low density that is quite ductile (especially in an oxygen-free environment), lustrous, and metallic-white in color. Due to its relatively high melting point (1,668 \u00b0C or 3,034 \u00b0F) it has sometimes been described as a refractory metal, but this is not the case. It is paramagnetic and has fairly low electrical and thermal conductivity compared to other metals. Titanium is superconducting when cooled below its critical temperature of 0.49 K.\n\nCommercially pure (99.2% pure) grades of titanium have ultimate tensile strength of about 434 MPa (63,000 psi), equal to that of common, low-grade steel alloys, but are less dense. Titanium is 60% denser than aluminium, but more than twice as strong as the most commonly used 6061-T6 aluminium alloy. Certain titanium alloys (e.g., Beta C) achieve tensile strengths of over 1,400 MPa (200,000 psi). However, titanium loses strength when heated above 430 \u00b0C (806 \u00b0F).\nTitanium is not as hard as some grades of heat-treated steel; it is non-magnetic and a poor conductor of heat and electricity. Machining requires precautions, because the material can gall unless sharp tools and proper cooling methods are used. Like steel structures, those made from titanium have a fatigue limit that guarantees longevity in some applications.\nThe metal is a dimorphic allotrope of a hexagonal close packed \u03b1 form that changes into a body-centered cubic (lattice) \u03b2 form at 882 \u00b0C (1,620 \u00b0F). The specific heat of the \u03b1 form increases dramatically as it is heated to this transition temperature but then falls and remains fairly constant for the \u03b2 form regardless of temperature.\n\n\n=== Chemical properties ===\n\nLike aluminium and magnesium, the surface of titanium metal and its alloys oxidize immediately upon exposure to air to form a thin non\nUranium glass is glass which has had uranium, usually in oxide diuranate form, added to a glass mix before melting for colouration. The proportion usually varies from trace levels to about 2% uranium by weight, although some 20th-century pieces were made with up to 25% uranium.\nFirst identified in 1789 by German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth, uranium was soon being added to decorative glass for its fluorescent effect. James Powell's Whitefriars Glass company in London, England, was one of the first to market the glowing glass, but other manufacturers soon realised its sales potential and uranium glass was produced across Europe and later in Ohio.\nUranium glass was once made into tableware and household items, but fell out of widespread use when the availability of uranium to most industries was sharply curtailed during the Cold War in the 1940s to 1990s, with the vast majority of the world's uranium supply being utilised as a strategic material for use in nuclear weapons or nuclear power. Most uranium glass is now considered to be antiques or retro-era collectables, although there has been a minor revival in art glassware. Otherwise, modern uranium glass is now mainly limited to small objects like beads or marbles as scientific or decorative novelties.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe normal colour of uranium glass ranges from yellow to green depending on the oxidation state and concentration of the metal ions, although this may be altered by the addition of other elements as glass colorants. Uranium glass also fluoresces bright green under ultraviolet light.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Vaseline glass ===\nThe most common color of uranium glass is pale yellowish-green, which in the 1930s led to the nickname \"Vaseline glass\", based on a perceived resemblance to the appearance of Vaseline-brand petroleum jelly as formulated at that time. Specialized collectors still define Vaseline glass as transparent or semi-transparent uranium glass in this specific color.\nVaseline glass is sometimes used as a synonym for any uranium glass, especially in the United States, but this usage is frowned upon, since Vaseline-brand petroleum jelly was only yellow, not other colors. The term is sometimes applied to other types of glass based on certain aspects of their superficial appearance in normal light, regardless of actual uranium content which requires a blacklight test to verify the characteristic green fluorescence.\nIn the United Kingdom and Australia, the term Vaseline glass can be used to refer to any type of translucent glass.\n\n\n=== Other colors ===\n\nSeveral other common subtypes of uranium glass have their own nicknames: \n\nCustard glass (opaque or semiopaque pale yellow)\nJadite glass (opaque or semi-opaque pale green; initially, the name was trademarked as \"Jadite\", although this is sometimes over-corrected in modern usage to \"jadeite\")\nDepression glass (transparent or semitransparent pale green).\nBurmese glass (opaque glass that shades from pink to yellow)\nLike \"Vaseline\", the terms \"custard\" and \"jad(e)ite\" are often applied on the basis of superficial appearance rather than uranium content. Conversely, \"Depression glass\" is a general description for any piece of glassware manufactured during the Great Depression regardless of appearance or formula.\n\n\n== Fabrication ==\nUranium glass is used as one of several intermediate glasses in what is known to scientific glass blowers as a 'graded seal'.  This is typically used in glass-to-metal seals such as tungsten and molybdenum or nickel based alloys such as Kovar, as an intermediary glass between the metal sealing glass and lower expansion borosilicate glass.\n\n\n== Usage ==\n\n\n=== Ancient usage ===\nThe use of uranium glass dates back to at least 79 AD, the date of a mosaic containing yellow glass with 1% uranium oxide, which was found in a Roman villa on Cape Posillipo in the Bay of Naples, Italy, in 1912.\n\n\n=== Medieval usage ===\nStarting in the late Middle Ages, pitchblende was extracted from\nTellurium is a chemical element; it has symbol Te and atomic number 52. It is a brittle, mildly toxic, rare, silver-white metalloid. Tellurium is chemically related to selenium and sulfur, all three of which are chalcogens. It is occasionally found in its native form as elemental crystals. Tellurium is far more common in the Universe as a whole than on Earth. Its extreme rarity in the Earth's crust, comparable to that of platinum, is due partly to its formation of a volatile hydride that caused tellurium to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of Earth.\nTellurium-bearing compounds were first discovered in 1782 in a gold mine in Kleinschlatten, Transylvania (now Zlatna, Romania) by Austrian mineralogist Franz-Joseph M\u00fcller von Reichenstein, although it was Martin Heinrich Klaproth who named the new element in 1798 after the Latin tellus 'earth'. Gold telluride minerals are the most notable natural gold compounds. However, they are not a commercially significant source of tellurium itself, which is normally extracted as a by-product of copper and lead production.\nCommercially, the primary use of tellurium is CdTe solar panels and thermoelectric devices. A more traditional application in copper (tellurium copper) and steel alloys, where tellurium improves machinability, also consumes a considerable portion of tellurium production. Tellurium is considered a technology-critical element.\nTellurium has no biological function, although fungi can use it in place of sulfur and selenium in amino acids such as tellurocysteine and telluromethionine. In humans, tellurium is partly metabolized into dimethyl telluride, (CH3)2Te, a gas with a garlic-like odor exhaled in the breath of victims of tellurium exposure or poisoning.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Physical properties ===\nTellurium has two allotropes, crystalline and amorphous. When crystalline, tellurium is silvery-white with a metallic luster. The crystals are trigonal and chiral (space group 152 or 154 depending on the chirality), like the gray form of selenium. It is a brittle and easily pulverized metalloid. Amorphous tellurium is a black-brown powder prepared by precipitating it from a solution of tellurous acid or telluric acid (Te(OH)6). Tellurium is a semiconductor that shows greater electrical conductivity in certain directions depending on atomic alignment; the conductivity increases slightly when exposed to light (photoconductivity). When molten, tellurium is corrosive to copper, iron, and stainless steel. Of the chalcogens (oxygen-family elements), tellurium has the highest melting and boiling points, at 722.66 and 1,261 K (449.51 and 987.85 \u00b0C), respectively.\n\n\n=== Chemical properties ===\nCrystalline tellurium consists of parallel helical chains of Te atoms, with three atoms per turn. This gray material resists oxidation by air and is not volatile.\n\n\n=== Isotopes ===\n\nNaturally occurring tellurium has eight isotopes. Six of those isotopes, 120Te, 122Te, 123Te, 124Te, 125Te, and 126Te, are stable. The other two, 128Te and 130Te, are slightly radioactive, with extremely long half-lives, including 2.2 \u00d7 1024 years for 128Te. This is the longest known half-life among all radionuclides and is about 160 trillion (1012) times the age of the known universe.\nA further 31 artificial radioisotopes of tellurium are known, with atomic masses ranging from 104 to 142 and with half-lives of 19 days or less. Also, 17 nuclear isomers are known, with half-lives up to 154 days. Except for beryllium-8 and beta-delayed alpha emission branches in some lighter nuclides, tellurium (104Te to 109Te) is the second lightest element with isotopes known to undergo alpha decay, antimony being the lightest.\nThe atomic mass of tellurium (127.60 g\u00b7mol\u22121) exceeds that of iodine (126.90 g\u00b7mol\u22121), the next element in the periodic table.\n\n\n=== Occurrence ===\n\nWith an abundance in the Earth's crust comparable to that of platinum (about 1 \u03bcg/kg), tellurium is one of the rarest stable solid \nHeinrich Julius Klaproth (11 October 1783 \u2013 28 August 1835) was a German linguist, historian, ethnographer, author, orientalist and explorer. As a scholar, he is credited along with Jean-Pierre Abel-R\u00e9musat, with being instrumental in turning East Asian Studies into scientific disciplines with critical methods.\n\n\n== Name ==\nH.J. Klaproth was usually known as Julius or Julius von Klaproth. His name also erroneously appears as \"Julius Heinrich Klaproth\".\n\n\n== Life ==\nKlaproth was born in Berlin on 11 October 1783, the son of the chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth, who is credited with the discovery of four elements including uranium.\nYoung Klaproth devoted his energies in quite early life to the study of Asiatic languages, and published in 1802 his Asiatisches Magazin (Weimar 1802\u20131803). He was in consequence called to Saint Petersburg and given an appointment in the academy there. In 1805 he was a member of Count Golovkin's embassy to China. On his return he was despatched by the academy to the Caucasus on an ethnographical and linguistic exploration (1807\u20131808), and was afterwards employed for several years in connection with the academy's Oriental publications. In 1812 he moved to Berlin.\nIn 1815 he settled in Paris, and in 1816 Humboldt procured him from the king of Prussia the title and salary of professor of Asiatic languages and literature, with permission to remain in Paris as long as was requisite for the publication of his works. He died in Paris on 28 August 1835.\nKlaproth was an orientalist or an \"Asiatologist,\" in that he had a good command not only of\nChinese, but also Manchu, Mongolian, Sanskrit, Turkish, Arabic, Persian, and even Caucasian languages. His wide range of interests encompassed the study of the development of individual countries in their Asian context, which contrast with the 21st century focus on specialization.\nKlaproth's 1812 Dissertation on language and script of the Uighurs (Abhandlung \u00fcber die Sprache und Schrift der Uiguren) was disputed by Isaak Jakob Schmidt, who is considered the founder of Mongolian Studies. Klaproth asserted that the Uighur language was a Turkic language, which today is undisputed, while Schmidt was persuaded that Uighur should be classified as a \"Tangut\" language.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\nKlaproth's bibliography extends to more than 300 published items.\nHis great work Asia Polyglotta (Paris, 1823 and 1831, with Sprachatlas) not only served as a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of all that was known on the subject, but formed a new departure for the classification of the Eastern languages, especially those of the Russian Empire.\nThe Itinerary of a Chinese Traveller (1821), a series of documents in the military archives of St. Petersburg purporting to be the travels of \"George Ludwig von \u2014\", and a similar series obtained from him in the London foreign office, are all regarded as spurious.\nKlaproth's other works include:\n\nReise in den Kaukasus und Georgien in den Jahren 1807 und 1808 (Halle, 1812\u20131814; French translation, Paris, 1823)\nGeographisch-historische Beschreibung des ostlichen Kaukasus (Weimar 1814)\nTableaux historiques de l'Asie (Paris, 1826)\nMemoires relatifs a l'Asie (Paris, 1824\u20131828)\nTableau historique, geographique, ethnographique et politique de Caucase (Paris, 1827)\nVocabulaire et grammaire de la langue georgienne (Paris, 1827)\nKlaproth was also the first to publish a translation of Taika era Japanese poetry in the West.

It crystallizes in fine silky needles and is soluble in water and alcohol.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe stable conformation of this molecule has the carboxylic acid groups rotated out of the plane of the central benzene ring. The molecule adopts a propeller-like conformation in which the tilt of each carboxylic acid group relative to the central benzene ring varies due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding.\n\n\n== Preparation ==\nMellitic acid may be prepared by warming mellite with ammonium carbonate, boiling off the excess of the ammonium salt, and adding ammonia to the solution. The precipitated alumina is filtered off, the filtrate evaporated, and the ammonium salt of the acid purified by recrystallization. The ammonium salt is then converted into the lead salt by precipitation with lead acetate, and the lead salt is then decomposed by hydrogen sulfide. The acid may also be prepared by the oxidation of pure carbon, graphite or hexamethylbenzene, by alkaline potassium permanganate in the cold, or by hot concentrated nitric acid.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nIt is a very stable compound; chlorine, concentrated nitric acid and hydriodic acid do not react with it. It is decomposed, on dry distillation, into carbon dioxide and pyromellitic acid, C10H6O8; when distilled with lime it gives carbon dioxide and benzene. Long digestion of the acid with an excess of phosphorus pentachloride forms the acid chloride, which crystallizes in needles, and melts at 190 \u00b0C. By heating the ammonium salt of the acid to 150\u2013160 \u00b0C while ammonia is evolved, a mixture of paramide (mellimide, molecular formula C6(CONHCO)3), and ammonium euchroate is obtained. The mixture may be separated by dissolving out the ammonium euchroate with water. Paramide is a white amorphous powder, insoluble in water and alcohol.\nThe high stability of mellitic acid salts and their presence as an endproduct of the oxidation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are present in the solar system, make them a possible organic substance in Martian soil.\nMellitates (and salts of other benzene polycarboxylic acids) of iron and cobalt have interesting magnetic properties.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMellitic anhydride\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHenry Enfield Roscoe, Carl Scholemmer, \"Mellitene Group\", \"A Treatise on Chemistry: V.III: The Chemistry of the Hydrocarbons and their Derivatives on Organic Chemistry: P.V:529.

It is commonly encountered as the dodecahydrate, KAl(SO4)2\u00b712H2O. It crystallizes in an octahedral structure in neutral solution and cubic structure in an alkali solution with space group Pa3 and lattice parameter of 12.18 \u00c5. The compound is the most important member of the generic class of compounds called alums, and is often called simply alum.\nPotassium alum is commonly used in water purification, leather tanning, dyeing, fireproof textiles, and baking powder as E number E522. It also has cosmetic uses as a deodorant, as an aftershave treatment and as a styptic for minor bleeding from shaving.\n\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, potassium alum was used extensively in the wool industry from Classical antiquity, during the Middle Ages, and well into 19th century as a mordant or dye fixative in the process of turning wool into dyed bolts of cloth.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\n\n==== Egypt ====\nPotassium alum was also known to the Ancient Egyptians, who obtained it from evaporites in the Western desert and reportedly used it as early as 1500 BCE to reduce the visible cloudiness (turbidity) in the water.\n\n\n==== Mesopotamia ====\nAccording to the expert on Middle Eastern history of chemistry Martin Levey, potassium alum is one of the few compounds known to the ancients that can be found relatively pure in nature, as well as one of only a few chemicals used in Mesopotamian chemical technology that can be identified with certainty. Both native and imported potassium alum was used. Together with other agents, potassium alum was used in glass-making, tanning, and in the dyeing of cloth, wood, and possibly hair. A tanning process using potassium alum is described in tablets from the first millennium BCE. When Levey wrote his article in 1958, no description of the dyeing process had been found, so it is not known how potassium alum was used in it. In Mesopotamian medicine potassium alum was used extensively, for example against itch, jaundice, some eye condition, and unidentified ailments. \nAccording to Levey, potassium alum was used in \"classical times\" as a flux when soldering copper, in the fireproofing of wood, and in the separation of silver and gold, but that there is no evidence that these uses existed in Mesopotamia.\n\n\n==== Greece ====\nThe production of potassium alum from alunite is archaeologically attested on the island Lesbos. This site was abandoned in the 7th century but dates back at least to the 2nd century CE.\n\n\n==== Rome ====\nPotassium alum was described under the name alumen or salsugoterrae by Pliny, and it is clearly the same as the stypteria (\u03c3\u03c4\u03c5\u03c0\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b1) described by Dioscorides.  However, the name alum and other names applied to this substance \u2014 like misy, sory, chalcanthum, and atramentum sutorium \u2014 were often applied to other products with vaguely similar properties or uses, such as iron sulfate or \"green vitriol\".\n\n\n==== India and China ====\nPotassium alum is mentioned in  Ayurvedic texts namely Charak Samhita, Sushurta Samhita, and Ashtanga Hridaya with the name such as spha\u1e6dika k\u1e63\u0101ra,  phitkari or saurashtri. It is used in traditional Chinese medicine with the name mingfan .\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nIn the 13th and 14th centuries, alum (from alunite) was a major import from Phocaea (Gulf of Smyrna in Byzantium) by Genoans and Venetians (and was a cause of war between Genoa and Venice) and later by Florence. After the fall of Constantinople, alunite (the source of alum) was discovered at Tolfa in the Papal States (1461). The textile dyeing industry in Bruges, and many locations in Italy, and later in England, required alum to stabilize the dyes onto the fabric (make the dyes \"fast\") and also to brighten the co\nA metal (from Ancient Greek  \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd (m\u00e9tallon) 'mine, quarry, metal') is a material that, when polished or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. These properties are all associated with having electrons available at the Fermi level, as against nonmetallic materials which do not.:\u200aChpt 8 & 19\u200a:\u200aChpt 7 & 8\u200a Metals are typically ductile (can be drawn into wires) and malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets).\nA metal may be a chemical element such as iron; an alloy such as stainless steel; or a molecular compound such as polymeric sulfur nitride. The general science of metals is called metallurgy, a subtopic of materials science; aspects of the electronic and thermal properties are also within the scope of condensed matter physics and solid-state chemistry, it is a multidisciplinary topic. In colloquial use materials such as steel alloys are referred to as metals, while others such as polymers, wood or ceramics are nonmetallic materials.\nA metal conducts electricity at a temperature of absolute zero, which is a consequence of delocalized states at the Fermi energy. Many elements and compounds become metallic under high pressures, for example, iodine gradually becomes a metal at a pressure of between 40 and 170 thousand times atmospheric pressure. Sodium becomes a nonmetal at pressure of just under two million times atmospheric pressure, and at even higher pressures it is expected to become a metal again.\nWhen discussing the periodic table and some chemical properties the term metal is often used to denote those elements which in pure form and at standard conditions are metals in the sense of electrical conduction mentioned above.  The related term metallic may also be used for types of dopant atoms or alloying elements.\nIn astronomy metal refers to all chemical elements in a star that are heavier than helium. In this sense the first four \"metals\" collecting in stellar cores through nucleosynthesis are carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon. A star fuses lighter atoms, mostly hydrogen and helium, into heavier atoms over its lifetime. The metallicity of an astronomical object is the proportion of its matter made up of the heavier chemical elements.\nThe strength and resilience of some metals has led to their frequent use in, for example, high-rise building and bridge construction, as well as most vehicles, many home appliances, tools, pipes, and railroad tracks. Precious metals were historically used as coinage, but in the modern era, coinage metals have extended to at least 23 of the chemical elements. There is also extensive use of multi-element metals such as titanium nitride or degenerate semiconductors in the semiconductor industry.\nThe history of refined metals is thought to begin with the use of copper about 11,000 years ago. Gold, silver, iron (as meteoric iron), lead, and brass were likewise in use before the first known appearance of bronze in the fifth millennium BCE. Subsequent developments include the production of early forms of steel; the discovery of sodium\u2014the first light metal\u2014in 1809; the rise of modern alloy steels; and, since the end of World War II, the development of more sophisticated alloys.\n\n\n== Properties ==\n\n\n=== Form and structure ===\n\nMost metals are shiny and lustrous, at least when polished, or fractured. Sheets of metal thicker than a few micrometres appear opaque, but gold leaf transmits green light. This is due to the freely moving electrons which reflect light.\nAlthough most elemental metals have higher densities than nonmetals, there is a wide variation in their densities, lithium being the least dense (0.534 g/cm3) and osmium (22.59 g/cm3) the most dense. Some of the 6d transition metals are expected to be denser than osmium, but their known isotopes are too unstable for bulk production to be possible Magnesium, aluminium and titanium are light metals of significant commercial importance. Their respective densities of 1.7, 2.7, and 4.5 g/\nNatrolite is a tectosilicate mineral species belonging to the zeolite group. It is a hydrated sodium and aluminium silicate with the formula Na2Al2Si3O10\u00b72H2O.  The type locality is Hohentwiel, Hegau, Germany.\nIt was named natrolite by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in 1803. The name is derived from natron (\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd), the Greek word for soda, in reference to the sodium content, and lithos (\u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2), meaning stone.  Needle stone or needle-zeolite are other informal names, alluding to the common acicular habit of the crystals, which are often very slender and are aggregated in divergent tufts.  The crystals are frequently epitaxial overgrowths of natrolite, mesolite, and gonnardite in various orders.\n\n\n== Properties ==\nLarger crystals most commonly have the form of a square prism terminated by a low pyramid, the prism angle being nearly a right angle. The crystals are tetragonal in appearance, though actually orthorhombic. There are perfect cleavages parallel to the faces of the prism. The mineral also often occurs in compact fibrous aggregates, the fibers having a divergent or radial arrangement. Natrolite is readily distinguished from other fibrous zeolites by its optical characteristics.\nBetween crossed nicols the fibers extinguish parallel to their length, and they do not show an optic figure in convergent polarized light. Natrolite is usually white or colorless, but sometimes reddish or yellowish. The luster is vitreous, or, in finely fibrous specimens, silky.\nThe specific gravity is 2.2, and the hardness is 5.5. The mineral is readily fusible, melting in a candle-flame to which it imparts a yellow color owing to the presence of sodium. It is decomposed by hydrochloric acid with separation of gelatinous silica.\n\n\n== Environment ==\nNatrolite occurs with other zeolites in the amygdaloidal cavities of basaltic igneous rocks.  It is also common in nepheline syenites.\n\n\n== Notable localities ==\nExcellent specimens of diverging groups of white prismatic crystals are found in compact basalt at the Puy-deMarman, Puy-de-D\u00f4me, France. Huge crystals have been found on the Kola Peninsula, Russia (30 cm by 13 cm). The walls of cavities in the basalt of the Giants Causeway, in County Antrim, are frequently encrusted with slender needles of natrolite, and similar material is found abundantly in the volcanic rocks (basalt and phonolite) of Salesel, Aussig and several other places in the north of Bohemia.  Mont St. Hilaire, Quebec has produced large crystals associated with many rare minerals. The Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia, New Jersey, Oregon, and British Columbia have also produced excellent specimens.\nSeveral varieties of natrolite have been distinguished: fargite is a red natrolite from Glenfarg in Perthshire; bergmannite or spreustein is an impure variety which has resulted by the alteration of other minerals, chiefly sodalite, in the augite syenite of southern Norway.\nNatrolite is one of the closely associated minerals with benitoite, a rare mineral with its type locality in San Benito County, California.\nNatrolite forms opaque white spherical inclusions within nodules of translucent green prehnite from Wave Hill, Northern Territory, Australia.\n\n\n== Images ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nPressure-induced hydration\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nStructure type NAT\nMineral Galleries\nMindat\nWebmineral\n\n\n=== Attribution ===\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

He is remembered for creation of a fusible alloy known as Rose metal, which is composed of lead, bismuth and tin.\nBeginning in 1761, he was owner and manager of a laboratory and pharmacy in Berlin known as Zum Wei\u00dfen Schwan (At the White Swan). After his death in 1771, famed chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth (1743\u20131817) became manager of the establishment.\nHis son, also named Valentin Rose, was a noted pharmacist. Mineralogists Heinrich Rose and Gustav Rose were his grandsons; the classicist Valentin Rose and the surgeon Edmund Rose were his great-grandsons.\n\n\n== References ==\nRose, Heinrich at Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie.\nGroup 4 is the second group of transition metals in the periodic table. It contains the four elements titanium (Ti), zirconium (Zr), hafnium (Hf), and rutherfordium (Rf). The group is also called the titanium group or titanium family after its lightest member.\nAs is typical for early transition metals, zirconium and hafnium have only the group oxidation state of +4 as a major one, and are quite electropositive and have a less rich coordination chemistry. Due to the effects of the lanthanide contraction, they are very similar in properties. Titanium is somewhat distinct due to its smaller size: it has a well-defined +3 state as well (although +4 is more stable).\nAll the group 4 elements are hard, refractory metals. Their inherent reactivity is completely masked due to the formation of a dense oxide layer that protects them from corrosion, as well as attack by many acids and alkalis. The first three of them occur naturally. Rutherfordium is strongly radioactive: it does not occur naturally and must be produced by artificial synthesis, but its observed and theoretically predicted properties are consistent with it being a heavier homologue of hafnium. None of them have any biological role.\n\n\n== History ==\nZircon was known as a gemstone from ancient times, but it was not known to contain a new element until the work of German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth in 1789. He analysed the zircon-containing mineral jargoon and found a new earth (oxide), but was unable to isolate the element from its oxide. Cornish chemist Humphry Davy also attempted to isolate this new element in 1808 through electrolysis, but failed: he gave it the name zirconium. In 1824, Swedish chemist J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius isolated an impure form of zirconium, obtained by heating a mixture of potassium and potassium zirconium fluoride in an iron tube.\nCornish mineralogist William Gregor first identified titanium in ilmenite sand beside a stream in Cornwall, Great Britain in the year 1791. After analyzing the sand, he determined the weakly magnetic sand to contain iron oxide and a metal oxide that he could not identify. During that same year, mineralogist Franz Joseph Muller produced the same metal oxide and could not identify it. In 1795, chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth independently rediscovered the metal oxide in rutile from the Hungarian village Boinik. He identified the oxide containing a new element and named it for the Titans of Greek mythology. Berzelius was also the first to prepare titanium metal (albeit impurely), doing so in 1825.\nThe X-ray spectroscopy done by Henry Moseley in 1914 showed a direct dependency between spectral line and effective nuclear charge. This led to the nuclear charge, or atomic number of an element, being used to ascertain its place within the periodic table. With this method, Moseley determined the number of lanthanides and showed that there was a missing element with atomic number 72. This spurred chemists to look for it. Georges Urbain asserted that he found element 72 in the rare earth elements in 1907 and published his results on celtium in 1911. Neither the spectra nor the chemical behavior he claimed matched with the element found later, and therefore his claim was turned down after a long-standing controversy.\nBy early 1923, several physicists and chemists such as Niels Bohr and Charles Rugeley Bury suggested that element 72 should resemble zirconium and therefore was not part of the rare earth elements group. These suggestions were based on Bohr's theories of the atom, the X-ray spectroscopy of Moseley, and the chemical arguments of Friedrich Paneth. Encouraged by this, and by the reappearance in 1922 of Urbain's claims that element 72 was a rare earth element discovered in 1911, Dirk Coster and Georg von Hevesy were motivated to search for the new element in zirconium ores. Hafnium was discovered by the two in 1923 in Copenhagen, Denmark. The place where the discovery took place led to the element being named for the Latin\nRalf Volker Sander (born 15 December 1963) is an international active sculptor. His best\nknown works include Lady Bird Transformation(mirage), a public sculpture for Busan Cinema Center, South Korea, commissioned in 2011 and erected in August 2012. The memorial for Martin Heinrich Klaproth\nwas erected on the campus of Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, 25 June 1996.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nBorn in West Berlin, Sander grew up in the British sector. He studied fine art and the history of art\nat Berlin University of the Arts, from 1986 to 1988. After the death of his Stepfather, Klaus Komoll,\nwho left him a small sailing vessel, he was able to circumnavigate the world between 1988 and 1990 in order to\nstudy the tribal art of the pacific islands and Papua New Guinea. He completed his studies with\na postgraduate course in sculpture at the Berlin University of the Arts, between 1991 and 1994. He\ntravelled to China and Japan with a DAAD grant to study Asian Art and philosophy between 1992 and 1994.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nAlmost all of his early works took the human body as its subject and base for human scale wooden sculptures and carvings made from a single log of wood. Sander describes his work as: \"encounter with the other side of appearance\".  His work attempts to treat the body not as an object but a common condition. Since 2000 he experiments with different materials and media, including film. He repeatedly refers in his work on whole social groups and integrates their participation into the working process, (as in:Rolandtransfer, Child's play, Lernen ist sich Oeffnen) relying on Joseph Beuys term Soziale Plastik. In 2003 and 2004, Ralf Sander became visiting professor at Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, Poland.\nThe annual exhibition Aquamediale was curated and initiated together with Sieghard Auer in 2005.\nIn the same year, he was also appointed Reader at University of Ulster in Belfast, Northern Ireland. From 2008 to 2012, Ralf Sander worked as professor for sculpture at Seoul National University, South Korea.\nIn 2008, he started the World Saving Machine cycle, a visionary project and inquiry of the impact of science on wider cultural contexts. World Saving Machine I and III are part of the WSM-Project. Both focus on transformation of solar energy into ice\u2013 literally, as well as (on a larger scale) metaphorically. World Saving Machine 2 transforms carbon dioxide into oxygen.\nThe project was continued in collaboration with KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) University, Daedeok, Korea. In 2010, he became member of the commission board for Expo 2012 in Yeosu, South Korea.\nOne year later, Sander won the international art commission for the Busan Cinema Center. The iconic building is designed by Wolf Prix- Coop Himmelb(l)au, as host of the Busan International Film Festival, Asia's largest film festival.

He then succeeded in producing pure uranium metal by reducing uranium tetrachloride (UCl4) with potassium metal.  Today better methods have been found.\n\nP\u00e9ligot was a professor of analytical chemistry at the Institut National Agronomique. He collaborated with Jean-Baptiste Dumas, and together they discovered the methyl radical during experiments on wood spirit (methanol). The terminology \"methyl alcohol\" was created by both chemists from \"wood wine\". They also prepared the gaseous dimethyl ether, and many esters. In 1838, they successfully transformed camphor into p-cymene using phosphorus pentoxide.\nIn 1844 he synthesized chromium(II) acetate, which was much later recognized (by F. Albert Cotton in 1964) to be the first chemical compound which contains a quadruple bond.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of chemists\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhotograph of Peligot\nWilliam Gregor (25 December 1761 \u2013 11 June 1817) was a British clergyman and mineralogist who discovered the elemental metal Titanium.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nHe was born at the Trewarthenick Estate in Cornwall, the son of Francis Gregor and Mary Copley and the brother of Francis Gregor, MP for Cornwall. He was educated at Bristol Grammar School, where he became interested in chemistry, then after two years with a private tutor entered St John's College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1784 and MA in 1787. He was ordained in the Church of England. He became vicar of St Mary's Church Diptford near Totnes, Devon. He married Charlotte Anne Gwatkin in 1790 and they had one daughter, Charlotte-Anne Gregor.\n\n\n== Discovery of titanium ==\nAfter a brief interval at Bratton Clovelly, in 1793 William and his family moved permanently to the rectory of Creed in Cornwall. Here he continued his remarkably accurate chemical analysis of minerals, most of which came from Cornwall, such as the zeolites found in gabbro on The Lizard. He also analysed wavellite, tourmaline, and the uranium minerals torbernite and autunite, the arsenate scorodite, the lead mineral mimetite and the nickel mineral niccolite, and others. But he is best known for one of his earliest discoveries: in 1791, while analysing the minerals in a black sand he had discovered in the Manaccan valley, he isolated the calx of an unknown metal which he named manaccanite. Later in 1791, Martin Heinrich Klaproth discovered what is now known as the transition metal, titanium in the mineral rutile. Believing this to be a new discovery, Klaproth named it titanium after the Titans of Greek Mythology, but eventually it was clarified that Gregor made the discovery first. Gregor was credited with the discovery, but the element kept the name chosen by Klaproth. Gregor later found titanium in corundum from Tibet, and in a tourmaline from a local tin mine.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nGregor was made an honorary member of the Geological Society of London on its inception in 1807, and was a founding member of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall in 1814. His friends and correspondents included John Hawkins, Philip Rashleigh and John Ayrton Paris. Never letting his scientific work interfere with his pastoral duties, he was also a distinguished landscape painter, etcher and musician. He died of tuberculosis on 11 June 1817 and was buried at nearby Cornelly church.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n Works by or about William Gregor at Wikisource\nBeryllium is a chemical element; it has symbol Be and atomic number 4. It is a steel-gray, hard, strong, lightweight and brittle alkaline earth metal. It is a divalent element that occurs naturally only in combination with other elements to form minerals. Gemstones high in beryllium include beryl (aquamarine, emerald, red beryl) and chrysoberyl. It is a relatively rare element in the universe, usually occurring as a product of the spallation of larger atomic nuclei that have collided with cosmic rays. Within the cores of stars, beryllium is depleted as it is fused into heavier elements. Beryllium constitutes about 0.0004 percent by mass of Earth's crust. The world's annual beryllium production of 220 tons is usually manufactured by extraction from the mineral beryl, a difficult process because beryllium bonds strongly to oxygen.\nIn structural applications, the combination of high flexural rigidity, thermal stability, thermal conductivity and low density (1.85 times that of water) make beryllium a desirable aerospace material for aircraft components, missiles, spacecraft, and satellites. Because of its low density and atomic mass, beryllium is relatively transparent to X-rays and other forms of ionizing radiation; therefore, it is the most common window material for X-ray equipment and components of particle detectors. When added as an alloying element to aluminium, copper (notably the alloy beryllium copper), iron, or nickel, beryllium improves many physical properties. For example, tools and components made of beryllium copper alloys are strong and hard and do not create sparks when they strike a steel surface. In air, the surface of beryllium oxidizes readily at room temperature to form a passivation layer 1\u201310 nm thick that protects it from further oxidation and corrosion. The metal oxidizes in bulk (beyond the passivation layer) when heated above 500 \u00b0C (932 \u00b0F), and burns brilliantly when heated to about 2,500 \u00b0C (4,530 \u00b0F).\nThe commercial use of beryllium requires the use of appropriate dust control equipment and industrial controls at all times because of the toxicity of inhaled beryllium-containing dusts that can cause a chronic life-threatening allergic disease, berylliosis, in some people. Berylliosis is typically manifested by chronic pulmonary fibrosis and, in severe cases, right sided heart failure and death.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Physical properties ===\nBeryllium is a steel gray and hard metal that is brittle at room temperature and has a close-packed hexagonal crystal structure. It has exceptional stiffness (Young's modulus 287 GPa) and a melting point of 1287 \u00b0C. The modulus of elasticity of beryllium is approximately 35% greater than that of steel. The combination of this modulus and a relatively low density results in an unusually fast sound conduction speed in beryllium \u2013 about 12.9 km/s at ambient conditions. Other significant properties are high specific heat (1925 J\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7K\u22121) and thermal conductivity (216 W\u00b7m\u22121\u00b7K\u22121), which make beryllium the metal with the best heat dissipation characteristics per unit weight. In combination with the relatively low coefficient of linear thermal expansion (11.4 \u00d7 10\u22126 K\u22121), these characteristics result in a unique stability under conditions of thermal loading.\n\n\n=== Nuclear properties ===\nNaturally occurring beryllium, save for slight contamination by the cosmogenic radioisotopes, is isotopically pure beryllium-9, which has a nuclear spin of \u20603/2\u2060. Beryllium has a large scattering cross section for high-energy neutrons, about 6 barns for energies above approximately 10 keV. Therefore, it works as a neutron reflector and neutron moderator, effectively slowing the neutrons to the thermal energy range of below 0.03 eV, where the total cross section is at least an order of magnitude lower; the exact value strongly depends on the purity and size of the crystallites in the material.\nThe single primordial beryllium isotope 9Be also undergoes a (n,2n) neutron reaction with\nArthur Schopenhauer ( SHOH-p\u0259n-how-\u0259r; German: [\u02c8a\u0281tu\u02d0\u0250\u032f \u02c8\u0283o\u02d0pn\u0329ha\u028a\u0250] ; 22 February 1788 \u2013 21 September 1860) was a German philosopher. He is known for his 1818 work The World as Will and Representation (expanded in 1844), which characterizes the phenomenal world as the manifestation of a blind and irrational noumenal will. Building on the transcendental idealism of Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804), Schopenhauer developed an atheistic metaphysical and ethical system that rejected the contemporaneous ideas of German idealism.\nSchopenhauer was among the first thinkers in Western philosophy to share and affirm significant tenets of Indian philosophy, such as asceticism, denial of the self, and the notion of the world-as-appearance. His work has been described as an exemplary manifestation of philosophical pessimism. Though his work failed to garner substantial attention during his lifetime, he had a posthumous impact across various disciplines, including philosophy, literature, and science. His writing on aesthetics, morality, and psychology have influenced many thinkers and artists.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\n\n=== Family ===\nArthur Schopenhauer's paternal grandfather, Andreas Schopenhauer (1720\u20131793), was a wealthy merchant in Danzig. Arthur Schopenhauer's paternal grandmother, Anna Renata Schopenhauer (1726\u20131804), was the daughter of a Dutch merchant and the Dutch ambassador to the Hanseatic city of Danzig Hendrik Soermans (1700\u20131775). Arthur Schopenhauer's maternal grandfather, Christian Heinrich Trosiener (1730\u20131797) was a merchant in Danzig and a councilor from the middle class. Arthur Schopenhauer's maternal grandmother, Elizabeth Trosiener (1745\u20131818), was daughter of pharmacist Georg Lehmann (died 1762) and his wife Susanna Concordia Lehmann, n\u00e9e Neumann (born 1718). Arthur Schopenhauer's paternal great-grandfather, Johann Schopenhauer (1670\u2013after 1724), was the mentioned merchant in Gdansk. Arthur Schopenhauer's paternal great-grandfather through paternal grandmother, Hendrik Soermans (1700\u20131775), was a Dutch merchant, Ambassador of the Netherlands in Gdansk, son of pastor Johannes Soermans (1670\u20131754) and grandson of Martinus Soermans (1638\u20131705). Arthur Schopenhauer's paternal great-greatgrandfather, Johann Schopenhauer (1630\u20131701), was farmer in Petershagen and son of Simon Schopenhauer (1580\u20131660) and grandson of Salomon Schopenhauer (born 1550). Arthur Schopenhauer's paternal great-grandmother, Marie Elizabeth Schopenhauer, n\u00e9e Lessig, was a daughter of merchant Andreas Lessig (1658\u20131713).\n\n\n=== Early life ===\n\nArthur Schopenhauer was born on 22 February 1788, in Gda\u0144sk (then part of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth; later in the Kingdom of Prussia Danzig) on \u015aw. Ducha 47 (in Prussia Heiliggeistgasse), the son of Heinrich Floris Schopenhauer (1747\u20131805) and his wife Johanna Schopenhauer (n\u00e9e Trosiener; 1766\u20131838), both descendants of wealthy German patrician families. While they came from a Protestant background, neither of them was very religious;:\u200a79\u200a both supported the French Revolution,:\u200a13\u200a were republicans, cosmopolitans and Anglophiles.:\u200a9\u200a When Gda\u0144sk became part of Prussia in 1793, Heinrich moved to Hamburg\u2014a free city with a republican constitution. His firm continued trading in Danzig where most of their extended families remained. Adele, Arthur's only sibling, was born on 12 July 1797.\nIn 1797, Arthur was sent to Le Havre to live with the family of his father's business associate, Gr\u00e9goire de Bl\u00e9simaire. He seemed to enjoy his two-year stay there, learning to speak French and fostering a life-long friendship with Jean Anthime Gr\u00e9goire de Bl\u00e9simaire.:\u200a18\u200a As early as 1799, Arthur started playing the flute.:\u200a30\u200a\nIn 1803, he accompanied his parents on a European tour of Holland, Britain, France, Switzerland, Austria and Prussia. Viewed as primarily a pleasure tour, Heinrich used the opportunity to visit some of his business associates abroad.\nHeinrich presented Arthur with a choice: he could either stay at home to begin prep\nSamuel Heinrich Schwabe (25 October 1789 \u2013 11 April 1875) was a German amateur astronomer remembered for his work on sunspots. He observed sunspots and made drawings of them from 1825 to 1867 and suggested in 1838 that there may be a ten-year cycle of sunspot activity. He also took an interest in botany and was a founding member of a natural history society in Dessau.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\nSchwabe was born in Dessau, Germany, where his father was a physician to the duke. His mother was the daughter of apothecary Johann H. G. H\u00e4seler (1740-1812) and he too trained to be one in 1806 by joining the Dessau Mohrenapotheke owned by H\u00e4seler. After about three years he began to study at the University of Berlin training in pharmacy under Martin Heinrich Klaproth and Sigismund Friedrich Hermbst\u00e4dt. He also took an interest in astronomy and botany and was forced to stop studies when his grandfather H\u00e4seler fell ill. After the death of H\u00e4seler in 1812, Schwabe was forced to take over the family pharmacy business and the family became prosperous. He spent his spare time in scientific pursuits but it was only after selling off the business that he began to attend to scientific activities fulltime.\n\nSchwabe obtained his first telescope through a lottery in 1825 and began his observations on sunspots from 30 October 1825. In 1826 he obtained a better telescope, a 4.8-in. Fraunhofer refractor that was used by Wilhelm Lohrmann to map the Moon. From 1829 he was completely involved in scientific work. Schwabe was looking for a theoretical planet inside the orbit of Mercury, known as Vulcan. Because of the proximity to the Sun, it would have been very difficult to observe such a planet, and Schwabe believed one possibility to detect a new planet might be to see it during its transit in front of the Sun. For 17 years, from 1826 to 1843, on every clear day, Schwabe would scan the Sun and record its spots trying to detect any new planet among them. He kept notes but was not interested in publishing his results. His first note was a letter to Heinrich Schumacher which was published in Astronomical Nachrichten (no. 495). Although he did not find any planet transiting the solar disc he noticed the regular variation in the number of sunspots and published his findings in a short article entitled \"Solar Observations during 1843\". In it he made the suggestion of a probable ten-year period (i.e. that at every tenth year the number of spots reached a maximum). This paper at first attracted little attention, but Rudolf Wolf who was at that time the director of Bern observatory, was impressed so he began regular observations of sunspots. Schwabe's observations were afterwards utilized in 1850 by Alexander von Humboldt in the third volume of his Kosmos. The periodicity of sunspots is now fully recognized; and to Schwabe is thus due the credit of one of the most important discoveries in astronomy. Data from his notes and 8486 drawings has been digitized and analyzed. They have helped fill in gaps in the data collected by Rudolf Wolf from 1848. Schwabe also made observations of the Great Red Spot of Jupiter and made notes of it in 1831 although these were only noticed and published in 1899.\nSchwabe was involved in founding a natural history society in Dessau where he served as its president. He contributed many mineral specimens to the collections of the society. In 1838 and 1839 he published his notes on botany in two volumes under the title Flora Anhaltina, describing nearly 2000 plant species.\nIn 1857 Schwabe was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society. The medal was presented by Richard Carrington in Dessau and the honor influenced Schwabe to bequeath his notes to the Royal Astronomical Society which elected him as a member in 1868.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911). \"Schwabe, Samuel Heinrich\". Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Vol. 24 (11th ed.). Cambridge Unive\nThe actinide () or actinoid () series encompasses at least the 14 metallic chemical elements in the 5f series, with atomic numbers from 89 to 102, actinium through nobelium. (Number 103, lawrencium, is sometimes also included despite being part of the 6d transition series.) The actinide series derives its name from the first element in the series, actinium. The informal chemical symbol An is used in general discussions of actinide chemistry to refer to any actinide.\nThe 1985 IUPAC Red Book recommends that actinoid be used rather than actinide, since the suffix -ide normally indicates a negative ion. However, owing to widespread current use, actinide is still allowed. Since actinoid literally means actinium-like (cf. humanoid or android), it has been argued for semantic reasons that actinium cannot logically be an actinoid, but IUPAC acknowledges its inclusion based on common usage.\nActinium through nobelium are f-block elements, while lawrencium is a d-block element and a transition metal. The series mostly corresponds to the filling of the 5f electron shell, although as isolated atoms in the ground state many have anomalous configurations involving the filling of the 6d shell due to interelectronic repulsion. In comparison with the lanthanides, also mostly f-block elements, the actinides show much more variable valence. They all have very large atomic and ionic radii and exhibit an unusually large range of physical properties. While actinium and the late actinides (from curium onwards) behave similarly to the lanthanides, the elements thorium, protactinium, and uranium are much more similar to transition metals in their chemistry, with neptunium, plutonium, and americium occupying an intermediate position.\nAll actinides are radioactive and release energy upon radioactive decay; naturally occurring uranium and thorium, and synthetically produced plutonium are the most abundant actinides on Earth. These have been used in nuclear reactors, and uranium and plutonium are critical elements of nuclear weapons. Uranium and thorium also have diverse current or historical uses, and americium is used in the ionization chambers of most modern smoke detectors.\nOf the actinides, primordial thorium and uranium occur naturally in substantial quantities. The radioactive decay of uranium produces transient amounts of actinium and protactinium, and atoms of neptunium and plutonium are occasionally produced from transmutation reactions in uranium ores. The other actinides are purely synthetic elements. Nuclear weapons tests have released at least six actinides heavier than plutonium into the environment; analysis of debris from a 1952 hydrogen bomb explosion showed the presence of americium, curium, berkelium, californium, einsteinium and fermium.\nIn presentations of the periodic table, the f-block elements are customarily shown as two additional rows below the main body of the table. This convention is entirely a matter of aesthetics and formatting practicality; a rarely used wide-formatted periodic table inserts the 4f and 5f series in their proper places, as parts of the table's sixth and seventh rows (periods).\n\n\n== Discovery, isolation and synthesis ==\n\nLike the lanthanides, the actinides form a family of elements with similar properties. Within the actinides, there are two overlapping groups: transuranium elements, which follow uranium in the periodic table; and transplutonium elements, which follow plutonium. Compared to the lanthanides, which (except for promethium) are found in nature in appreciable quantities, most actinides are rare. Most do not occur in nature, and of those that do, only thorium and uranium do so in more than trace quantities. The most abundant or easily synthesized actinides are uranium and thorium, followed by plutonium, americium, actinium, protactinium, neptunium, and curium.\nThe existence of transuranium elements was suggested in 1934 by Enrico Fermi, based on his experiments. However, even though four actinides\nAndreas Sigismund Marggraf (German: [\u02c8ma\u0280k\u0261\u0280a\u02d0f]; 3 March 1709 \u2013 7 August 1782) was a German chemist from Berlin, then capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and a pioneer of analytical chemistry. He isolated zinc in 1746 by heating calamine and carbon. Though he was not the first to do so, Marggraf is credited with carefully describing the process and establishing its basic theory. In 1747, Marggraf announced his discovery of sugar in beets and devised a method using alcohol to extract it.  His student Franz Achard later devised an economical industrial method to extract the sugar in its pure form. \n\n\n== Life ==\nAndreas Sigismund Marggraf was the son of the pharmacist Henning Christian Marggraf (1680\u20131754), who owned a pharmacy in Berlin and lectured at the Collegium Medico-Chirurgicum (medical/surgical school). Marggraf came in contact with the pharmaceutical and medical business early and started studying at the medical school in 1725. He studied with Caspar Neumann in Berlin, visited pharmacies in other cities, including Frankfurt am Main and Strasbourg and attended lectures at the University of Halle. He worked in his father's pharmacy and focused his work on chemistry. In later life he helped to reorganize the Societ\u00e4t der Wissenschaften into the Akademie der Wissenschaften (Prussian Academy of Science) and became the director of the physics section in 1760. In 1774 he had a stroke, and continued working at the laboratories of the Akademie until his retirement in 1781.\n\n\n== Scientific work ==\nMarggraf introduced several new methods into experimental chemistry. He used precipitation methods for analysis, such as the Prussian blue reaction for the detection of iron.  Marggraf's major work in inorganic chemistry included the improved production of phosphorus from urine and the detection of alkali metal salts in plant ash and their identification by flame test. Before his 1762 work, (al)chemists didn't systematically distinguish between potassium and sodium salts.\nHis extraction of sugar from beets, which was then only available from sugarcane, was the starting point for the sugar industry in Europe, and the modern sugar industry in the world. Although Marggraf recognized the economic impact of his discovery, he did not pursue it. Marggraf's student Franz Achard, completed the work and developed an economic extraction method for sugar from sugar beet. Other students of Marggraf included Johann Gottlob Lehmann, Franz Carl Achard and probably Valentin Rose the Elder and Martin Heinrich Klaproth. He was the first to isolate glucose from raisins in 1747.\n\n\n=== Isolation of zinc ===\n\nMarggraf had isolated zinc in 1746 by heating a mixture of calamine and carbon in a closed vessel without copper. He was unaware that the same process had been developed (and patented) by William Champion in England around 1738\u20131740 and by Anton von Swab in Sweden around 1742. However, Marggraf described the process in great detail and established its basic theory, for which he is often credited with isolation of zinc. This procedure became commercially practical by 1752.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nChisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911). \"Marggraf, Andreas Sigismund\" . Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Vol. 17 (11th ed.).
