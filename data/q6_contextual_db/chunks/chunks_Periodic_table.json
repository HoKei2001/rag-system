        "content": "The periodic table, also known as the periodic table of the elements, is an ordered arrangement of the chemical elements into rows (\"periods\") and columns (\"groups\"). It is an icon of chemistry and is widely used in physics and other sciences. It is a depiction of the periodic law, which states that when the elements are arranged in order of their atomic numbers an approximate recurrence of their properties is evident. The table is divided into four roughly rectangular areas called blocks. Elements in the same group tend to show similar chemical characteristics.\nVertical, horizontal and diagonal trends characterize the periodic table. Metallic character increases going down a group and from right to left across a period. Nonmetallic character increases going from the bottom left of the periodic table to the top right.\nThe first periodic table to become generally accepted was that of the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869; he formulated the periodic law as a dependence of chemical properties on atomic mass. As not all elements were then known, there were gaps in his periodic table, and Mendeleev successfully used the periodic law to predict some properties of some of the missing elements. The periodic law was recognized as a fundamental discovery in the late 19th century. It was explained early in the 20th century, with the discovery of atomic numbers and associated pioneering work in quantum mechanics, both ideas serving to illuminate the internal structure of the atom. A recognisably modern form of the table was reached in 1945 with Glenn T. Seaborg's discovery that the actinides were in fact f-block rather than d-block elements. The periodic table and law are now a central and indispensable part of modern chemistry.\nThe periodic table continues to evolve with the progress of science. In nature, only elements up to atomic number 94  exist; to go further, it was necessary to synthesize new elements in the laboratory. By 2010, the first 118 elements were known, thereby completing the first seven rows of the table; however, chemical characterization is still needed for the heaviest elements to confirm that their properties match their positions. New discoveries will extend the table beyond these seven rows, though it is not yet known how many more elements are possible; moreover, theoretical calculations suggest that this unknown region will not follow the patterns of the known part of the table. Some scientific discussion also continues regarding whether some elements are correctly positioned in today's table. Many alternative representations of the periodic law exist, and there is some discussion as to whether there is an optimal form of the periodic table.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nEach chemical element has a unique atomic number (Z— for \"Zahl\", German for \"number\") representing the number of protons in its nucleus. Each distinct atomic number therefore corresponds to a class of atom: these classes are called the chemical elements. The chemical elements are what the periodic table classifies and organizes. Hydrogen is the element with atomic number 1; helium, atomic number 2; lithium, atomic number 3; and so on. Each of these names can be further abbreviated by a one- or two-letter chemical symbol; those for hydrogen, helium, and lithium are respectively H, He, and Li. Neutrons do not affect the atom's chemical identity, but do affect its weight. Atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes of the same chemical element. Naturally occurring elements usually occur as mixes of different isotopes; since each isotope usually occurs with a characteristic abundance, naturally occurring elements have well-defined atomic weights, defined as the average mass of a naturally occurring atom of that element.\nAll elements have multiple isotopes, variants with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. For example, carbon has three naturally occurring isotopes: all of its atoms\nIn chemistry, a group (also known as a family) is a column of elements in the periodic table of the chemical elements. There are 18 numbered groups in the periodic table; the 14 f-block columns, between groups 2 and 3, are not numbered. The elements in a group have similar physical or chemical characteristics of the outermost electron shells of their atoms (i.e., the same core charge), because most chemical properties are dominated by the orbital location of the outermost electron.\nThe modern numbering system of \"group 1\" to \"group 18\" has been recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) since 1988. The 1-18 system is based on each atom's s, p and d electrons beyond those in atoms of the preceding noble gas. Two older incompatible naming schemes can assign the same number to different groups depending on the system being used. The older schemes were used by the Chemical Abstract Service (CAS, more popular in the United States), and by IUPAC before 1988 (more popular in Europe). The system of eighteen groups is generally accepted by the chemistry community, but some dissent exists about membership of elements number 1 and 2 (hydrogen and helium). Similar variation on the inner transition metals continues to exist in textbooks, although the correct positioning has been known since 1948 and was twice endorsed by IUPAC in 1988 (together with the 1–18 numbering) and 2021.\nGroups may also be identified using their topmost element, or have a specific name. For example, group 16 is also described as the \"oxygen group\" and as the \"chalcogens\". An exception is the \"iron group\", which usually refers to group 8, but in chemistry may also mean iron, cobalt, and nickel, or some other set of elements with similar chemical properties. In astrophysics and nuclear physics, it usually refers to iron, cobalt, nickel, chromium, and manganese.\n\n\n== Group names ==\nModern group names are numbers 1–18, with the 14 f-block columns remaining unnumbered (together making the 32 columns in the periodic table). Also, trivial names (like halogens) are common. In history, several sets of group names have been used, based on Roman numberings I–VIII, and \"A\" and \"B\" suffixes.\n\n\n=== List of group names ===\n\n^f  Coinage metals: authors differ on whether roentgenium (Rg) is considered a coinage metal. It is in group 11, like the other coinage metals, and is expected to be chemically similar to gold. On the other hand, being extremely radioactive and short-lived, it cannot actually be used for coinage as the name suggests, and on that basis it is sometimes excluded.\n^b  triels (group 13), from Greek tri: three, III\n^c  tetrels (group 14), from Greek tetra: four, IV\n^n  pentel (group 15), from Greek penta: five, V\n\n\n== CAS and old IUPAC numbering (A/B) ==\nTwo earlier group number systems exist: CAS (Chemical Abstracts Service) and old IUPAC. Both use numerals (Arabic or Roman) and letters A and B. Both systems agree on the numbers. The numbers indicate approximately the highest oxidation number of the elements in that group, and so indicate similar chemistry with other elements with the same numeral. The number proceeds in a linearly increasing fashion for the most part, once on the left of the table, and once on the right (see List of oxidation states of the elements), with some irregularities in the transition metals. However, the two systems use the letters differently. For example, potassium (K) has one valence electron. Therefore, it is located in group 1. Calcium (Ca) is in group 2, for it contains two valence electrons.\nIn the old IUPAC system the letters A and B were designated to the left (A) and right (B) part of the table, while in the CAS system the letters A and B are designated to main group elements (A) and transition elements (B). The old IUPAC system was frequently used in Europe, while the CAS is most common in America. The new IUPAC scheme was developed to replace both systems as they confusingly used the same name\nA block of the periodic table is a set of elements unified by the atomic orbitals their valence electrons or vacancies lie in. The term seems to have been first used by Charles Janet. Each block is named after its characteristic orbital: s-block, p-block, d-block, f-block and g-block.\nThe block names (s, p, d, and f) are derived from the spectroscopic notation for the value of an electron's azimuthal quantum number: sharp (0), principal (1), diffuse (2), and fundamental (3). Succeeding notations proceed in alphabetical order, as g, h, etc., though elements that would belong in such blocks have not yet been found.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nThere is an approximate correspondence between this nomenclature of blocks, based on electronic configuration, and sets of elements based on chemical properties. The s-block and p-block together are usually considered main-group elements, the d-block corresponds to the transition metals, and the f-block corresponds to the inner transition metals and encompasses nearly all of the lanthanides (like lanthanum, praseodymium and dysprosium) and the actinides (like actinium, uranium and einsteinium).\nThe group 12 elements zinc, cadmium, and mercury are sometimes regarded as main group, rather than transition group, because they are chemically and physically more similar to the p-block elements than the other d-block elements. The group 3 elements are occasionally considered main group elements due to their similarities to the s-block elements. However, they remain d-block elements even when considered to be main group.\nGroups (columns) in the f-block (between groups 2 and 3) are not numbered.\nHelium is an s-block element, with its outer (and only) electrons in the 1s atomic orbital, although its chemical properties are more similar to the p-block noble gases in group 18 due to its full shell.\n\n\n=== s-block ===\n\nThe s-block, with the s standing for \"sharp\" and azimuthal quantum number 0, is on the left side of the conventional periodic table and is composed of elements from the first two columns plus one element in the rightmost column, the nonmetals hydrogen and helium and the alkali metals (in group 1) and alkaline earth metals (group 2). Their general valence configuration is ns1–2. Helium is an s-element, but nearly always finds its place to the far right in group 18, above the p-element neon. Each row of the table has two s-elements.\nThe metals of the s-block (from the second period onwards) are mostly soft and have generally low melting and boiling points. Most impart colour to a flame.\nChemically, all s-elements except helium are highly reactive. Metals of the s-block are highly electropositive and often form essentially ionic compounds with nonmetals, especially with the highly electronegative halogen nonmetals.\n\n\n=== p-block ===\nThe p-block, with the p standing for \"principal\" and azimuthal quantum number 1, is on the right side of the standard periodic table and encompasses elements in groups 13 to 18. Their general electronic configuration is ns2 np1–6. Helium, though being the first element in group 18, is not included in the p-block. Each row of the table has a place for six p-elements except for the first row (which has none).\n\nThis block is the only one having all three types of elements: metals, nonmetals, and metalloids. The p-block elements can be described on a group-by-group basis as: group 13, the icosagens; 14, the crystallogens; 15, the pnictogens; 16, the chalcogens; 17, the halogens; and 18, the helium group, composed of the noble gases (excluding helium) and oganesson. Alternatively, the p-block can be described as containing post-transition metals; metalloids; reactive nonmetals including the halogens; and noble gases (excluding helium).\nThe p-block elements are unified by the fact that their valence (outermost) electrons are in the p orbital. The p orbital consists of six lobed shapes coming from a central point at evenly spaced angles. The p orbital can hold a maximum of \nAn extended periodic table theorizes about chemical elements beyond those currently known and proven. The element with the highest atomic number known is oganesson (Z = 118), which completes the seventh period (row) in the periodic table. All elements in the eighth period and beyond thus remain purely hypothetical.\nElements beyond 118 will be placed in additional periods when discovered, laid out (as with the existing periods) to illustrate periodically recurring trends in the properties of the elements. Any additional periods are expected to contain more elements than the seventh period, as they are calculated to have an additional so-called g-block, containing at least 18 elements with partially filled g-orbitals in each period. An eight-period table containing this block was suggested by Glenn T. Seaborg in 1969. The first element of the g-block may have atomic number 121, and thus would have the systematic name unbiunium. Despite many searches, no elements in this region have been synthesized or discovered in nature.\nAccording to the orbital approximation in quantum mechanical descriptions of atomic structure, the g-block would correspond to elements with partially filled g-orbitals, but spin–orbit coupling effects reduce the validity of the orbital approximation substantially for elements of high atomic number. Seaborg's version of the extended period had the heavier elements following the pattern set by lighter elements, as it did not take into account relativistic effects. Models that take relativistic effects into account predict that the pattern will be broken. Pekka Pyykkö and Burkhard Fricke used computer modeling to calculate the positions of elements up to Z = 172, and found that several were displaced from the Madelung rule. As a result of uncertainty and variability in predictions of chemical and physical properties of elements beyond 120, there is currently no consensus on their placement in the extended periodic table.\nElements in this region are likely to be highly unstable with respect to radioactive decay and undergo alpha decay or spontaneous fission with extremely short half-lives, though element 126 is hypothesized to be within an island of stability that is resistant to fission but not to alpha decay. Other islands of stability beyond the known elements may also be possible, including one theorised around element 164, though the extent of stabilizing effects from closed nuclear shells is uncertain. It is not clear how many elements beyond the expected island of stability are physically possible, whether period 8 is complete, or if there is a period 9. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) defines an element to exist if its lifetime is longer than 10−14 seconds (0.01 picoseconds, or 10 femtoseconds), which is the time it takes for the nucleus to form an electron cloud.\nAs early as 1940, it was noted that a simplistic interpretation of the relativistic Dirac equation runs into problems with electron orbitals at Z > 1/α ≈ 137, suggesting that neutral atoms cannot exist beyond element 137, and that a periodic table of elements based on electron orbitals therefore breaks down at this point. On the other hand, a more rigorous analysis calculates the analogous limit to be Z ≈ 168–172 where the 1s subshell dives into the Dirac sea, and that it is instead not neutral atoms that cannot exist beyond this point, but bare nuclei, thus posing no obstacle to the further extension of the periodic system. Atoms beyond this critical atomic number are called supercritical atoms.\n\n\n== History ==\nElements beyond the actinides were first proposed to exist as early as 1895, when Danish chemist Hans Peter Jørgen Julius Thomsen predicted that thorium and uranium formed part of a 32-element period which would end at a chemically inactive element with atomic weight 292 (not far from the 294 for the only known isotope of oganesson). In 1913, Swedish physicist Johannes Rydberg similarly predicted that the ne\nSince Dimitri Mendeleev formulated the periodic law in 1871, and published an associated periodic table of chemical elements, authors have experimented with varying types of periodic tables including for teaching, aesthetic or philosophical purposes.\nEarlier, in 1869, Mendeleev had mentioned different layouts including short, medium, and even cubic forms. It appeared to him that the latter (three-dimensional) form would be the most natural approach but that \"attempts at such a construction have not led to any real results\". On spiral periodic tables, \"Mendeleev...steadfastly refused to depict the system as [such]...His objection was that he could not express this function mathematically.\"\n\n\n== Typology ==\nIn 1934, George Quam, a chemistry professor at Long Island University, New York, and Mary Quam, a librarian at the New York Public Library compiled and published a bibliography of 133 periodic tables using a five-fold typology: I. short; II. long (including triangular); III. spiral; IV. helical, and V. miscellaneous. \nIn 1952, Moeller expressed disdain as to the many types of periodic table:\n\nThe literature is replete with suggested (and discarded) modifications of the M periodic table. In fact so many modifications have appeared that one is tempted to conclude that practically every author has his [sic] own concept of what a workable arrangement must be. Unfortunately, the majority of the tabulations proposed are either unwieldy or utterly worthless, and only a few valuable suggestions have been made. Geometry does not permit of an arrangement which is sufficiently ideal to serve all the required purposes equally well. Thus the many three-dimensional models, embracing globes, helices, cones, prisms, castles, etc., are interesting but lacking in utility. To a lesser extent, the more involved two-dimensional arrangements do little toward solving the difficulty, and essentially the only suggestions as to modifications which are truly constructive are those centering in reflection of electronic configurations.\nCertainly the most useful of these modifications, and at the same time one of the earliest to be proposed, is the so-called long or [18-column]...table.\nIn 1954, Tomkeieff referred to the three principle types of periodic table as helical, rectilinear, and spiral. He added that, \"unfortunately there also a number of freaks\".\nIn 1974 Edward Mazurs, a professor of chemistry, published a survey and analysis of about seven hundred periodic tables that had been published in the preceding one hundred years; he recognized short, medium, long, helical, spiral, series tables, and tables not classified.\nIn 1999 Mark Leach, a chemist, inaugurated the INTERNET database of Periodic Tables. It has over 1200 entries as of May 2023. While the database is a chronological compilation, specific types of periodic tables that can be searched for are spiral and helical; 3-dimensional; and miscellaneous.\nFor convenience, periodic tables may be typified as either: 1. short; 2. triangular; 3. medium; 4. long; 5. continuous (circular, spiral, lemniscate, or helical); 6. folding; or 7. spatial. Tables that defy easy classification are counted as type 8. unclassified.\n\n\n=== Short ===\n\nShort tables have around eight columns. This form became popular following the publication of Mendeleev's eight-column periodic table in 1871.\nAlso shown in this section is a modernized version of the same table.\nMendeleev and others who discovered chemical periodicity in the 1860s had noticed that when the elements were arranged in order of their atomic weights there was as an approximate repetition of physiochemical properties after every eight elements. Consequently, Mendeleev organized the elements known at that time into a table with eight columns. He used the table to predict the properties of then unknown elements. While his hit rate was less than 50% it was his successes that propelled the widespread acceptance of the idea of a periodic table of the chemical ele\nA period on the periodic table is a row of chemical elements. All elements in a row have the same number of electron shells. Each next element in a period has one more proton and is less metallic than its predecessor. Arranged this way, elements in the same group (column) have similar chemical and physical properties, reflecting the periodic law. For example, the halogens lie in the second-to-last group (group 17) and share similar properties, such as high reactivity and the tendency to gain one electron to arrive at a noble-gas electronic configuration. As of 2022, a total of 118 elements have been discovered and confirmed.\n\nModern quantum mechanics explains these periodic trends in properties in terms of electron shells. As atomic number increases, shells fill with electrons in approximately the order shown in the ordering rule diagram. The filling of each shell corresponds to a row in the table.\nIn the f-block and p-block of the periodic table, elements within the same period generally do not exhibit trends and similarities in properties (vertical trends down groups are more significant). However, in the d-block, trends across periods become significant, and in the f-block elements show a high degree of similarity across periods.\n\n\n== Periods ==\nThere are currently seven complete periods in the periodic table, comprising the 118 known elements. Any new elements will be placed into an eighth period; see extended periodic table. The elements are colour-coded below by their block: red for the s-block, yellow for the p-block, blue for the d-block, and green for the f-block.\n\n\n=== Period 1 ===\n\nThe first period contains fewer elements than any other, with only two, hydrogen and helium. They therefore do not follow the octet rule, but rather a duplet rule. Chemically, helium behaves like a noble gas, and thus is taken to be part of the group 18 elements. However, in terms of its nuclear structure it belongs to the s-block, and is therefore sometimes classified as a group 2 element, or simultaneously both 2 and 18. Hydrogen readily loses and gains an electron, and so behaves chemically as both a group 1 and a group 17 element.\n\nHydrogen (H) is the most abundant of the chemical elements, constituting roughly 75% of the universe's elemental mass. Ionized hydrogen is just a proton. Stars in the main sequence are mainly composed of hydrogen in its plasma state. Elemental hydrogen is relatively rare on Earth, and is industrially produced from hydrocarbons such as methane. Hydrogen can form compounds with most elements and is present in water and most organic compounds.\nHelium (He) exists only as a gas except in extreme conditions. It is the second-lightest element and is the second-most abundant in the universe. Most helium was formed during the Big Bang, but new helium is created through nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars. On Earth, helium is relatively rare, only occurring as a byproduct of the natural decay of some radioactive elements. Such 'radiogenic' helium is trapped within natural gas in concentrations of up to seven percent by volume.\n\n\n=== Period 2 ===\n\nPeriod 2 elements involve the 2s and 2p orbitals. They include the biologically most essential elements besides hydrogen: carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen.\n\nLithium (Li) is the lightest metal and the least dense solid element. In its non-ionized state it is one of the most reactive elements, and so is only ever found naturally in compounds. It is the heaviest primordial element forged in large quantities during the Big Bang.\nBeryllium (Be) has one of the highest melting points of all the light metals. Small amounts of beryllium were synthesised during the Big Bang, although most of it decayed or reacted further within stars to create larger nuclei, like carbon, nitrogen or oxygen. Beryllium is classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a group 1 carcinogen. Between 1% and 15% of people are sensitive to beryllium and may develop an inflammatory reaction in t\nThe periodic table is an arrangement of the chemical elements, structured by their atomic number, electron configuration and recurring chemical properties. In the basic form, elements are presented in order of increasing atomic number, in the reading sequence. Then, rows and columns are created by starting new rows and inserting blank cells, so that rows (periods) and columns (groups) show elements with recurring properties (called periodicity). For example, all elements in group (column) 18 are noble gases that are largely—though not completely—unreactive.\nThe history of the periodic table reflects over two centuries of growth in the understanding of the chemical and physical properties of the elements, with major contributions made by Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier, Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner, John Newlands, Julius Lothar Meyer, Dmitri Mendeleev, Glenn T. Seaborg, and others.\n\n\n== Early history ==\n\nAround 330 BCE, the Greek philosopher Aristotle proposed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more roots, an idea originally suggested by the Sicilian philosopher Empedocles. The four roots, which the Athenian philosopher Plato called elements, were earth, water, air and fire. Similar ideas existed in other ancient traditions, such as Indian philosophy with five elements: Earth, water, fire, air and aether collectively called 'pañca bhūta'. \nOf the chemical elements shown on the periodic table, nine – carbon, sulfur, iron, copper, silver, tin, gold, mercury, and lead – have been known since antiquity, as they are found in their native form and are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools. Five more elements were known in the age of alchemy: zinc, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth. Platinum was known to pre-Columbian South Americans, but knowledge of it did not reach Europe until the 16th century.\n\n\n== First categorizations ==\n\nThe history of the periodic table is also a history of the discovery of the chemical elements. The first person in recorded history to discover a new element was Hennig Brand, a bankrupt German merchant. Brand tried to discover the philosopher's stone—a mythical object that was supposed to turn inexpensive base metals into gold. In 1669, or later, his experiments with distilled human urine resulted in the production of a glowing white substance, which he called \"cold fire\" (kaltes Feuer). He kept his discovery secret until 1680, when Anglo-Irish chemist Robert Boyle rediscovered phosphorus and published his findings. The discovery of phosphorus helped to raise the question of what it meant for a substance (any given variety of matter) to be an element, in a world where versions of atomic theory were only speculative and later understandings of the nature of substances were only beginning to become possible.\nIn 1661, Boyle defined elements as \"those primitive and simple Bodies of which the mixt ones are said to be composed, and into which they are ultimately resolved.\"\nIn 1718, Étienne François Geoffroy's Affinity Table made use of several aspects — (1) tabular grouping and (2) correlation with chemical affinity — that would later be reprised. \n\nIn 1789, French chemist Antoine Lavoisier wrote Traité Élémentaire de Chimie (Elementary Treatise of Chemistry), which is considered to be the first modern textbook about chemistry. Lavoisier defined an element as a substance whose smallest units cannot be broken down into a simpler substance. Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, phosphorus, mercury, zinc and sulfur, which formed the basis for the modern list of elements. Lavoisier's list also included \"light\" and \"caloric\", which at the time were believed to be material substances. He classified these substances into metals and nonmetals. While many leading chemists refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the Elementary Treatise was written well enough to convince the younger \nHydrogen is a chemical element; it has symbol H and atomic number 1. It is the lightest element and, at standard conditions, is a gas of diatomic molecules with the formula H2, sometimes called dihydrogen, but more commonly called hydrogen gas, molecular hydrogen or simply hydrogen. It is colorless, odorless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. Constituting about 75% of all normal matter, hydrogen is the most abundant chemical element in the universe. Stars, including the Sun, mainly consist of hydrogen in a plasma state, while on Earth, hydrogen is found in water, organic compounds, as dihydrogen, and in other molecular forms. The most common isotope of hydrogen (protium, 1H) consists of one proton, one electron, and no neutrons.\nIn the early universe, the formation of hydrogen's protons occurred in the first second after the Big Bang; neutral hydrogen atoms only formed about 370,000 years later during the recombination epoch as the universe cooled and plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to protons. Hydrogen, typically nonmetallic except under extreme pressure, readily forms covalent bonds with most nonmetals, contributing to the formation of compounds like water and various organic substances. Its role is crucial in acid-base reactions, which mainly involve proton exchange among soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of either a negatively charged anion, where it is known as hydride, or as a positively charged cation, H+. The cation, usually just a proton (symbol p), exhibits specific behavior in aqueous solutions and in ionic compounds involves screening of its electric charge by surrounding polar molecules or anions. Hydrogen's unique position as the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be directly solved, has significantly contributed to the foundational principles of quantum mechanics through the exploration of its energetics and chemical bonding.\nHydrogen gas was first produced artificially in the early 16th century by reacting acids with metals. Henry Cavendish, in 1766–81, identified hydrogen gas as a distinct substance and discovered its property of producing water when burned; hence its name means \"water-former\" in Greek.\nMost hydrogen production occurs through steam reforming of natural gas; a smaller portion comes from energy-intensive methods such as the electrolysis of water. Its main industrial uses include fossil fuel processing, such as hydrocracking, and ammonia production, with emerging uses in fuel cells for electricity generation and as a heat source. When used in fuel cells, hydrogen's only emission at point of use is water vapor, though combustion can produce nitrogen oxides. Hydrogen's interaction with metals may cause embrittlement.\n\n\n== Properties ==\n\n\n=== Combustion ===\n\nHydrogen gas is highly flammable:\n\n2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(l) (572 kJ/2 mol = 286 kJ/mol = 141.865 MJ/kg)\nEnthalpy of combustion: −286 kJ/mol.\nHydrogen gas forms explosive mixtures with air in concentrations from 4–74% and with chlorine at 5–95%. The hydrogen autoignition temperature, the temperature of spontaneous ignition in air, is 500 °C (932 °F).\n\n\n==== Flame ====\nPure hydrogen-oxygen flames emit ultraviolet light and with high oxygen mix are nearly invisible to the naked eye, as illustrated by the faint plume of the Space Shuttle Main Engine, compared to the highly visible plume of a Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster, which uses an ammonium perchlorate composite. The detection of a burning hydrogen leak, may require a flame detector; such leaks can be very dangerous. Hydrogen flames in other conditions are blue, resembling blue natural gas flames. The destruction of the Hindenburg airship was a notorious example of hydrogen combustion and the cause is still debated. The visible flames in the photographs were the result of carbon compounds in the airship skin burning.\n\n\n==== Reactants ====\nH2 is unreactive compared to diatomic elements such as halogens or oxygen.\nThe chemical elements can be broadly divided into metals, metalloids, and nonmetals according to their shared physical and chemical properties. All elemental metals have a shiny appearance (at least when freshly polished); are good conductors of heat and electricity; form alloys with other metallic elements; and have at least one basic oxide. Metalloids are metallic-looking, often brittle solids that are either semiconductors or exist in semiconducting forms, and have amphoteric or weakly acidic oxides. Typical elemental nonmetals have a dull, coloured or colourless appearance; are often brittle when solid; are poor conductors of heat and electricity; and have acidic oxides. Most or some elements in each category share a range of other properties; a few elements have properties that are either anomalous given their category, or otherwise extraordinary.\n\n\n== Properties ==\n\n\n=== Metals ===\n\nElemental metals appear lustrous (beneath any patina); form mixtures (alloys) when combined with other metals; tend to lose or share electrons when they react with other substances; and each forms at least one predominantly basic oxide.\nMost metals are silvery looking, high density, relatively soft and easily deformed solids with good electrical and thermal conductivity, closely packed structures, low ionisation energies and electronegativities, and are found naturally in combined states.\nSome metals appear coloured (Cu, Cs, Au), have low densities (e.g. Be, Al) or very high melting points (e.g. W, Nb), are liquids at or near room temperature (e.g. Hg, Ga), are brittle (e.g. Os, Bi), not easily machined (e.g. Ti, Re), or are noble (hard to oxidise, e.g. Au, Pt), or have nonmetallic structures (Mn and Ga are structurally analogous to, respectively, white P and I).\nMetals comprise the large majority of the elements, and can be subdivided into several different categories. From left to right in the periodic table, these categories include the highly reactive alkali metals; the less-reactive alkaline earth metals, lanthanides, and radioactive actinides; the archetypal transition metals; and the physically and chemically weak post-transition metals. Specialized subcategories such as the refractory metals and the noble metals also exist.\n\n\n=== Metalloids ===\n\nMetalloids are metallic-looking often brittle solids; tend to share electrons when they react with other substances; have weakly acidic or amphoteric oxides; and are usually found naturally in combined states.\nMost are semiconductors, and moderate thermal conductors, and have structures that are more open than those of most metals.\nSome metalloids (As, Sb) conduct electricity like metals.\nThe metalloids, as the smallest major category of elements, are not subdivided further.\n\n\n=== Nonmetals ===\n\nNonmetallic elements have open structures; tend to gain or share electrons when they react with other substances; and do not form distinctly basic oxides.\nMost are gases at room temperature; have relatively low densities; are poor electrical and thermal conductors; have relatively high ionisation energies and electronegativities; form acidic oxides; and are found naturally in uncombined states in large amounts.\nSome nonmetals (black P, S, and Se) are brittle solids at room temperature (although each of these also have malleable, pliable or ductile allotropes).\nFrom left to right in the periodic table, the nonmetals can be divided into the reactive nonmetals and the noble gases. The reactive nonmetals near the metalloids show some incipient metallic character, such as the metallic appearance of graphite, black phosphorus, selenium and iodine. The noble gases are almost completely inert.\n\n\n== Comparison of properties ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nThe characteristic properties of elemental metals and nonmetals are quite distinct, as shown in the table below. Metalloids, straddling the metal-nonmetal border, are mostly distinct from either, but in a few properties resemble one or the other, as shown in the shadin\nConfigurations of elements 109 and above are not available. Predictions from reliable sources have been used for these elements.\nGrayed out electron numbers indicate subshells filled to their maximum.\nBracketed noble gas symbols on the left represent inner configurations that are the same in each period. Written out, these are:\nHe, 2, helium : 1s2\nNe, 10, neon : 1s2 2s2 2p6\nAr, 18, argon : 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6\nKr, 36, krypton : 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d10 4p6\nXe, 54, xenon : 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d10 4p6 5s2 4d10 5p6\nRn, 86, radon : 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d10 4p6 5s2 4d10 5p6 6s2 4f14 5d10 6p6\nOg, 118, oganesson : 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d10 4p6 5s2 4d10 5p6 6s2 4f14 5d10 6p6 7s2 5f14 6d10 7p6\nNote that these electron configurations are given for neutral atoms in the gas phase, which are not the same as the electron configurations for the same atoms in chemical environments. In many cases, multiple configurations are within a small range of energies and the small irregularities that arise in the d- and f-blocks are quite irrelevant chemically. The construction of the periodic table ignores these irregularities and is based on ideal electron configurations.\nNote the non-linear shell ordering, which comes about due to the different energies of smaller and larger shells.\n\n\n== References ==\nSee list of sources at Electron configurations of the elements (data page).\nIn chemistry, periodic trends are specific patterns present in the periodic table that illustrate different aspects of certain elements when grouped by period and/or group. They were discovered by the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in 1863. Major periodic trends include atomic radius, ionization energy, electron affinity, electronegativity, valency and metallic character. These trends exist because of the similar electron configurations of the elements within their respective groups or periods; they reflect the periodic nature of the elements. These trends give a qualitative assessment of the properties of each element.\n\n\n== Summary of trends ==\n\n\n== Atomic radius ==\n\nThe atomic radius is the distance from the atomic nucleus to the outermost electron orbital in an atom. In general, the atomic radius decreases as we move from left to right in a period, and it increases when we go down a group. This is because in periods, the valence electrons are in the same outermost shell. The atomic number increases within the same period while moving from left to right, which in turn increases the effective nuclear charge. The increase in attractive forces reduces the atomic radius of elements. When we move down the group, the atomic radius increases due to the addition of a new shell.\n\n\n== Ionization energy ==\n\nThe ionization energy is the minimum amount of energy that an electron in a gaseous atom or ion has to absorb to come out of the influence of the attracting force of the nucleus. It is also referred to as ionization potential. The first ionization energy is the amount of energy that is required to remove the first electron from a neutral atom. The energy needed to remove the second electron from the neutral atom is called the second ionization energy and so on.\nTrend-wise, as one moves from left to right across a period in the modern periodic table, the ionization energy increases as the nuclear charge increases and the atomic size decreases. The decrease in the atomic size results in a more potent force of attraction between the electrons and the nucleus. However, suppose one moves down in a group. In that case, the ionization energy decreases as atomic size increases due to adding a valence shell, thereby diminishing the nucleus's attraction to electrons.\n\n\n== Electron affinity ==\n\nThe energy released when an electron is added to a neutral gaseous atom to form an anion is known as electron affinity. Trend-wise, as one progresses from left to right across a period, the electron affinity will increase as the nuclear charge increases and the atomic size decreases resulting in a more potent force of attraction of the nucleus and the added electron. However, as one moves down in a group, electron affinity decreases because atomic size increases due to the addition of a valence shell, thereby weakening the nucleus's attraction to electrons. Although it may seem that fluorine should have the greatest electron affinity, its small size generates enough repulsion among the electrons, resulting in chlorine having the highest electron affinity in the halogen family.\n\n\n== Electronegativity ==\n\nThe tendency of an atom in a molecule to attract the shared pair of electrons towards itself is known as electronegativity. It is a dimensionless quantity because it is only a tendency. The most commonly used scale to measure electronegativity was designed by Linus Pauling. The scale has been named the Pauling scale in his honour. According to this scale, fluorine is the most electronegative element, while cesium is the least electronegative element.\nTrend-wise, as one moves from left to right across a period in the modern periodic table, the electronegativity increases as the nuclear charge increases and the atomic size decreases. However, if one moves down in a group, the electronegativity decreases as atomic size increases due to the addition of a valence shell, thereby decreasing the atom's attraction to electrons.\nHowever, in group XIII (Boron fam\nThe Periodic Table (Italian: Il sistema periodico) is a 1975 short story collection by Primo Levi, named after the periodic table in chemistry. In 2006, the Royal Institution of Great Britain named it the best science book ever.\n\n\n== Content ==\nThe stories are autobiographical episodes based on the author's experiences as a Jewish-Italian doctoral-level chemist under the Fascist regime in Italy and afterwards. They include various themes that follow a chronological sequence: his ancestry; his study of chemistry and practising the profession in wartime Italy; a pair of imaginative tales he wrote at that time, and his subsequent experiences as an anti-Fascist partisan; his arrest and imprisonment, interrogation, and internment in the Fossoli di Carpi and Auschwitz camps; and postwar life as an industrial chemist. \nEach of the twenty-one stories in the book bears the name of a chemical element as its title and has a connection to the element in some way.\n\n\n== Chapters ==\n\"Argon\" – The author's childhood, the community of Piedmontese Jews and their language. Levi uses the unreactive gas Argon as a metaphor for his ancestors' relative inactivity compared with other European Jewish communities, culminating in the example of an uncle who stayed in bed for over 20 years.\n\"Hydrogen\" – Two children experiment with electrolysis. The primordial potential of hydrogen, first and simplest of the elements, is used to juxtapose Levi's idealism with the prosaic expectations of his childhood friend Enrico.\n\"Zinc\" – Laboratory experiments in a university. Zinc, which Levi presents as \"a boring metal,\" dissolves readily in acid when impure, but resists dissolution obstinately when pure, which Levi uses to compare the respective strengths of purity and impurity.\n\"Iron\" – The author's adolescence, between the racial laws and the Alps, and the inspirational example of a mountain climber turned resistance hero whose rugged strength and preference for actions over words Levi represents with the imagery of iron.\n\"Potassium\" – An experience in the laboratory with unexpected results. Levi assumes that potassium will act in similar ways to Sodium, which is directly above it in the periodic table, resulting in a conflagration which teaches Levi to \"distrust the Almost-the-Same\" and reminds him of hidden differences which, like railroad junctions, can amplify small apparent differences into radically divergent consequences.\n\"Nickel\" – Inside the chemical laboratories of a mine. Levi reflects on the magical reputations of mines, as he is hired to attempt to extract Nickel from the waste elements of an asbestos mine. Nickel is named after an imp or sprite, reflecting its deception of miners who were searching for other substances. He succeeds and is elated, but later sadly reflects that the extracted materials would have been used to produce armor plates and artillery shells for the Fascists and Nazis.\n\"Lead\" – The narrative of a primitive metallurgist, whose family specialises in obtaining poisonous lead, purchasing wealth at the cost of short lives (fiction)\n\"Mercury\" – A tale of populating a remote and desolate island, in which mercury found in a cave is used to procure wives for the island's inhabitants (fiction)\n\"Phosphorus\" – An experience on a job in the chemical industry. Levi is asked to investigate whether phosphorus is effective in managing diabetes, a pseudoscientific theory proposed by a senior Nazi chemist. Levi reflects on the impossibility of changing a superior's mind, and relates a melancholy episode in which he helps a woman he is attracted to, but unable to be with due to his Jewish ethnicity, begin a relationship with another man.\n\"Gold\" – A story of imprisonment. Having joined the Resistance and been captured, Levi meets a fanatical fascist whose intentions remain pure, though brutal, because of his very ignorance. He encounters a smuggler who prospects gold from a nearby river, and envies him his life of unmolested freedom.\n\"Cerium\" – Su\nFor elements that are solid at standard temperature and pressure the first table gives the crystalline structure of the most thermodynamically stable form(s) in those conditions. Each element is shaded by a color representing its respective Bravais lattice, except that all orthorhombic lattices are grouped together.\n\n\n== Standard temperature and pressure ==\n\n\n== Melting point and standard pressure ==\nThe second table gives the most stable structure of each element at its melting point. (H, He, N, O, F, Ne, Cl, Ar, Kr, Xe, and Rn are gases at STP; Br and Hg are liquids at STP.) Note that helium does not have a melting point at atmospheric pressure, but it adopts a magnesium-type hexagonal close-packed structure under high pressure.\n\n\n== Predicted structures ==\nPredictions are given for elements 85–87, 100–113 and 118; all but radon have not been produced in bulk. Probably Cn and Fl would be liquids at STP (ignoring radioactive self-heating concerns). Calculations have difficulty replicating the experimentally known bcc structures of the stable alkali metals, and the same problem affects Fr (87); nonetheless, it is probably also bcc. The latest predictions for Fl (114) could not distinguish between face-centred cubic and hexagonal close-packed structures, which were predicted to be close in energy. No predictions are available for elements 115–117.\n\n\n== Structure types ==\nThe following is a list of structure types which appear in the tables above. Regarding the number of atoms in the unit cell, structures in the rhombohedral lattice system have a rhombohedral primitive cell and have trigonal point symmetry but are also often also described in terms of an equivalent but nonprimitive hexagonal unit cell with three times the volume and three times the number of atoms.\n\n\n=== Close packed metal structures ===\n\nThe observed crystal structures of many metals can be described as a nearly mathematical close-packing of equal spheres. A simple model for both of these is to assume that the metal atoms are spherical and are packed together as closely as possible. In closest packing, every atom has 12 equidistant nearest neighbours, and therefore a coordination number of 12. If the close packed structures are considered as being built of layers of spheres, then the difference between hexagonal close packing and face-centred cubic is how each layer is positioned relative to others. The following types can be viewed as a regular buildup of close-packed layers:\n\nMg type (hexagonal close packing) has alternate layers positioned directly above/below each other: A,B,A,B,...\nCu type (face-centered cubic) has every third layer directly above/below each other: A,B,C,A,B,C,...\nα-La type (double hexagonal close packing) has layers directly above/below each other, A,B,A,C,A,B,A,C,.... of period length 4 like an alternative mixture of fcc and hcp packing.\nα-Sm type has a period of 9 layers A,B,A,B,C,B,C,A,C,...\nPrecisely speaking, the structures of many of the elements in the groups above are slightly distorted from the ideal closest packing. While they retain the lattice symmetry as the ideal structure, they often have nonideal c/a ratios for their unit cell. Less precisely speaking, there are also other elements are nearly close-packed but have distortions which have at least one broken symmetry with respect to the close-packed structure:\n\nIn type is slightly distorted from a cubic close packed structure\nα-Pa type is distorted from a hexagonal close packed structure\n\n\n== See also ==\nCrystal structure\nAllotropy\n\n\n== References ==\n\nGeneral\nP.A.

It consists of a series of videos about chemical elements and the periodic table, with additional videos on other topics in chemistry and related fields. They are published on YouTube and produced by Brady Haran, a former BBC video journalist, mainly featuring Sir Martyn Poliakoff, Peter Licence, Stephen Liddle, Debbie Kays, Neil Barnes, Sam Tang, and other scientists at the University of Nottingham.\n\n\n== Development ==\nThe project began recording on 9 June 2008 and the initial videos were completed on 17 July 2008. The collection includes videos, each just a few minutes long, for all 118 known elements with a video for each element, as well as many additional supplemental chemistry videos. The 118 element videos and introduction videos were all shot unscripted in June and July 2008.\nSince the initial videos were completed in 2008 the team has been refining and uploading revised versions of the videos with new video and in higher resolutions. A key example of this revising is with the xenon video that was redone in honour of professor Neil Bartlett who died on 5 August 2008; Bartlett prepared one of the first xenon compounds, xenon hexafluoroplatinate.\n\n\n== Content ==\nPoliakoff is the most visible presenter on the videos; his hair, reminiscent of Albert Einstein or a mad scientist, is frequently commented upon. The combination of the professor's hair and amusing experiments has made these videos quite popular. Although uncertain what to think about the attention given to his hair, Professor Poliakoff is excited with the success of the videos, stating \"With a few hours of work, I have lectured to more students than I have reached in my entire career.\" The YouTube channel as of December 2021, has over 1.5 million subscribers and the videos have surpassed 260 million views. The YouTube channel is now one of the most popular chemistry related channels on all of YouTube. The producers of the videos have received praise from Nobel Laureates, chemistry professors, and the general public, says Professor Poliakoff. Chemistry Nobel Laureate Roald Hoffmann has even offered his praise of the videos, stating they \"are like the best reality show I've ever seen – the universe revealing itself, element by element.\" In 2019, Poliakoff was awarded the Royal Society of London Michael Faraday Prize for science communication for his work on the videos.\nThe videos feature various experiments and demonstrations of the elements, some too dangerous to be performed in a classroom. Though the presenters take appropriate precautions when doing such experiments and provide adequate warnings, some scientists have criticized the dangerous experiments fearing people might try them at home and get hurt. The intent of the videos is to bring chemistry to a new generation of students and to get them enthused about science and understand how chemists think and what chemists are trying to do. Many school teachers now incorporate these videos into their classes, and the professor has even recorded video responses to some of the students' questions. Some of the most popular videos are those of sodium, potassium, and uranium.\nThe Periodic Table of Videos team has also performed live. Their first performance was in May 2009 at the Broadway Media Centre in Nottingham; in July 2010 they performed at the EuroScience Open Forum (ESOF) in Turin, Italy.\n\n\n== Financing ==\nA grant from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council of £25,249 was awarded on 19 January 2010 to extend the video library to include topical videos on molecules of general interest. The first of these new videos were on carbon dioxide and methane.\n\n\n== Videos ==\n\nThe Periodic Table of Videos has filmed at least one video for each of the 118 elements (from hydrogen to oganesson). They have also filmed several videos that discuss molecules such as D2O (heavy water) and sulfuric aci\nThe atomic number or nuclear charge number (symbol Z) of a chemical element is the charge number of its atomic nucleus. For ordinary nuclei composed of protons and neutrons, this is equal to the proton number (np) or the number of protons found in the nucleus of every atom of that element. The atomic number can be used to uniquely identify ordinary chemical elements. In an ordinary uncharged atom, the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons.\nFor an ordinary atom which contains protons, neutrons and electrons, the sum of the atomic number Z and the neutron number N gives the atom's atomic mass number A. Since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass (and the mass of the electrons is negligible for many purposes) and the mass defect of the nucleon binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass, the atomic mass of any atom, when expressed in daltons (making a quantity called the \"relative isotopic mass\"), is within 1% of the whole number A.\nAtoms with the same atomic number but different neutron numbers, and hence different mass numbers, are known as isotopes. A little more than three-quarters of naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes (see monoisotopic elements), and the average isotopic mass of an isotopic mixture for an element (called the relative atomic mass) in a defined environment on Earth determines the element's standard atomic weight. Historically, it was these atomic weights of elements (in comparison to hydrogen) that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the 19th century.\nThe conventional symbol Z comes from the German word Zahl 'number', which, before the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics, merely denoted an element's numerical place in the periodic table, whose order was then approximately, but not completely, consistent with the order of the elements by atomic weights. Only after 1915, with the suggestion and evidence that this Z number was also the nuclear charge and a physical characteristic of atoms, did the word Atomzahl (and its English equivalent atomic number) come into common use in this context.\nThe rules above do not always apply to exotic atoms which contain short-lived elementary particles other than protons, neutrons and electrons.\n\n\n== History ==\nBefore the development of the periodic table, the term \"atomic number\" typically meant the number of atoms in a given volume. Modern chemists prefer to use the concept of molarity. \nIn 1913, Antonius van den Broek proposed that the electric charge of an atomic nucleus, expressed as a multiplier of the elementary charge, was equal to the element's position on the periodic table, assuming no gaps in said table. Ernest Rutherford, referring to van den Broek's proposal, used the term \"atomic number\" to refer to an element's position on the periodic table. It was therefore Rutherford who, in a casual manner, defined atomic number as meaning an element's position on the periodic table.\n\n\n=== The periodic table and a natural number for each element ===\n\nThe periodic table of elements creates an ordering of the elements, and so they can be numbered in order.: 222 \nDmitri Mendeleev arranged his first periodic tables (first published on March 6, 1869) in order of atomic weight (\"Atomgewicht\"). However, in consideration of the elements' observed chemical properties, he changed the order slightly and placed tellurium (atomic weight 127.6) ahead of iodine (atomic weight 126.9). This placement is consistent with the modern practice of ordering the elements by proton number, Z, but that number was not known or suspected at the time.\nA simple numbering based on atomic weight position was never entirely satisfactory. In addition to the case of iodine and tellurium, several other pairs of elements (such as argon and potassium, cobalt and nickel) were later shown to have nearly identical or reversed atomic weights, thus requiring their placement in the periodic table to be determined by their chem\nIn chemistry, the valence (US spelling) or valency (British spelling) of an atom is a measure of its combining capacity with other atoms when it forms chemical compounds or molecules. Valence is generally understood to be the number of chemical bonds that each atom of a given chemical element typically forms. Double bonds are considered to be two bonds, triple bonds to be three, quadruple bonds to be four, quintuple bonds to be five and sextuple bonds to be six. In most compounds, the valence of hydrogen is 1, of oxygen is 2, of nitrogen is 3, and of carbon is 4. Valence is not to be confused with the related concepts of the coordination number, the oxidation state, or the number of valence electrons for a given atom.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe valence is the combining capacity of an atom of a given element, determined by the number of hydrogen atoms that it combines with. In methane, carbon has a valence of 4; in ammonia, nitrogen has a valence of 3; in water, oxygen has a valence of 2; and in hydrogen chloride, chlorine has a valence of 1. Chlorine, as it has a valence of one, can be substituted for hydrogen in many compounds. Phosphorus has a valence 3 in phosphine (PH3) and a valence of 5 in phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5), which shows that an element may exhibit more than one valence. The structural formula of a compound represents the connectivity of the atoms, with lines drawn between two atoms to represent bonds. The two tables below show examples of different compounds, their structural formulas, and the valences for each element of the compound.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nValence is defined by the IUPAC as:\n\nThe maximum number of univalent atoms (originally hydrogen or chlorine atoms) that may combine with an atom of the element under consideration, or with a fragment, or for which an atom of this element can be substituted.\nAn alternative modern description is:\n\nThe number of hydrogen atoms that can combine with an element in a binary hydride or twice the number of oxygen atoms combining with an element in its oxide or oxides.\nThis definition differs from the IUPAC definition as an element can be said to have more than one valence.\n\n\n== Historical development ==\nThe etymology of the words valence (plural valences) and valency (plural valencies) traces back to 1425, meaning \"extract, preparation\", from Latin valentia \"strength, capacity\", from the earlier valor \"worth, value\", and the chemical meaning referring to the \"combining power of an element\" is recorded from 1884, from German Valenz.\n\nThe concept of valence was developed in the second half of the 19th century and helped successfully explain the molecular structure of inorganic and organic compounds.\nThe quest for the underlying causes of valence led to the modern theories of chemical bonding, including the cubical atom (1902), Lewis structures (1916), valence bond theory (1927), molecular orbitals (1928), valence shell electron pair repulsion theory (1958), and all of the advanced methods of quantum chemistry.\nIn 1789, William Higgins published views on what he called combinations of \"ultimate\" particles, which foreshadowed the concept of valency bonds. If, for example, according to Higgins, the force between the ultimate particle of oxygen and the ultimate particle of nitrogen were 6, then the strength of the force would be divided accordingly, and likewise for the other combinations of ultimate particles (see illustration).\nThe exact inception, however, of the theory of chemical valencies can be traced to an 1852 paper by Edward Frankland, in which he combined the older radical theory with thoughts on chemical affinity to show that certain elements have the tendency to combine with other elements to form compounds containing 3, i.e., in the 3-atom groups (e.g., NO3, NH3, NI3, etc.) or 5, i.e., in the 5-atom groups (e.g., NO5, NH4O, PO5, etc.), equivalents of the attached elements. According to him, this is the manner in which their affinities are best satisfied, and b\nDmitri Mendeleev published a periodic table of the chemical elements in 1869 based on properties that appeared with some regularity as he laid out the elements from lightest to heaviest. When Mendeleev proposed his periodic table, he noted gaps in the table and predicted that then-unknown elements existed with properties appropriate to fill those gaps. He named them eka-boron, eka-aluminium, eka-silicon, and eka-manganese, with respective atomic masses of 44, 68, 72, and 100.\n\n\n== Prefixes ==\nTo give provisional names to his predicted elements, Dmitri Mendeleev used the prefixes eka- , dvi- or dwi-, and  tri-, from the Sanskrit names of digits 1, 2, and 3, depending upon whether the predicted element was one, two, or three places down from the known element of the same group in his table. For example, germanium was called eka-silicon until its discovery in 1886, and rhenium was called dvi-manganese before its discovery in 1926.\nThe eka- prefix was used by other theorists, and not only in Mendeleev's own predictions. Before the discovery, francium was referred to as eka-caesium, and astatine as eka-iodine. Sometimes, eka- is still used to refer to some of the transuranic elements, for example, eka-radium for unbinilium. But current official IUPAC practice is to use a systematic element name based on the atomic number of the element as the provisional name, instead of being based on its position in the periodic table as these prefixes require.\n\n\n== Original predictions ==\n \nThe four predicted elements lighter than the rare-earth elements, eka-boron (Eb, under boron, B, 5), eka-aluminium (Ea or El, under Al, 13), eka-manganese (Em, under Mn, 25), and eka-silicon (Es, under Si, 14), proved to be good predictors of the properties of scandium (Sc, 21), gallium (Ga, 31), technetium (Tc, 43), and germanium (Ge, 32) respectively, each of which fill the spot in the periodic table assigned by Mendeleev.\nThe names were written by Dmitri Mendeleev as экаборъ (ekaborʺ), экаалюминій (ekaaljuminij), экамарганецъ (ekamarganecʺ), and экасилицій (ekasilicij) respectively, following the pre-1917 Russian orthography.\nInitial versions of the periodic table did not distinguish rare earth elements from transition elements, helping to explain both why Mendeleev's predictions for heavier unknown elements did not fare as well as those for the lighter ones and why they are not as well known or documented.\nScandium oxide was isolated in late 1879 by Lars Fredrick Nilson; Per Teodor Cleve recognized the correspondence and notified Mendeleev late in that year. Mendeleev had predicted an atomic mass of 44 for eka-boron in 1871, while scandium has an atomic mass of 44.955908.\nIn 1871, Mendeleev predicted the existence of a yet-undiscovered element he named eka-aluminium (because of its proximity to aluminium in the periodic table). The table below compares the qualities of the element predicted by Mendeleev with actual characteristics of gallium, which was discovered, soon after Mendeleev predicted its existence, in 1875 by Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran.\n\nTechnetium was isolated by Carlo Perrier and Emilio Segrè in 1937, well after Mendeleev's lifetime, from samples of molybdenum that had been bombarded with deuterium nuclei in a cyclotron by Ernest Lawrence.  Mendeleev had predicted an atomic mass of 100 for eka-manganese in 1871, and the most stable isotope of technetium is 98Tc.\nGermanium was isolated in 1886 and provided the best confirmation of the theory up to that time, due to its contrasting more clearly with its neighboring elements than the two previously confirmed predictions of Mendeleev do with theirs.\n\n\n== Other predictions ==\nThe existence of an element between thorium (90) and uranium (92) was predicted by Mendeleev in 1871. In 1900, William Crookes isolated protactinium (91) as a radioactive material deriving from uranium that he could not identify. Different isotopes of protactinium were identified in Germany in 1913 and in 1918, but the n\nIn atomic physics and quantum chemistry, the electron configuration is the distribution of electrons of an atom or molecule (or other physical structure) in atomic or molecular orbitals. For example, the electron configuration of the neon atom is 1s2 2s2 2p6, meaning that the 1s, 2s, and 2p subshells are occupied by two, two, and six electrons, respectively.\nElectronic configurations describe each electron as moving independently in an orbital, in an average field created by the nuclei and all the other electrons. Mathematically, configurations are described by Slater determinants or configuration state functions.\nAccording to the laws of quantum mechanics, a level of energy is associated with each electron configuration. In certain conditions, electrons are able to move from one configuration to another by the emission or absorption of a quantum of energy, in the form of a photon.\nKnowledge of the electron configuration of different atoms is useful in understanding the structure of the periodic table of elements, for describing the chemical bonds that hold atoms together, and in understanding the chemical formulas of compounds and the geometries of molecules. In bulk materials, this same idea helps explain the peculiar properties of lasers and semiconductors.\n\n\n== Shells and subshells ==\n\nElectron configuration was first conceived under the Bohr model of the atom, and it is still common to speak of shells and subshells despite the advances in understanding of the quantum-mechanical nature of electrons.\nAn electron shell is the set of allowed states that share the same principal quantum number, n, that electrons may occupy. In each term of an electron configuration, n is the positive integer that precedes each orbital letter (helium's electron configuration is 1s2, therefore n = 1, and the orbital contains two electrons). An atom's nth electron shell can accommodate 2n2 electrons. For example, the first shell can accommodate two electrons, the second shell eight electrons, the third shell eighteen, and so on. The factor of two arises because the number of allowed states doubles with each successive shell due to electron spin—each atomic orbital admits up to two otherwise identical electrons with opposite spin, one with a spin +1⁄2 (usually denoted by an up-arrow) and one with a spin of −1⁄2 (with a down-arrow).\nA subshell is the set of states defined by a common azimuthal quantum number, l, within a shell. The value of l is in the range from 0 to n − 1. The values l = 0, 1, 2, 3 correspond to the s, p, d, and f labels, respectively. For example, the 3d subshell has n = 3 and l = 2. The maximum number of electrons that can be placed in a subshell is given by 2(2l + 1). This gives two electrons in an s subshell, six electrons in a p subshell, ten electrons in a d subshell and fourteen electrons in an f subshell.\nThe numbers of electrons that can occupy each shell and each subshell arise from the equations of quantum mechanics, in particular the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two electrons in the same atom can have the same values of the four quantum numbers.\n\n\n== Notation ==\n\nPhysicists and chemists use a standard notation to indicate the electron configurations of atoms and molecules. For atoms, the notation consists of a sequence of atomic subshell labels (e.g. for phosphorus the sequence 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p) with the number of electrons assigned to each subshell placed as a superscript. For example, hydrogen has one electron in the s-orbital of the first shell, so its configuration is written 1s1. Lithium has two electrons in the 1s-subshell and one in the (higher-energy) 2s-subshell, so its configuration is written 1s2 2s1 (pronounced \"one-s-two, two-s-one\"). Phosphorus (atomic number 15) is as follows: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p3.\nFor atoms with many electrons, this notation can become lengthy and so an abbreviated notation is used.

The most common name, post-transition metals, is generally used in this article.\nPhysically, these metals are soft (or brittle), have poor mechanical strength, and usually have melting points lower than those of the transition metals. Being close to the metal-nonmetal border, their crystalline structures tend to show covalent or directional bonding effects, having generally greater complexity or fewer nearest neighbours than other metallic elements.\nChemically, they are characterised—to varying degrees—by covalent bonding tendencies, acid-base amphoterism and the formation of anionic species such as aluminates, stannates, and bismuthates (in the case of aluminium, tin, and bismuth, respectively). They can also form Zintl phases (half-metallic compounds formed between highly electropositive metals and moderately electronegative metals or metalloids).\n\n\n== Applicable elements ==\n\nThe post-transition metals are located on the periodic table between the transition metals to their left and the chemically weak nonmetallic metalloids or nonmetals to their right. Generally included in this category are: the group 13–16 metals in periods 4–6 namely gallium, indium and thallium, tin and lead, bismuth, and polonium; and aluminium, a group 13 metal in period 3.\nThey can be seen at the bottom right in the accompanying plot of electronegativity values and melting points.\nThe boundaries of the category are not necessarily sharp as there is some overlapping of properties with adjacent categories (as occurs with classification schemes generally).\nSome elements otherwise counted as transition metals are sometimes instead counted as post-transition metals namely the group 10 metal platinum; the group 11 coinage metals copper, silver and gold; and, more often, the group 12 metals zinc, cadmium and mercury.\nSimilarly, some elements otherwise counted as metalloids or nonmetals are sometimes instead counted as post-transition metals namely germanium, arsenic, selenium, antimony, tellurium, and polonium (of which germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium are usually considered to be metalloids). Astatine, which is usually classified as a nonmetal or a metalloid, has been predicted to have a metallic crystalline structure. If so, it would be a post-transition metal.\nElements 112–118 (copernicium, nihonium, flerovium, moscovium, livermorium, tennessine, and oganesson) may be post-transition metals; insufficient quantities of them have been synthesized to allow sufficient investigation of their actual physical and chemical properties.\n\n\n== Rationale ==\nThe diminished metallic nature of the post-transition metals is largely attributable to the increase in nuclear charge going across the periodic table, from left to right.  The increase in nuclear charge is partially offset by an increasing number of electrons but as these are spatially distributed each extra electron does not fully screen each successive increase in nuclear charge, and the latter therefore dominates. With some irregularities, atomic radii contract, ionisation energies increase, fewer electrons become available for metallic bonding, and \"ions [become] smaller and more polarizing and more prone to covalency.\" This phenomenon is more evident in period 4–6 post-transition metals, due to inefficient screening of their nuclear charges by their d10 and (in the case of the period 6 metals) f14 electron configurations; the screening power of electrons decreases in the sequence s > p > d > f. The reductions in atomic size due to the interjection of the d- and f-blocks are referred to as, respectively, the 'scandide' or 'd-block contraction', and the 'lanthanide contraction'. Relativistic effects a\nIn atomic physics and quantum chemistry, the Aufbau principle (, from German: Aufbauprinzip, lit. 'building-up principle'), also called the Aufbau rule, states that in the ground state of an atom or ion, electrons first fill subshells of the lowest available energy, then fill subshells of higher energy. For example, the 1s subshell is filled before the 2s subshell is occupied. In this way, the electrons of an atom or ion form the most stable electron configuration possible. An example is the configuration 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p3 for the phosphorus atom, meaning that the 1s subshell has 2 electrons, the 2s subshell has 2 electrons, the 2p subshell has 6 electrons, and so on.\nThe configuration is often abbreviated by writing only the valence electrons explicitly, while the core electrons are replaced by the symbol for the last previous noble gas in the periodic table, placed in square brackets. For phosphorus, the last previous noble gas is neon, so the configuration is abbreviated to [Ne] 3s2 3p3, where [Ne] signifies the core electrons whose configuration in phosphorus is identical to that of neon.\nElectron behavior is elaborated by other principles of atomic physics, such as Hund's rule and the Pauli exclusion principle. Hund's rule asserts that if multiple orbitals of the same energy are available, electrons will occupy different orbitals singly and with the same spin before any are occupied doubly. If double occupation does occur, the Pauli exclusion principle requires that electrons that occupy the same orbital must have different spins (+1⁄2 and −1⁄2).\nPassing from one element to another of the next higher atomic number, one proton and one electron are added each time to the neutral atom.\nThe maximum number of electrons in any shell is 2n2, where n is the principal quantum number.\nThe maximum number of electrons in a subshell is equal to 2(2l + 1), where the azimuthal quantum number l is equal to 0, 1, 2, and 3 for s, p, d, and f subshells, so that the maximum numbers of electrons are 2, 6, 10, and 14 respectively. In the ground state, the electronic configuration can be built up by placing electrons in the lowest available subshell until the total number of electrons added is equal to the atomic number. Thus subshells are filled in the order of increasing energy, using two general rules to help predict electronic configurations:\n\nElectrons are assigned to subshells in order of increasing value of n + l.\nFor subshells with the same value of n + l, electrons are assigned first to the subshell with lower n.\nA version of the aufbau principle known as the nuclear shell model is used to predict the configuration of protons and neutrons in an atomic nucleus.\n\n\n== Madelung energy ordering rule ==\n\nIn neutral atoms, the approximate order in which subshells are filled is given by the n + l rule, also known as the:\n\nMadelung rule (after Erwin Madelung)\nJanet rule (after Charles Janet)\nKlechkowsky rule (after Vsevolod Klechkovsky)\nWiswesser's rule (after William Wiswesser)\naufbau (building-up) rule or\ndiagonal rule\nHere n represents the principal quantum number and l the azimuthal quantum number; the values l = 0, 1, 2, 3 correspond to the s, p, d, and f subshells, respectively. Subshells with a lower n + l value are filled before those with higher n + l values. In the many cases of equal n + l values, the subshell with a lower n value is filled first.  The subshell ordering by this rule is 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d, 7p, 8s, 5g, ... For example, thallium (Z = 81) has the ground-state configuration 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d10 4p6 5s2 4d10 5p6 6s2 4f14 5d10 6p1 or in condensed form, [Xe] 6s2 4f14 5d10 6p1.\nOther authors write the subshells outside of the noble gas core in order of increasing n, or if equal, increasing n + l, such as Tl (Z = 81) [Xe]4f14 5d10 6s2 6p1. They do so to emphasize that if this atom is ionized, electrons leave approximately in the order 6p, 6s, 5d, 4f, etc. On a relat\nThis page shows the electron configurations of the neutral gaseous atoms in their ground states. For each atom the subshells are given first in concise form, then with all subshells written out, followed by the number of electrons per shell. For phosphorus (element 15) as an example, the concise form is [Ne] 3s2 3p3. Here [Ne] refers to the core electrons which are the same as for the element neon (Ne), the last noble gas before phosphorus in the periodic table. The valence electrons (here 3s2 3p3) are written explicitly for all atoms.\nElectron configurations of elements beyond hassium (element 108) have never been measured; predictions are used below.\nAs an approximate rule, electron configurations are given by the Aufbau principle and the Madelung rule. However there are numerous exceptions; for example the lightest exception is chromium, which would be predicted to have the configuration 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d4 4s2, written as [Ar] 3d4 4s2, but whose actual configuration given in the table below is [Ar] 3d5 4s1.\nNote that these electron configurations are given for neutral atoms in the gas phase, which are not the same as the electron configurations for the same atoms in chemical environments. In many cases, multiple configurations are within a small range of energies and the irregularities shown below do not necessarily have a clear relation to chemical behaviour. For the undiscovered eighth-row elements, mixing of configurations is expected to be very important, and sometimes the result can no longer be well-described by a single configuration.\n\n\n== See also ==\nExtended periodic table#Electron configurations – Predictions for undiscovered elements 119–173 and 184\n\n\n== References ==\n\nAll sources concur with the data above except in the instances listed separately:\n\n\n=== NIST ===\nhttp://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/IonEnergy/ionEnergy.html ; retrieved July 2005, (elements 1–104) based on:\nAtomic Spectroscopy, by W.C.

He is best known for formulating the Periodic Law and creating a version of the periodic table of elements. He used the Periodic Law not only to correct the then-accepted properties of some known elements, such as the valence and atomic weight of uranium, but also to predict the properties of three elements that were yet to be discovered (germanium, gallium and scandium).\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nMendeleev was born in the village of Verkhnie Aremzyani, near Tobolsk in Siberia, to Ivan Pavlovich Mendeleev (1783–1847) and Maria Dmitrievna Mendeleeva (née Kornilieva) (1793–1850). Ivan worked as a school principal and a teacher of fine arts, politics and philosophy at the Tambov and Saratov gymnasiums. Ivan's father, Pavel Maximovich Sokolov, was a Russian Orthodox priest from the Tver region. As per the tradition of priests of that time, Pavel's children were given new family names while attending the theological seminary, with Ivan getting the family name Mendeleev after the name of a local landlord.\nMaria Kornilieva came from a well-known family of Tobolsk merchants, founders of the first Siberian printing house who traced their ancestry to Yakov Korniliev, a 17th-century posad man turned a wealthy merchant. In 1889, a local librarian published an article in the Tobolsk newspaper where he claimed that Yakov was a baptized Teleut, an ethnic minority known as \"white Kalmyks\" at the time. Since no sources were provided and no documented facts of Yakov's life were ever revealed, biographers generally dismiss it as a myth. In 1908, shortly after Mendeleev's death, one of his nieces published Family Chronicles. Memories about D. I. Mendeleev where she voiced \"a family legend\" about Maria's grandfather who married \"a Kyrgyz or Tatar beauty whom he loved so much that when she died, he also died from grief\". This, however, contradicts the documented family chronicles, and neither of those legends is supported by Mendeleev's autobiography, his daughter's or his wife's memoirs. Yet some Western scholars still refer to Mendeleev's supposed \"Mongol\", \"Tatar\", \"Tartarian\" or simply \"Asian\" ancestry as a fact.\nMendeleev was raised as an Orthodox Christian, his mother encouraging him to \"patiently search divine and scientific truth\". His son Ivan would later inform that Mendeleev had departed from the Church and embraced a form of \"romanticized deism\".\nMendeleev was the youngest of 17 siblings, of whom \"only 14 stayed alive to be baptized\" according to Mendeleev's brother Pavel, meaning the others died soon after their birth. The exact number of Mendeleev's siblings differs among sources and is still a matter of some historical dispute. Unfortunately for the family's financial well-being, his father became blind and lost his teaching position. His mother was forced to work and she restarted her family's abandoned glass factory. At the age of 13, after the passing of his father and the destruction of his mother's factory by fire, Mendeleev attended the Gymnasium in Tobolsk.\nIn 1849, his mother took Mendeleev across Russia from Siberia to Moscow with the aim of getting Mendeleev enrolled at the Moscow University. The university in Moscow did not accept him. The mother and son continued to Saint Petersburg to the father's alma mater. The now poor Mendeleev family relocated to Saint Petersburg, where he entered the Main Pedagogical Institute in 1850. After graduation, he contracted tuberculosis, causing him to move to the Crimean Peninsula on the northern coast of the Black Sea in 1855. While there, he became a science master of the 1st Simferopol Gymnasium. In 1857, he returned to Saint Petersburg with fully r\nAtomic theory is the scientific theory that matter is composed of particles called atoms. The definition of the word \"atom\" has changed over the years in response to scientific discoveries. Initially, it referred to a hypothetical concept of there being some fundamental particle of matter, too small to be seen by the naked eye, that could not be divided. Then the definition was refined to being the basic particles of the chemical elements, when chemists observed that elements seemed to combine with each other in ratios of small whole numbers. Then physicists discovered that these particles had an internal structure of their own and therefore perhaps did not deserve to be called \"atoms\", but renaming atoms would have been impractical by that point.\nAtomic theory is one of the most important scientific developments in history, crucial to all the physical sciences. At the start of The Feynman Lectures on Physics, physicist and Nobel laureate Richard Feynman offers the atomic hypothesis as the single most prolific scientific concept.\n\n\n== Philosophical atomism ==\n\nThe basic idea that matter is made up of tiny indivisible particles is an old idea that appeared in many ancient cultures. The word atom is derived from the ancient Greek word atomos, which means \"uncuttable\". This ancient idea was based in philosophical reasoning rather than scientific reasoning. Modern atomic theory is not based on these old concepts. In the early 19th century, the scientist John Dalton noticed that chemical substances seemed to combine with each other by discrete and consistent units of weight, and he decided to use the word atom to refer to these units.\n\n\n== Groundwork ==\nWorking in the late 15th century, Robert Boyle developed the concept of a chemical element as substance different from a compound.: 293 \nNear the end of the 18th century, a number of important developments in chemistry emerged without referring to the notion of an atomic theory. The first was Antoine Lavoisier who showed that compounds consist of elements in constant proportion, redefining an element as a substance which scientists could not decompose into simpler substances by experimentation. This brought an end to the ancient idea of the elements of matter being fire, earth, air, and water, which had no experimental support. Lavoisier showed that water can be decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen, which in turn he could not decompose into anything simpler, thereby proving these are elements. Lavoisier also defined the law of conservation of mass, which states that in a chemical reaction, matter does not appear nor disappear into thin air; the total mass remains the same even if the substances involved were transformed.: 293  Finally, there was the law of definite proportions, established by the French chemist Joseph Proust in 1797, which states that if a compound is broken down into its constituent chemical elements, then the masses of those constituents will always have the same proportions by weight, regardless of the quantity or source of the original compound. This definition distinguished compounds from mixtures.\n\n\n== Dalton's law of multiple proportions ==\n\nJohn Dalton studied data gathered by himself and by other scientists. He noticed a pattern that later came to be known as the law of multiple proportions: in compounds which contain two particular elements, the amount of Element A per measure of Element B will differ across these compounds by ratios of small whole numbers. This suggested that each element combines with other elements in multiples of a basic quantity.\nIn 1804, Dalton explained his atomic theory to his friend and fellow chemist Thomas Thomson, who published an explanation of Dalton's theory in his book A System of Chemistry in 1807. According to Thomson, Dalton's idea first occurred to him when experimenting with \"olefiant gas\" (ethylene) and \"carburetted hydrogen gas\" (methane). Dalton found that \"carburetted hydrogen gas\" contains twice as much hydrogen pe\nThe periodic table of mathematical shapes is popular name given to a project to classify Fano varieties. The project was thought up by Professor Alessio Corti, from the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London. It aims to categorise all three-, four- and five-dimensional shapes into a single table, analogous to the periodic table of chemical elements. It is meant to hold the equations that describe each shape and, through this, mathematicians and other scientists expect to develop a better understanding of the shapes’ geometric properties and relations. \nThe project has already won the Philip Leverhulme Prize—worth £70,000—from the Leverhulme Trust, and in 2019 a European Research Council grant.\nWhile it is estimated that 500 million shapes can be defined algebraically in four dimensions, they may be decomposable (in the sense of the minimal model program) into as few as a few thousand \"building blocks\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of complex and algebraic surfaces\nList of surfaces\nLists of shapes\nList of mathematical shapes\nList of two-dimensional geometric shapes\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFano Varieties and Extremal Laurent Polynomials A collaborative research blog for the project.\n'Periodic Table of Shapes' to Give a New Dimension to Math\nAtoms ripple in the periodic table of shapes\nNature's building blocks brought to life\nDatabases of quantum periods for Fano manifolds by Tom Coates and Alexander M.

The periodic law was recognized as a fundamental discovery in the late 19th century. It was explained early in the 20th century, with the discovery of atomic numbers and associated pioneering work in quantum mechanics, both ideas serving to illuminate the internal structure of the atom. A recognisably modern form of the table was reached in 1945 with Glenn T. Seaborg's discovery that the actinides were in fact f-block rather than d-block elements. The periodic table and law are now a central and indispensable part of modern chemistry."

Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, phosphorus, mercury, zinc and sulfur, which formed the basis for the modern list of elements. Lavoisier's list also included \"light\" and \"caloric\", which at the time were believed to be material substances. He classified these substances into metals and nonmetals. While many leading chemists refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the Elementary Treatise was written well enough to convince the younger"

It is colorless, odorless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. Constituting about 75% of all normal matter, hydrogen is the most abundant chemical element in the universe. Stars, including the Sun, mainly consist of hydrogen in a plasma state, while on Earth, hydrogen is found in water, organic compounds, as dihydrogen, and in other molecular forms.

Its role is crucial in acid-base reactions, which mainly involve proton exchange among soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of either a negatively charged anion, where it is known as hydride, or as a positively charged cation, H+.

Its main industrial uses include fossil fuel processing, such as hydrocracking, and ammonia production, with emerging uses in fuel cells for electricity generation and as a heat source.

For atoms, the notation consists of a sequence of atomic subshell labels (e.g. for phosphorus the sequence 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p) with the number of electrons assigned to each subshell placed as a superscript. For example, hydrogen has one electron in the s-orbital of the first shell, so its configuration is written 1s1. Lithium has two electrons in the 1s-subshell and one in the (higher-energy) 2s-subshell, so its configuration is written 1s2 2s1 (pronounced \"one-s-two, two-s-one\"). Phosphorus (atomic number 15) is as follows: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p3.\nFor atoms with many electrons, this notation can become lengthy and so an abbreviated notation is used.

With some irregularities, atomic radii contract, ionisation energies increase, fewer electrons become available for metallic bonding, and \"ions [become] smaller and more polarizing and more prone to covalency.\" This phenomenon is more evident in period 4–6 post-transition metals, due to inefficient screening of their nuclear charges by their d10 and (in the case of the period 6 metals) f14 electron configurations; the screening power of electrons decreases in the sequence s > p > d > f.

                "content": "Near the end of the 18th century, a number of important developments in chemistry emerged without referring to the notion of an atomic theory. The first was Antoine Lavoisier who showed that compounds consist of elements in constant proportion, redefining an element as a substance which scientists could not decompose into simpler substances by experimentation. This brought an end to the ancient idea of the elements of matter being fire, earth, air, and water, which had no experimental support. Lavoisier showed that water can be decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen, which in turn he could not decompose into anything simpler, thereby proving these are elements. Lavoisier also defined the law of conservation of mass, which states that in a chemical reaction, matter does not appear nor disappear into thin air; the total mass remains the same even if the substances involved were transformed.: 293  Finally, there was the law of definite proportions, established by the French chemist Joseph"

This definition distinguished compounds from mixtures."

He noticed a pattern that later came to be known as the law of multiple proportions: in compounds which contain two particular elements, the amount of Element A per measure of Element B will differ across these compounds by ratios of small whole numbers. This suggested that each element combines with other elements in multiples of a basic quantity.\nIn 1804, Dalton explained his atomic theory to his friend and fellow chemist Thomas Thomson, who published an explanation of Dalton's theory in his book A System of Chemistry in 1807. According to Thomson, Dalton's idea first occurred to him when experimenting with \"olefiant gas\" (ethylene) and \"carburetted hydrogen gas\" (methane). Dalton found that \"carburetted hydrogen gas\" contains twice as much hydrogen pe"

The project was thought up by Professor Alessio Corti, from the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London. It aims to categorise all three-, four- and five-dimensional shapes into a single table, analogous to the periodic table of chemical elements. It is meant to hold the equations that describe each shape and, through this, mathematicians and other scientists expect to develop a better understanding of the shapes’ geometric properties and relations. \nThe project has already won the Philip Leverhulme Prize—worth £70,000—from the Leverhulme Trust, and in 2019 a European Research Council grant.\nWhile it is estimated that 500 million shapes can be defined algebraically in four dimensions, they may be decomposable (in the sense of the minimal model program) into as few as a few thousand \"building blocks\"."
