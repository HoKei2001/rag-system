While making an attempt, he is summoned by a novice for an emergency, that of an overweight woman possessed by a demon. Father Maurice performs the rite of exorcism, expelling the demon from the woman.\nThe demon, an escaped little devil named Giuditta, not wanting to return whence he came, starts following Father Maurice everywhere and often indulges in mischief, sometimes innocently getting Father Maurice into trouble. Father Maurice fails several times to get rid of Giuditta, who, in one instance, replaces an ill Father Maurice at Mass, turning the solemn ceremony into a fashion parade. Seeing that he is showing signs of exhaustion, Father Maurice's peers advise him to take a vacation. Eventually, another agent \"from the same place as Giuditta\" appears and manages to attract Giuditta, who finally leaves Maurice and follows her \"elsewhere\".\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRoberto Benigni as Giuditta, the little devil\nWalter Matthau as Father Maurice\nNicoletta Braschi as Nina\nStefania Sandrelli as Patrizia\nJohn Lurie as Cusatelli\nPaolo Baroni as Saverio\nFranco Fabrizi as Priest\nAnnabella Schiavone as Giuditta, the woman\n\n\n== Awards ==\nRoberto Benigni won the David di Donatello Award for Best Actor.\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Little Devil at IMDb\nThe Little Devil at Rotten Tomatoes\nThe Little Devil at AllMovie\nThe Little Devil at Variety Distribution\nLittle Devil Inside is an upcoming action-adventure video game developed and published by Neostream Interactive. The game's single-player and co-operative multiplayer modes both follow the professional and personal lives of explorers searching for monsters & supernatural events in a 19th-century-inspired world. It is planned for initial release on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, with Nintendo Switch and Xbox One versions to come later.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nLittle Devil Inside is a third-person 3D action-adventure role-playing video game with elements of survival, combat, and open-world exploration; however, its developers, Neostream Interactive, have described the game's survival elements as \"rather easy\" compared to other games in the survival genre, stating that the game is \"not about how long you can survive in a certain environment\", instead being about \"taking a trip for a mission, and surviving during the process.\" Examples of in-game survival elements include harvesting water from cacti, chopping wood to make a fire, and cooking food obtained from hunting. Players can use a variety of weapons and tools to survive and accomplish their objectives, such as a sword, shield, gun, grappling hook, bombs, tent, and cooking equipment.\nThe game takes places across multiple locations with differing environmental conditions, including desert, snow, forest, mountains, swampland, and deep-sea diving. These areas are connected by a \"world map\", which uses tilt-shift effects to create the appearance of miniature scale. Although this overall map is available, players cannot \"fast forward\" their travel to these locations; instead, they must take direct control of their transportation during the journey and respond to events that occur on the way, such as encounters with NPCs, overcoming obstacles (such as a flock of sheep), or being ambushed by enemies. Players also have the ability to upgrade their transportation (alongside their weapons and armor) as the game progresses.\nBetween missions, players can return to the safety of the game's home town to rest and prepare for further adventures (such as talking with NPCs, gathering information on the next location through library research, and preparing for its weather conditions).\nThe game also includes roguelike gameplay elements: In the event of a player's character dying, that character cannot be resurrected; however, the player can take subsequent characters to that same location in order to recover any lost equipment.\nThe game also supports co-operative multiplayer (including local multiplayer), where more than one player participates in the same mission. Additionally, the game features the possibility of random encounters between players.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nLittle Devil Inside takes place in a 19th-century, Victorian-inspired setting, with elements of steampunk. The developers describe it as a \"surreal, unrealistic world ... somewhere between heaven and hell.\" The main character, Billy, is a swordsman, employed by a research team (led by college professor Vincent and his colleague, Dr. Oliver) to travel the world in search of the supernatural and other unusual incidents. The ultimate objective set out by the researchers is to assemble a complete encyclopaedia of \"all phenomenal existence.\"\nThe game also takes a satirical angle on the video game clich√© of hunting monsters for financial reward by also exploring the more mundane aspects of such characters' lives and their financial inequality with their employers.\n\n\n== Development and release ==\nLittle Devil Inside was originally conceived by its creative director, Kody Lee, and was developed as the first game by Seoul's Neostream Interactive, who initially began in 1998 as a multimedia design & production company. Development began originally using the Unity Engine, then later switched to the Unreal Engine by Epic Games. The game was first announced through a Kickstarter campaign in April 2015, alongside a pre-alpha trailer and \nThe Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) (palawa kani: purinina) is a carnivorous marsupial of the family Dasyuridae. It was formerly present across mainland Australia, but became extinct there around 3,500 years ago; it is now confined to the island of Tasmania. The size of a small dog, the Tasmanian devil became the largest carnivorous marsupial in the world following the extinction of the thylacine in 1936. It is related to quolls, and distantly related to the thylacine. It is characterised by its stocky and muscular build, black fur, pungent odour, extremely loud and disturbing screech, keen sense of smell, and ferocity when feeding. The Tasmanian devil's large head and neck allow it to generate among the strongest bites per unit body mass of any extant predatory land mammal. It hunts prey and scavenges on carrion.\nAlthough devils are usually solitary, they sometimes eat and defecate together in a communal location. Unlike most other dasyurids, the devil thermoregulates effectively, and is active during the middle of the day without overheating. Despite its rotund appearance, it is capable of surprising speed and endurance, and can climb trees and swim across rivers. Devils are not monogamous. Males fight one another for females, and guard their partners to prevent female infidelity. Females can ovulate three times in as many weeks during the mating season, and 80% of two-year-old females are seen to be pregnant during the annual mating season.\nFemales average four breeding seasons in their life, and give birth to 20 to 30 live young after three weeks' gestation. The newborn are pink, lack fur, have indistinct facial features, and weigh around 0.20 g (0.0071 oz) at birth. As there are only four nipples in the pouch, competition is fierce, and few newborns survive. The young grow rapidly, and are ejected from the pouch after around 100 days, weighing roughly 200 g (7.1 oz). The young become independent after around nine months.\nIn 1941, devils became officially protected. Since the late 1990s, the devil facial tumour disease (DFTD) has drastically reduced the population and now threatens the survival of the species, which in 2008 was declared to be endangered. Starting in 2013, Tasmanian devils are again being sent to zoos around the world as part of the Australian government's Save the Tasmanian Devil Program. The devil is an iconic symbol of Tasmania and many organisations, groups and products associated with the state use the animal in their logos. It is seen as an important attractor of tourists to Tasmania and has come to worldwide attention through the Looney Tunes character of the same name.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nBelieving it to be a type of opossum, naturalist George Harris wrote the first published description of the Tasmanian devil in 1807, naming it Didelphis ursina, due to its bearlike characteristics such as the round ear. He had earlier made a presentation on the topic at the Zoological Society of London. However, that particular binomial name had been given to the common wombat (later reclassified as Vombatus ursinus) by George Shaw in 1800, and was hence unavailable. In 1838, a specimen was named Dasyurus laniarius by Richard Owen, but by 1877 he had relegated it to Sarcophilus. The modern Tasmanian devil was named Sarcophilus harrisii (\"Harris's flesh-lover\") by French naturalist Pierre Boitard in 1841.\nA later revision of the devil's taxonomy, published in 1987, attempted to change the species name to Sarcophilus laniarius based on mainland fossil records of only a few animals. However, this was not accepted by the taxonomic community at large; the name S. harrisii has been retained and S. laniarius relegated to a fossil species. \"Beelzebub's pup\" was an early vernacular name given to it by the explorers of Tasmania, in reference to a religious figure who is a prince of hell and an assistant of Satan; the explorers first encountered the animal by hearing its far-reaching vocalisations at night.

It is one of a number of Hollywood films dealing with the exploits of the Flying Tigers that began with the Republic Pictures production Flying Tigers (1942).\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter being shot down, \"Big Butch\" Dooley (Paul Kelly), a Flying Tigers pilot lands his Curtiss P-40 Warhawk in the ruins of a Chinese village. After he rescues a wounded boy, orphaned by the war, Dooley takes him back to his unit.\nThe young orphan is adopted by the Flying Tigers, and is called \"Little Butch\" Dooley. Big Butch and the other Tigers realize that the boy needs a proper education and send him to the Temple Missionary School run by \"Doc\" Temple (Harry Carey).\nLittle Butch organizes the other refugee children and trains them in fighting the invading Japanese. Leading the children, dubbed \"Little Devils,\" in nightly raids, Little Dutch takes over a store of gasoline, but he is wounded during the battle.\nTwo of the two of the Little Devils are taken prisoner while blowing up a Japanese supply base. When Doc pleads with a Japanese officer for their release, he learns about the attack on Pearl Harbor and realizes he will be taken prisoner. Little Butch rescues Doc, and soon after, the Japanese bomb the mission.\nLater, an American aircraft crashes, and the Little Devils race with the Japanese to reach the wreck. The Little Devils find the aircraft first and are surprised to discover that the pilot is Big Butch. After treating Big Butch's wounds, the Little Devils help him cross a river and return safely to the Chinese lines.\nAs the young boys are escaping, however, a Japanese patrol converges on them. They sacrifice their lives while shooting it out with the enemy, and sometime later, the spirit of Little Butch rides with Big Butch, as he drops bombs on Tokyo.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nMonogram Pictures had a history of B movie productions and China's Little Devils  fits that scenario. The film utilized sequences from Flying Tigers (1942) as well, as the Curtiss P-40 mockups used in the earlier film.\nPrincipal photography on  China's Little Devils took place from June 30 until early August, 1944. Most of the filming took place on studio backlots.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nFilm historian Leonard Maltin described China's Little Devils as a \"Patriotic WW2 yarn involving Chinese waifs who battle Japanese invaders and come to the aid of downed American pilots.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nChina's Little Devils at the TCM Movie Database\nChina's Little Devils at IMDb\nThe Devil All the Time is the debut novel by American writer Donald Ray Pollock, published in 2011 by Doubleday. Its plot follows desperate characters in post-World War II Southern Ohio and West Virginia, including a disturbed war veteran, a husband and wife who are serial killers, and an abusive preacher. A film adaptation of the same name directed by Antonio Campos and narrated by Pollock, starred Tom Holland, Sebastian Stan, Robert Pattinson and Bill Skarsg√•rd, and was produced by Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe Devil All the Time follows the events and fates of various characters who all carry their own secrets from the past. As the novel progresses the lives of these people converge in unexpected ways.\nIn a prologue, Pollock introduces the protagonist, Arvin, as a young boy. He sits in a clearing with his father, Willard, on an oak log, joining him in his evening prayer routine. Willard is borderline obsessive when it comes to prayer and expects the same from his son. While Arvin prays, however, his mind wanders and feelings of isolation bubble to the surface. Feeling like an outsider at school, he is the victim of relentless bullying. Arvin recalls his father telling him to stand up for himself, but this is easier said than done.\nThe rest of the book is divided into seven parts. Part One, \"Sacrifice,\" begins in 1945, before the prologue. Willard is a young single man who has just been discharged from combat duty after the end of World War II. As he sits on a bus headed to his home in Coal Creek, West Virginia, he recalls the horrifying things he saw and did during the war. One memory haunts him in particular: that of a soldier he comes across who has been skinned and crucified. Willard shoots the man as an act of mercy, putting an end to his suffering. The bus makes a stop at the Wooden Spoon Diner in Meade, Ohio. There, Willard meets and instantly falls in love with a beautiful waitress, Charlotte Willoughby. At home, he is met by his nervous and emotionally-damaged mother, Emma, and her brother, Uncle Earskell. Willard proceeds to get drunk, and his thoughts turn from the horrors of war to the beautiful waitress he just met. He lets it slip to his mother that he has fallen in love, which upsets her because she made a bargain with God that if he let her son live, she would arrange a marriage between Willard and poor Helen Hatton.\nAt church one evening, we meet Brother Roy and Brother Theodore, Roy‚Äôs fat and crippled cousin. They preach about letting God cure you of your worst fears and Roy dumps a bin full of spiders on his head, scaring almost everyone in the chapel. Helen takes a liking to Roy and they later have a daughter named Lenora.\nFeeling his connection with God lessen, Roy decides that in order to regain his bond he must crucify something and raise it from the dead. Theodore, who hates Helen for taking Roy‚Äôs attention, convinces Roy to kill her for the sacrifice. They take her out to a field and Roy stabs her in the neck with a screwdriver. As expected, Roy is unable to raise her from the dead and they flee the town, leaving Lenora with Emma (Willard's mother).\nLinking back up with other characters, Willard marries Charlotte and together they have a son whom they name Arvin. As the years pass, Willard becomes obsessed with prayer. The obsession only deepens when Charlotte is diagnosed with cancer. Willard's rituals become progressively more bizarre and upsetting, culminating in animal and even human sacrifice. Willard believes these acts of devotion are necessary to save his wife. Nevertheless, in the end, Charlotte still dies, prompting Willard to commit suicide. Traumatized by his parents' deaths and his father's behavior, Arvin lives with his grandmother, Emma. There, he meets Lenora, an orphan girl whom Emma takes in after her mother, Helen, is killed, the prime suspects in everyone‚Äôs mind being the traveling preacher named Roy who is also Lenora's father.\nIn Part 2, \"On the Hunt,\" the reader is introduc\nDevils Tower (also known as Bear Lodge) is a butte, possibly laccolithic, composed of igneous rock in the Bear Lodge Ranger District of the Black Hills, near Hulett and Sundance in Crook County, northeastern Wyoming, above the Belle Fourche River. It rises 1,267 feet (386 m) above the Belle Fourche River, standing 867 feet (264 m) from summit to base. The summit is 5,112 feet (1,558 m) above sea level.\nDevils Tower National Monument was the first United States national monument, established on September 24, 1906, by President Theodore Roosevelt. The monument's boundary encloses an area of 1,347 acres (545 ha).\n\n\n== Name ==\nIndigenous names for the monolith include \"Bear's House\" or \"Bear's Lodge\" (or \"Bear's Tipi\", \"Home of the Bear\", \"Bear's Lair\"); Cheyenne, Lakota: Mat»ü√≥ Th√≠pila, Crow: Daxpitcheeaas√°ao (\"Home of Bears\"), \"Aloft on a Rock\" (Kiowa), \"Tree Rock\", \"Great Gray Horn\", and \"Brown Buffalo Horn\" (Lakota: Pteh√© «¶√≠).\nThe name \"Devil's Tower\" originated in 1875 during an expedition led by Colonel Richard Irving Dodge, when his interpreter reportedly misinterpreted a native name to mean \"Bad God's Tower\". All information signs in that area use the name \"Devils Tower\", following a geographic naming standard whereby the apostrophe is omitted.\nIn 2005, a proposal to recognize several indigenous ties through the additional designation of the monolith as Bear Lodge National Historic Landmark were opposed by United States Representative Barbara Cubin, arguing that a \"name change will harm the tourist trade and bring economic hardship to area communities\". In November 2014, Arvol Looking Horse proposed renaming the geographical feature \"Bear Lodge\" and submitted the request to the United States Board on Geographic Names. A second proposal was submitted to request that the U.S. acknowledge what it described as the \"offensive\" mistake in keeping the current name and to rename the monument and sacred site into Bear Lodge National Historic Landmark. The formal public comment period ended in fall 2015. Local state senator Ogden Driskill opposed the change. The name was not changed.\n\n\n== Geology ==\n\nThe landscape surrounding Devils Tower is composed mostly of sedimentary rocks. The oldest rocks visible in Devils Tower National Monument were laid down in a shallow sea during the Triassic. This dark red sandstone and maroon siltstone, interbedded with shale, can be seen along the Belle Fourche River. Oxidation of iron minerals causes the redness of the rocks. This rock layer is known as the Spearfish Formation. Above the Spearfish Formation is a thin band of white gypsum, called the Gypsum Springs Formation, Jurassic in age. Overlying this formation is the Sundance Formation. During the Paleocene Epoch, 56 to 66 million years ago, the Rocky Mountains and the Black Hills were uplifted. Magma rose through the crust, intruding into the existing sedimentary rock layers.\nGeologists Carpenter and Russell studied Devils Tower in the late 19th century and came to the conclusion that it was formed by an igneous intrusion. In 1907, geologists Nelson Horatio Darton and C.C. O'Harra (of the South Dakota School of Mines) theorized that Devils Tower must be an eroded remnant of a laccolith.\nThe igneous material that forms the Tower is a phonolite porphyry intruded about 40.5 million years ago, a light to dark-gray or greenish-gray igneous rock with conspicuous crystals of white feldspar. As the magma cooled, hexagonal columns formed (though sometimes 4-, 5-, and 7-sided columns were possible), up to 20 feet (6.1 m) wide and 600 feet (180 m) tall.\nAs rain and snow continue to erode the sedimentary rocks surrounding the Tower's base, more of Devils Tower will be exposed. Nonetheless, the exposed portions of the Tower still experience certain amounts of erosion. Cracks along the columns are subject to water and ice erosion. Portions, or even entire columns, of rock at Devils Tower are continually breaking off and falling. Piles of broken columns, boul\nThe following is a list of episodes for the television show Little House on the Prairie, an American Western drama about a family living on a farm in Walnut Grove, Minnesota from the 1870s to the 1890s. The show is a full-colour version of Laura Ingalls Wilder‚Äôs series of Little House books.\nThe regular series was preceded by the two-hour pilot movie, which first aired on March 30, 1974. The series began on the NBC network on September 11, 1974, and ended on May 10, 1982.

Imbued with a mischievous personality and able to produce fire, Hot Stuff appears as a red child devil who wears a diaper (said to be made of asbestos) and carries a magical sentient pitchfork (referred to as his \"trusty trident\"), which is a character in its own right. Much to the consternation of his demonic brethren, Hot Stuff sometimes performs good deeds to irritate them.\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nCreated and first drawn by Warren Kremer, Hot Stuff has appeared in at least eight comic book titles including:\n\nHot Stuff Sizzlers (1960)\nDevil Kids Starring Hot Stuff (1962)\nHot Stuff Creepy Caves (1974)\nThe character also appeared in multiple back-up stories between the periods 1957-1982 and 1986-1991, along with sporadic appearances in other publications during the 1990s and 2000s. The most recent appearance of Hot Stuff was in 2009 with Casper the Friendly Ghost and Wendy the Good Little Witch, when a three-issue comic book miniseries was published by Arden Entertainment called Casper and the Spectrals.\nWarren Kremer and Howard Post were the artists who helped define the look of Hot Stuff, drawing many comic book covers and stories over the years. Ernie Col√≥n was another major comics artist who drew Hot Stuff.\nWhile Harvey Comics flagship characters Casper the Friendly Ghost, Spooky and Wendy the Good Little Witch often crossed over into each other's stories, Hot Stuff rarely appeared with them. Instead, the little devil would be featured with characters like Stumbo the Giant (created by Warren Kremer and Larz Bourne, and appeared in back-up stories in Hot Stuff comics in 1957), Katnip the cat, Herman the mouse and good fairy Princess Charma. While they often tended to annoy or anger Hot Stuff, their appearances served to further develop Hot Stuff's character.\n\n\n== Comic book series ==\nHot Stuff the Little Devil\nDevil Kids Starring Hot Stuff\nHot Stuff Creepy Caves\nHot Stuff Sizzlers\nHot Stuff Digest \nHarvey Wiseguys\nAstro Comics\nCasper And...\nHot Stuff the Little Devil, Vol. 2\nCasper and his Friends Magazine (Marvel Comics)\nCasper and the Spectrals (Arden Entertainment)\nHot Stuff the Little Devil Halloween Special (Dark House Comics)\nHarvey Comics Treasury (Dark House comics)\nHarvey Hits (Joe Books)\nCasper the Friendly Ghost (American Mythology Productions)\n\n\n== Recurring characters ==\nAunt Clinker, Hot Stuff's aunt and primary guardian, who resembles a witch but is a devil.

The Devils compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Metropolitan Division in the Eastern Conference. The club was founded as the Kansas City Scouts in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1974. The Scouts moved to Denver in 1976 and became the Colorado Rockies. In 1982, they moved to East Rutherford, New Jersey, and took their current name, which is derived from the legendary Jersey Devil creature. For their first 25 seasons in New Jersey, the Devils were based at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford and played their home games at Brendan Byrne Arena (later renamed Continental Airlines Arena). Before the 2007‚Äì08 season, the team moved to Prudential Center in Newark. The Devils are owned and managed by Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment (HBSE), with founders Josh Harris and David Blitzer acquiring the team in 2013.\nThe franchise was poor to mediocre in the eight years before moving to New Jersey, a pattern that continued during the first five years in New Jersey as they failed to make the Stanley Cup playoffs and never finished higher than fifth in their division, which had six teams at the time. Their fortunes began to turn around following the hiring of the president and general manager Lou Lamoriello in 1987. Under Lamoriello's stewardship, the Devils made the playoffs all but three times between 1988 and 2012, including 13 berths in a row from 1997 to 2010, and finished with a winning record every season from 1992‚Äì93 to 2009‚Äì10. They have won the Atlantic Division regular season title nine times, most recently in 2009‚Äì10, before transferring to the newly created Metropolitan Division as part of the NHL's realignment in 2013. The Devils have reached the Stanley Cup Finals five times, winning in 1994‚Äì95, 1999‚Äì2000 and 2002‚Äì03, and losing in 2000‚Äì01 and 2011‚Äì12. The Devils were known for their defense-first approach throughout their years of Cup contention, and were one of the teams credited with popularizing the neutral zone trap in the mid-1990s.\nThe Devils have a rivalry with their cross-Hudson River neighbor, the New York Rangers, as well as a rivalry with the Philadelphia Flyers. The Devils are one of three NHL teams in the New York metropolitan area; the others are the Rangers and the New York Islanders. The Devils are one of four major professional sports teams that play their home games in New Jersey; the others are the National Football League's New York Giants and New York Jets, and the New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer. Since the relocation of the New Jersey Nets to Brooklyn in 2012, the Devils have been the only major league team in any sport to bill themselves as representing the state of New Jersey.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Kansas City and Colorado ===\n\nIn 1972, the NHL announced plans to add two expansion teams, including one in Kansas City, Missouri, owned by a group headed by Edwin G. Thompson. The new team was officially named the Scouts in reference to Cyrus E. Dallin's statue of the same name which stands in that city's Penn Valley Park. In the team's inaugural season, 1974‚Äì75, the Scouts were forced to wait until the ninth game to play in Kansas City's Kemper Arena, and did not post a win until beating the Washington Capitals, their expansion brethren, in their tenth contest. With 41 points in their inaugural season, the Scouts finished last in the Smythe Division; only the Capitals had fewer points in the NHL.

Helgesen and drummer Kristoffer Vold Austrheim under the name The Headless Children, a cover band of Slayer and Kreator. A year later singer Erik Borgen and guitarist Kenneth Bergsagel joined the group.\nThey changed the name to Carnal Tomb, then Borgen left the band and Helgesen became the singer/bassist with the female voice of Linn Achre Tveit (Keltziva). Elin Overskott joined the band as a keyboard player.\nThis was the first line-up of Dismal Euphony, officially formed in 1995. In the same year, the group composed the demo Spellbound. After this publication, they were signed by Napalm Records. Here they produced other albums like Soria Moria slott, Autumn Leaves: The Rebellion of Tides and the Lady Ablaze EP (which already features Anja Natasha as female singer).\nLater, Dismal Euphony joined Nuclear Blast and released All Little Devils, with the new female singer Anja Natasha.\nTheir last album is Python Zero.

It is named for its projected thumb-like appearance. Its name in the Tlingit language means \"the mountain that never flooded\" and is said to have been a refuge for people during Aangalakhu (\"the Great Flood\"). It is one of the peaks that marks the border between the United States and Canada, and is also listed on maps as Boundary Peak 71.\nDevils Thumb is a very challenging climb even for advanced mountain climbers.\n\n\n== Location ==\nDevils Thumb is part of a group of striking, difficult rock peaks on the western edge of the Stikine Icecap.  The Stikine Icecap occupies the crest of the Boundary Ranges, a subrange of the Coast Mountains spanning the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border, north of the mouth of the Stikine River.  Other peaks in the area include the Witches Tits and Cat's Ears Spires (part of the western ridge of the Devils Thumb massif itself), and Mount Burkett and Burkett Needle, a pair of spires about 8 mi (13 km) to the northeast.\n\n\n== Notable features ==\nThe most famous feature on the Devils Thumb among climbers is its Northwest Face, rising 6,700 ft (2,042 m) from the Witches Cauldron at its base to the summit, at an average angle of 67 degrees. This is the biggest rock face in North America.  The conditions prevalent also make it perhaps the most dangerous climbing proposition on the continent.\n\n\n== Climbing history ==\nThe first ascent of the Devils Thumb was a landmark in North American mountaineering. Fred Beckey, along with Clifford Schmidtke and Bob Craig, climbed the East Ridge, a route that combined technical difficulty equal to anything ever climbed on the continent to that time with great remoteness and terrible weather conditions. \nThe Northwest Face has seen many attempts; at least three teams have died on this face. It stands as a huge wall with bad weather, bad rock, bad ice, and bad avalanches. \"It is a dangerous and difficult face that rarely, if ever, comes into condition,\" says Dieter Klose, who in 1982 made it halfway up the route, higher than anybody else alive.\nIn 1977, author Jon Krakauer climbed the East Ridge of the Devils Thumb, a feat described in detail in his book Eiger Dreams: Ventures Among Men and Mountains. Krakauer also chronicles his solo ascent of Devils Thumb in chapters 14 and 15 of his book Into the Wild.\nIn 2024, Alex Honnold and Tommy Caldwell successfully scaled all 5 peaks in just under 12 hours, completing the first ever single day traverse of the Devil‚Äôs Thumb skyline.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlaska boundary dispute\n\n\n== Notes ==\n^  The peak's official name carries no apostrophe.\n^  A shoulder of the peak is the crash site of Dirk Benedict's character's plane in the 1996 film Alaska.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\"Devils Thumb\".

The monument protects Devils Postpile, an unusual rock formation of columnar basalt, \"all closely and perfectly fitted together like a vast mosaic.\" The monument encompasses 798 acres (323 ha) and includes two main attractions: the Devils Postpile formation and Rainbow Falls, a waterfall on the Middle Fork of the San Joaquin River. In addition, the John Muir Trail and Pacific Crest Trail merge into one trail as they pass through the monument. Excluding a small developed area containing the monument headquarters, visitor center and a campground, the National Monument lies within the borders of the Ansel Adams Wilderness.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe monument was established in 1911 as \"Devil Postpile National Monument,\" (no possessive) but is widely referred to as Devils Postpile National Monument, and has been officially styled as plural without the apostrophe since the 1930s.\nAn alternate historic name was Devil's Woodpile. According to Historic Spots in California (1966), \"In every scenic freak the sheep-herder recognizes the work of his Satanic majesty. This formation is therefore known to local fame as the Devil's Woodpile.\"\nThe monument was once part of Yosemite National Park, but discovery of gold in 1905 near Mammoth Lakes prompted a boundary change that left the Postpile on adjacent public land. Later, a proposal to build a hydroelectric dam called for blasting the Postpile into the river. Influential Californians, including John Muir, persuaded the federal government to stop the demolition and, in 1911, President William Howard Taft protected the area as a National Monument.\n\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\nThe elevation of the national monument is between 7,200 and 8,200 ft (2,200 and 2,500 m), and the flora and fauna are typical of the western Sierra Nevada at these elevations. The monument area contains animals and plants such as black bears, pine martens, mule deer, coyotes, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, alder, and willows, Dark-eyed juncos and white-crowned sparrows are common in the summer.\nNative wildflowers include:\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe most common method for accessing Devils Postpile is via the mandatory shuttle bus operated by Eastern Sierra Transit Authority in the summer months at the price of $15 for an adult, followed by a 1/4 mile walk. The shuttle route begins at Mammoth Mountain Ski Area's Adventure Center and makes several stops throughout the valley and begins operating when the Reds Meadow Road opens in the summer, and continues through Labor Day weekend.\nDevils Postpile is also accessible on foot from Mammoth Lakes by hiking over Mammoth Pass and into the Reds Meadow Valley. During the winter months, there are no services available, but adventurers can visit the site via cross-country ski or snowshoe.\nDue to the Reds Meadow Road reconstruction project for the 2024 season, entry is limited to Friday starting at 9 AM, all day Saturday, and Sunday until 11 PM, this schedule until September 15, 2024. From then until the winter closure, it‚Äôs only open on Saturdays and Sundays from 9 AM to 7 PM, and there‚Äôs no shuttle. It‚Äôs closed on other days for reconstruction of the road to improve access and safety.\n\n\n== Devils Postpile ==\n\nThe name \"Devils Postpile\" refers to a dark cliff of columnar basalt. Radiometric dating indicates the formation was created by a lava flow at some time less than 100,000 years ago. The source of the lava is thought to have been somewhere near Upper Soda Springs campground at the north end of Pumice Flat on the floor of the Middle Fork of the San Joaquin River, from where it flowed to the site of the Postpile. Estimates of the formation's thickness range from 400 feet (120 m) to 600 feet (180 m). The lava that now makes up the Postpile was near the bottom of this mass.\nBecause of its great thickness, much of the mass of pooled lava cooled slowly and evenly, which is why the column\nDevil facial tumour disease (DFTD) is an aggressive non-viral clonally transmissible cancer which affects Tasmanian devils, a marsupial native to the Australian island of Tasmania. The cancer manifests itself as lumps of soft and ulcerating tissue around the mouth, which may invade surrounding organs and metastasise to other parts of the body. Severe genetic abnormalities exist in cancer cells‚Äîfor example, DFT2 cells are tetraploid, containing twice as much genetic material as normal cells. DFTD is most often spread by bites, when teeth come into contact with cancer cells; less important pathways of transmission are ingesting of infected carcasses and sharing of food. Adult Tasmanian devils who are otherwise the fittest are most susceptible to the disease.\nDFTD is estimated to have first developed in 1986. There are two currently existing strains, both appearing to be derived from Schwann cells. DFT1 is the main and older strain that infects most of the devil population. It was first described in 1996 in an animal from Mount William National Park in northeastern Tasmania. DFT2 appeared around 2011 and was first detected in 2014; all cases are limited to the area of southern Tasmania near the D'Entrecasteaux Channel. There still remain disease-free pockets in the relatively isolated south-west of the island.\nThe disease poses a direct threat to the survival of Tasmanian devils as a species as the disease is almost universally fatal. In the two decades since the disease was first spotted, population of Devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) declined by 80% (locally exceeding 90%), as the condition spread through virtually entire Tasmania. The Tasmanian Government, Australian universities and zoos are engaged in efforts to curb the disease. Culling infected individuals, the policy used by state officials until 2010, brought little success. Thus the main prevention method became taking hundreds of devils into captivity and then releasing some of them into the wild. There is no cure for the cancer so far. Vaccination offers some promise in the fight against the pathogen, but researchers have not found a suitable candidate yet. A 2017 vaccine trial found that only 1 in 5 devils could resist DFTD; a DFT1 oral vaccine candidate is being tested in the captive devil population.\n\n\n== Clinical signs ==\nThere is often more than one primary tumour. Visible signs of DFTD begin with lumps of soft tissue around the mouth, which ulcerate. Tumours are locally aggressive, destroying the underlying bone of the jaw which interferes with feeding. Tumours may also cover the eyes. Devils usually die within six months from organ failure, secondary infection, or metabolic starvation.\nDFTD is rare in juveniles. It affects males and females equally.\n\n\n== Transmission ==\nThe most plausible route of transmission is through biting, particularly when canine teeth come into direct contact with the diseased cells. Other modes of transmission may include the ingestion of infected carcasses and the sharing of food, both of which involve an allogeneic transfer of cells between unrelated individuals. The animals most likely to become infected are the fittest devil individuals.\n\n\n== Pathology ==\nDFTD tumours are large soft tissue masses which become centrally ulcerated. The tumours are composed of lobules of nodules of round to spindle-shaped cells, often within a pseudocapsule. Tumours metastasise to regional lymph nodes involvement and systemically to the lungs, spleen and heart. \n\n\n== Tumour characteristics ==\n\nTasmanian devil cells have 14 chromosomes; the oldest-known strain of the tumour cells have thirteen chromosomes, nine of which are recognisable and four of which are mutated \"marker\" chromosomes. More recently evolved strains have an additional mutant marker chromosome, for a total of fourteen chromosomes. Researchers identified the cancer as a neuroendocrine tumour, and found identical chromosomal rearrangements in all the cancer cells. The karyotype anomalies of\nA devil is the mythical personification of evil as it is conceived in various cultures and religious traditions. It is seen as the objectification of a hostile and destructive force. Jeffrey Burton Russell states that the different conceptions of the devil can be summed up as 1) a principle of evil independent from God, 2) an aspect of God, 3) a created being turning evil (a fallen angel) or 4) a symbol of human evil.:‚Ää23‚Ää\nEach tradition, culture, and religion with a devil in its mythos offers a different lens on manifestations of evil. The history of these perspectives intertwines with theology, mythology, psychiatry, art, and literature, developing independently within each of the traditions. It occurs historically in many contexts and cultures, and is given many different names‚ÄîSatan (Judaism), Lucifer (Christianity), Beelzebub (Judeo-Christian), Mephistopheles (German), Iblis (Islam)‚Äîand attributes: it is portrayed as blue, black, or red; it is portrayed as having horns on its head, and without horns, and so on.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Modern English word devil derives from the Middle English devel, from the Old English dƒìofol, that in turn represents an early Germanic borrowing of the Latin diabolus. This in turn was borrowed from the Greek Œ¥ŒπŒ¨Œ≤ŒøŒªŒøœÇ di√°bolos, \"slanderer\", from Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ≤Œ¨ŒªŒªŒµŒπŒΩ diab√°llein, \"to slander\" from Œ¥ŒπŒ¨ di√°, \"across, through\" and Œ≤Œ¨ŒªŒªŒµŒπŒΩ b√°llein, \"to hurl\", probably akin to the Sanskrit gurate, \"he lifts up\".\n\n\n== Definitions ==\nIn his book The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity, Jeffrey Burton Russell discusses various meanings and difficulties that are encountered when using the term devil.  He does not claim to define the word in a general sense, but he describes the limited use that he intends for the word in his book‚Äîlimited in order to \"minimize this difficulty\" and \"for the sake of clarity\". In this book Russell uses the word devil as \"the personification of evil found in a variety of cultures\", as opposed to the word Satan, which he reserves specifically for the figure in the Abrahamic religions.\nIn the Introduction to his book Satan: A Biography, Henry Ansgar Kelly discusses various considerations and meanings that he has encountered in using terms such as devil and Satan, etc. While not offering a general definition, he describes that in his book \"whenever diabolos is used as the proper name of Satan\", he signals it by using \"small caps\".\nThe Oxford English Dictionary has a variety of definitions for the meaning of \"devil\", supported by a range of citations: \"Devil\" may refer to Satan, the supreme spirit of evil, or one of Satan's emissaries or demons that populate Hell, or to one of the spirits that possess a demoniac person; \"devil\" may refer to one of the \"malignant deities\" feared and worshiped by \"heathen people\", a demon, a malignant being of superhuman powers; figuratively \"devil\" may be applied to a wicked person, or playfully to a rogue or rascal, or in empathy often accompanied by the word \"poor\" to a person‚Äî\"poor devil\".\n\n\n== Bah√° º√≠ Faith ==\nIn the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, a malevolent, superhuman entity such as a devil or satan is not believed to exist. However, these terms do appear in the Bah√° º√≠ writings, where they are used as metaphors for the lower nature of man. Human beings are seen to have free will, and are thus able to turn towards God and develop spiritual qualities or turn away from God and become immersed in their self-centered desires. Individuals who follow the temptations of the self and do not develop spiritual virtues are often described in the Bah√° º√≠ writings with the word satanic. The Bah√° º√≠ writings also state that the devil is a metaphor for the \"insistent self\" or \"lower self\", which is a self-serving inclination within each individual. Those who follow their lower nature are also described as followers of \"the Evil One\".\n\n\n== Christianity ==\n\nIn Christianity, the devil or Satan is a fallen angel who is the primary opponent of God.

Later on, Sorychta and Lombardo founded the band Grip Inc. He recorded four albums with Grip Inc.: Power of Inner Strength (1995), Nemesis (1997) Solidify (1999) and Incorporated (2004).\nSorychta is also well known as a record producer, working with such bands as Lacuna Coil, Sentenced, Tiamat, Samael, The Gathering, Tristania, Moonspell, and many others.  In 1995 he was nominated for a Grammi in Sweden as \"Producer of the Year\" for his recording of Wildhoney by Tiamat.\nIn 1999, he recorded the album Sleep of the Angels of the Greek metal band Rotting Christ as a session  musician.\nFollowing the activity suspension of Grip Inc. in 2006, he founded the gothic metal band Eyes of Eden. He recorded with this band the album Faith, released on 17 August 2007. \nAlso in 2006, he founded the thrash metal group Enemy of the Sun, which recorded the album Shadows, released on 7 December 2007.\nIn 2009, he worked with Floor Jansen and Joost van den Broek, former members of the Dutch band After Forever, on their then new project called ReVamp.\nHe is also a well-known guest player for several bands, e.g. Therion on their tour in 2010.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Enemy of the Sun ===\nShadows (2007) ‚Äì guitar, producer\nCaedium (2010) ‚Äì guitar, producer\n\n\n=== Eyes of Eden ===\nFaith (2007) ‚Äì guitar, producer\n\n\n=== Despair ===\nHistory of Hate (1988) ‚Äì guitar, vocals, producer\nDecay of Humanity (1990) ‚Äì guitar, producer\nBeyond Reason (1992) ‚Äì guitar, producer\n\n\n=== Grip Inc. ===\nPower of Inner Strength (1995) ‚Äì guitar, backing vocals, producer\nNemesis (1997) ‚Äì guitar, keyboards, producer\nSolidify (1999) ‚Äì guitar, keyboards, producer\nIncorporated (2004) ‚Äì guitar, backing vocals, producer\n\n\n=== Rotting Christ ===\nSleep of the Angels (1999) ‚Äì guitar (session)\n\n\n=== Voodoocult ===\nJesus Killing Machine (1994) ‚Äì guitar, producer\n\n\n=== As producer ===\n\nTiamat ‚Äì   The Astral Sleep (1991)  ‚Äì also guitar\nUnleashed ‚Äì   Where No Life Dwells (1991)\nSamael ‚Äì  Blood Ritual (1992)\nUnleashed ‚Äì  Shadows in the Deep (1992)\nTiamat ‚Äì  Clouds (1992)\nSamael ‚Äì  Ceremony of Opposites (1994)\nTiamat ‚Äì Wildhoney (1994) ‚Äì also keyboards\nMoonspell ‚Äì  Wolfheart (1995)\nAlastis ‚Äì  ...And Death Smiled (1995)\nSamael ‚Äì  Rebellion (EP) (1995)\nThe Gathering ‚Äì Mandylion (1995)\nMoonspell ‚Äì  Irreligious (1996)\nSamael ‚Äì  Passage (1996)\nSentenced ‚Äì Down  (1996) ‚Äì also keyboards\nAlastis ‚Äì  The Other Side (1997) ‚Äì also keyboards\nSamael ‚Äì  Exodus (1998)\nMoonspell ‚Äì  Sin/Pecado (1998)\nLacuna Coil ‚Äì Lacuna Coil (EP) (1998)\nAlastis ‚Äì  Revenge (1998)\nSentenced ‚Äì   Frozen (1998) ‚Äì also keyboards\nTherion ‚Äì Vovin  (1998) ‚Äì also guitar\nTherion ‚Äì  Crowning of Atlantis (1999) ‚Äì also guitar\nLacuna Coil ‚Äì In a Reverie (1999) ‚Äì also keyboards\nDismal Euphony ‚Äì  All Little Devils (1999) ‚Äì also guitar, keyboards\nTherion ‚Äì  Deggial (2000) ‚Äì also acoustic guitar\nLacuna Coil ‚Äì  Halflife (2000)\nFlowing Tears ‚Äì  Jade (2000)\nLacuna Coil ‚Äì Unleashed Memories (2001)\nLacuna Coil ‚Äì  Comalies (2002)\nFlowing Tears ‚Äì  Serpentine (2002)\nFlowing Tears ‚Äì Razorbliss (2005)\nSamael ‚Äì  Reign of Light (2005)\nLacuna Coil ‚Äì Karmacode (2006)\nMoonspell ‚Äì  Memorial (2006) also bass guitar\nTristania ‚Äì Illumination (2006‚Äì2007)\nSamael ‚Äì  Solar Soul (2007)\nRusty Eye ‚Äì  Possessor (2009) also guest guitar, keyboards and mixing.\nWitchbreed ‚Äì Heretic Rapture (2009)\nThe Very End ‚Äì Mercy & Misery (2010)\nSodom ‚Äì In War and Pieces (2010)\nThe Other ‚Äì New Blood (2010)\nSamael ‚Äì  Lux Mundi (2010)\nExumer ‚Äì Fire & Damnation (2012)\nThe Very End ‚Äì Turn Off the World (2012)\nSodom ‚Äì Epitome of Torture (2013)\nCharm Designer ‚Äì Everlasting (2016)\nSam\nThe Tasmanian Devil (also spelled Tazmanian Devil), commonly referred to as Taz, is an animated cartoon character featured in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons. Though the character appeared in only five shorts before Warner Bros. Cartoons shut down in 1964, marketing and television appearances later propelled Taz to new popularity in the 1990s.\n\n\n== Personality ==\nTaz is generally portrayed as a ferocious, albeit dim-witted, carnivore with a notoriously short temper and little patience. In the short Ducking the Devil, he is described as a \"vicious, evil-tempered brute with jaws like a steel trap\". Though he can be very devious, he is also sweet at times. His enormous appetite seems to know no bounds, as he will eat anything in his path. He is best known for his speech consisting mostly of grunts, growls, and rasps (in his earlier appearances, he does speak English with primitive grammar) as well as his ability to spin like a vortex and bite through nearly anything. While in motion, he's often depicted as a spinning tornado, drilling himself through trees or soil.   Taz does have one weakness: he can be calmed by almost any music. While in this calm state, he can be easily dealt with. The only music known not to pacify Taz is the bagpipes, which he finds insufferable.\n\n\n== Creation ==\nRobert McKimson designed the character based on the real Tasmanian devil, or more specifically its carnivorous nature, voracious appetite, and surly disposition. A later model sheet was created by animator Ted Bonnicksen.\nOwen and Pemberton suggest that the character of the Tasmanian Devil was inspired by Tasmanian actor Errol Flynn.:‚Ää153‚Ää In 1939, apparently at the request of Warner Bros., the Tasmanian state government had sent three Tasmanian devils to California, where they were presented to the Los Angeles Zoo by Flynn's co-stars the Lane Sisters. Two of the devils escaped from the zoo within months and were reported to be roaming Griffith Park.\n\n\n== Appearances ==\nIn his first appearance in McKimson's Devil May Hare (first released on June 19, 1954), Taz stalks Bugs Bunny, but due to his dimwittedness and inability to frame complete sentences, he serves as little more than a nuisance. Bugs eventually gets rid of him in the most logical way possible: matching him up with an equally insatiable Tasmanian She-Devil. The character's speech, a deep, gravelly voice peppered with growls, screeches, and raspberries, is provided by Mel Blanc. Only occasionally would Taz actually speak, usually to utter some incongruous punchline (e.g. \"What for you bury me in the cold, cold ground?\"), and yet the character is capable of writing and reading. A running gag is that when Bugs Bunny hears of the approach of Taz, he looks him up in an encyclopedia and starts reading off a list of animals that Taz eats (which is pretty much everything that exists, including \"people\"). Bugs finds \"rabbits\" not listed until Taz enters and either points out that \"rabbits\" are listed or writes rabbits on the list.\nAfter the film short debuted at theaters, producer Edward Selzer, head of the Warner Bros. animation studio, ordered McKimson to shelve the character, feeling that he was too violent for children, and that parents would dislike him.:‚Ää157‚Ää After a time with no new Taz shorts, studio head Jack L. Warner asked what had happened to the character. Warner saved Taz's career when he told Selzer that he had received \"boxes and boxes\" of letters from people who liked the character and wanted to see more of him.\nMcKimson would go on to direct four more Taz cartoons, beginning with Bedevilled Rabbit (released on April 13, 1957). McKimson would also pair the Devil with Daffy Duck in Ducking the Devil (August 17, 1957) before pitting him once again against Bugs in Bill of Hare (June 9, 1962) and Dr. Devil and Mr. Hare (March 28, 1964). His last two appearances done by the classic Warner Brothers directors, writers, and voice actors were in Bugs B\nThe Little Devil River is a river of the Tasman Region of New Zealand's South Island.

Most of these bridges are stone or masonry arch bridges and represent a significant technological achievement in ancient architecture. Due to their unusual design, they were an object of fascination and stories in antiquity and medieval Europe.\nEach of the Devil's bridges typically has a corresponding Devil-related myth or folktale regarding its origin. These stories vary widely depending on the region and beliefs. Some have the Devil as the builder of the bridge, relating to the precariousness or impossibility of such a bridge to last or exist in the first place, so much so that only the Devil himself could have built it. Others have the knowledge to build such bridges given to mankind as a gift from the Devil as part of a deal, pact or bargain between the Devil and local populace, usually in exchange for their souls.\n\n\n== Associated legends ==\n\nThe bridges that fall into the Devil's Bridge category are so numerous that the legends about them form a special category in the Aarne-Thompson (AT) classification system for folktales (Number 1191). Some legends have elements of related folktale-categories, for example Deceiving the Devil (AT #1196), The Devil's Contract (AT #756B), and The Master Builder legends.\nOne version of the tale presents the bridge builder and the Devil as adversaries. This reflects the fact that frequently, such as in the case of the Teufelsbr√ºcke at the St Gotthard Pass, these bridges were built under such challenging conditions that successful completion of the bridge required a heroic effort on the part of the builders and the community, ensuring its legendary status.\nOther versions of the legend feature an old lady or a simple herder who makes a pact with the Devil. In this version the devil agrees to build the bridge, in return receiving the first soul to cross it. After building the bridge (often overnight) the devil is outwitted by his adversary (for example, by throwing bread to lure a dog over the bridge first) and is last seen descending into the water, bringing peace to the community.\nIn the case of the Steinerne Br√ºcke in Regensburg, the legend speaks of the devil helping in a race between the builders of the bridge and of the cathedral (in fact a significantly later construction), and a slight bump in the middle of the bridge is said to result from the devil's leaping with rage upon being tricked out of his prize.\nIn the legend of Teufelsbr√ºck in Hamburg, which leads only over a small stream, the carpenter, in a pact with the devil, promised him the first soul to cross the bridge. On the day of inauguration, while the priest and county councillor debated who should step on the bridge first, a rabbit crossed it and the disappointed devil disappeared. A statue refers to the legend there.\nThe legend of Ponte della Maddalena in Borgo a Mozzano, Province of Lucca, tells of a local saint (often Saint Julian, the Hospitaller) who makes the pact with the devil. On the day of delivery, the saint sets fire to a dog or a pig, which crosses the bridge and deceives the devil.\nAt Sens, a thirteenth-century legend tells of an architect who sold his soul to the devil and then subsequently repented. M. le Cur√© of Sens drove the devil away with holy water and with an exorcism formula beginning with the words Vade retro satana, which he made the penitent repeat.\nThe formula was, at some time, incorporated into the design of the popular Saint Benedict Medal.\nMost of the bridges that have received the \"Devil's Bridge\" appellation are remarkable in some regard, most often for the technological hurdles surpassed in building the bridge, but on occasion for its aesthetic grace as well, or for its economic or strategic importance to the community it serves.\n\n\n== List of bridges ==\n\n\n=== Antigua and Barbuda ===\nDevil's Bridge ‚Äì Antigua\n\n\n=== Argentina ===\nPuente La Noria ‚Äì Buenos Aires\n\n\n=== Bulgaria ===\nDyavolski most (–î—è–≤–æ–ª—Å–∫–∏ –º–æ\nThe Dark Pictures Anthology is an anthology series of interactive drama and survival horror video games developed and published by Supermassive Games (first season published by Bandai Namco Entertainment).

Jung Tae-seok is a cop who goes through the crime scene and suspects it to be the work of a serial killer, but his commanding officer does not believe him. Jang Dong-soo is a crime boss who, while on his way home after a meeting, is hit by the same killer, who tries to kill him as well. A brutal fight ensues, leaving both of them injured. Finally, the killer escapes after hitting Dong-soo with his car. Dong-soo is admitted to the hospital, and his henchmen assume that the attack was committed by a rival gang, whom they counter-attack.\nHowever, Dong-soo believes the killer was not a rival gang member as his moves seemed to be random and purposeless. Tae-suk visits Dong-soo at the hospital and asks him to cooperate so that the police can catch the killer for him, but Dong-soo refuses. Instead, Dong-soo orders his men to find the killer. Using a sketch and Dong-soo's memory of the killer's license plate, they manage to find his car and a knife. Dong-soo eventually informs Tae-suk of the findings, and they decide to team up to catch the mysterious killer. Dong-soo agrees to provide manpower and cover expenses ‚Äî but on the condition that the killer belongs to the one who finds him first. Dong-soo wants to kill him for revenge while Tae-suk wants to arrest him in order to solve five connected murder cases and eventually get promoted.\nMeanwhile, Dong-soo orders his right-hand man, Kwon Oh-sung, to kill his rival Heo Sang-do with the killer's knife that already has traces of blood from the killer's previous victims. An enraged Tae-suk gets into a fight with Dong-soo upon learning what he has done as the killing is confirmed to be the work of a serial killer, causing the case to be transferred to the major case squad. Dong-soo attends Sang-do's funeral; the killer also turns up and informs Sang-do's second-in-command that Sang-do was killed with the killer's knife, but by someone else. When Tae-suk and Dong-soo check the killer's car for any evidence, they are attacked by Sang-do's henchmen. A fight ensues, resulting in the death of Sang-do's right-hand man while in a fight with Tae-suk.\nDong-soo gets him buried and clears the scene. Tae-suk gets assigned to investigate a kidnapping case and, while solving it, spots the killer. A chase ensues, but the killer is able to escape. Through forensic test, Tae-suk discovers the killer to be a missing person. He informs Dong-soo about this and lets him hear a voice clip to confirm the missing person is the killer. Later, Dong-soo helps a high school girl by giving her his umbrella but soon learns that the girl has been murdered and his umbrella was found at the crime scene. Dong-soo and Tae-suk and their men start looking for the killer in the area where the girl was murdered and eventually find him in a car. In the ensuing chase, the killer manages to kill Oh-sung but is finally captured and incapacitated by Dong-soo. Dong-soo takes the killer away to torture and kill him, but Tae-suk tracks them down and crashes his car into the hideout just as Dong-soo is about to kill the killer.  Tae-suk hits Dong-soo with his car and arrests the killer.\nThe police have no conclusive evidence against the killer, Kang Kyu\nLittle Nicky is a 2000 American action fantasy black comedy film directed by Steven Brill, written by Tim Herlihy, Adam Sandler, and Brill, and starring Sandler in the title role, Patricia Arquette, Harvey Keitel, Tommy \"Tiny\" Lister Jr., Rhys Ifans, and Rodney Dangerfield with supporting roles by Allen Covert, Kevin Nealon, Jon Lovitz, Michael McKean, and Quentin Tarantino.\nThe film depicts the son of Satan and an angel who is tasked with returning his two brothers to Hell and preventing them from destroying the boundary between good and evil on Earth.\nLittle Nicky established the shared universe of Adam Sandler's films. The film received negative reviews from critics and was a box office bomb, grossing $58.3 million against an $80‚Äì85 million budget.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nWith his 10,000-year reign coming to an end, Satan must decide which of his three sons will succeed him as ruler of Hell. Adrian is the most devious, Cassius is the cruelest and Nicky is the kindest. Nicky has had a speech impediment and a disfigured jaw since Cassius hit him in the face with a shovel. Satan assembles his sons to tell them that as they are not yet ready to succeed him, he will continue ruling Hell.\nAngered by this decision, Adrian and Cassius travel to Earth to create a new Hell by possessing religious and political leaders in New York City. As they leave, they freeze the entrance to Hell, preventing more evil souls from entering and causing Satan to begin to disintegrate. Stanley the Gatekeeper informs Satan of this and Satan punishes him by growing breasts on his head and giving him to his father Lucifer. Now very weak, to stop Adrian and Cassius, he sends Nicky to Earth with a silver flask that traps whoever drinks from it inside.\nNicky has difficulty surviving on Earth and is killed several times, landing in Hell and returning to New York each time. While learning how to eat and sleep, he meets a possessed talking bulldog named Mr. Beefy, rents an apartment with an actor named Todd and falls in love with a design student named Valerie. Nicky encounters Adrian but fails to capture him and scares Valerie away. Nicky then observes Cassius on television possessing the referee of a Harlem Globetrotters game. Nicky arrives at the game and successfully tricks Cassius into the flask. Satanist metalheads John and Peter swear loyalty to Nicky. That evening, Nicky apologizes to Valerie and they reconcile.\nThe following day, Adrian possesses the Chief of the NYPD and accuses Nicky of mass murder. Nicky has Todd kill him so he can go back to Hell and ask his father for advice. However, Satan has trouble hearing because his ears have fallen off, and his assistants are panicking because the deadline to capture Adrian and Cassius is approaching.\nBack on Earth, Nicky and his friends devise a plan to capture Adrian in a subway station. Adrian discovers their trick and in the ensuing fight, grabs Valerie and dives onto the track as a train approaches, but Nicky throws her aside, leaving himself and Adrian to be killed by the train.\nArriving in Hell just minutes before midnight, Adrian begins taking over Hell by pushing what remains of his father aside and sitting on the throne, rising to Central Park, and starting a riotous party. Meanwhile, Nicky wakes up in Heaven as a reward for sacrificing himself and meets his mother Holly, an angel who tells him that he can defeat Adrian with the \"inner light\" that he inherited from her.\nAfter she gives him a mysterious orb, he confronts Adrian in Central Park. Adrian appears to win the battle by transforming into a bat and locking Nicky in the flask. However, Nicky escapes from the flask and shatters the orb, causing Ozzy Osbourne to appear, bite off Adrian's head, and spit it into the flask.\nWith his brothers captured, Nicky prepares to save his father. He and Valerie express their love for each other and she kills him. In Hell, Satan regains his body and suggests Nicky stay with Valerie to maintain things in the middle whi",

It is characterised by its stocky and muscular build, black fur, pungent odour, extremely loud and disturbing screech, keen sense of smell, and ferocity when feeding.

However, that particular binomial name had been given to the common wombat (later reclassified as Vombatus ursinus) by George Shaw in 1800, and was hence unavailable. In 1838, a specimen was named Dasyurus laniarius by Richard Owen, but by 1877 he had relegated it to Sarcophilus.

Little Butch rescues Doc, and soon after, the Japanese bomb the mission.\nLater, an American aircraft crashes, and the Little Devils race with the Japanese to reach the wreck. The Little Devils find the aircraft first and are surprised to discover that the pilot is Big Butch. After treating Big Butch's wounds, the Little Devils help him cross a river and return safely to the Chinese lines.\nAs the young boys are escaping, however, a Japanese patrol converges on them. They sacrifice their lives while shooting it out with the enemy, and sometime later, the spirit of Little Butch rides with Big Butch, as he drops bombs on Tokyo."

He sits in a clearing with his father, Willard, on an oak log, joining him in his evening prayer routine. Willard is borderline obsessive when it comes to prayer and expects the same from his son. While Arvin prays, however, his mind wanders and feelings of isolation bubble to the surface. Feeling like an outsider at school, he is the victim of relentless bullying. Arvin recalls his father telling him to stand up for himself, but this is easier said than done."

The Tasmanian Government, Australian universities and zoos are engaged in efforts to curb the disease. Culling infected individuals, the policy used by state officials until 2010, brought little success. Thus the main prevention method became taking hundreds of devils into captivity and then releasing some of them into the wild. There is no cure for the cancer so far. Vaccination offers some promise in the fight against the pathogen, but researchers have not found a suitable candidate yet.

Only occasionally would Taz actually speak, usually to utter some incongruous punchline (e.g. \"What for you bury me in the cold, cold ground?\"), and yet the character is capable of writing and reading. A running gag is that when Bugs Bunny hears of the approach of Taz, he looks him up in an encyclopedia and starts reading off a list of animals that Taz eats (which is pretty much everything that exists, including \"people\").
