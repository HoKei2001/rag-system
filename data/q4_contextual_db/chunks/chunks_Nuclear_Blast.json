        "content": "Nuclear Blast Records is a German record label with subsidiaries in Germany, the United States and Brazil. It was founded in 1987 by Markus Staiger in Donzdorf. Originally releasing hardcore punk records, the label moved on to releasing albums by thrash metal, melodic death metal, grindcore, industrial metal, power metal and black metal bands, as well as tribute albums. It also distributes and promotes post-hardcore/metalcore labels SharpTone Records; another post-hardcore/metalcore label, Arising Empire, was in Nuclear Blast portfolio until its acquirement by Kontor New Media in 2020.\nIn October 2018, French independent label Believe Digital acquired a majority stake in Nuclear Blast.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nNuclear Blast was formed in 1987 after founder Markus Staiger traveled throughout the United States for four weeks and saw a gig of his favorite band BL'AST!. The label's first release was a vinyl compilation called Senseless Death (NB 001) featuring US hardcore bands like Attitude, Sacred Denial, Impulse Manslaughter and others.\nSwedish band Meshuggah became the first band in the history of Nuclear Blast Records to crack the Billboard 200, landing at number 165 with their 2002 album, Nothing. Meshuggah also became the first Nuclear Blast band to be reviewed in Rolling Stone magazine.\nIn 2004, Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish released Once on Nuclear Blast, which rocketed to the top of the charts in multiple countries, including Finland, Germany, Norway, Greece, Sweden, Austria, and more. It became the first release in the company's history to reach number 1 on the German charts. Slayer released the album Repentless in 2015 which went to number 4 on the Billboard 200 making it the highest charting Nuclear Blast release in the United States.\nDuring the 2000s and 2010s, Nuclear Blast signed many veteran thrash metal bands including Slayer, Exodus, Testament, Anthrax, Kreator, Overkill, Sepultura, Destruction, Tankard, Death Angel, and Heathen.\nIn 2021, Nuclear Blast founder Markus Staiger launched a new record company called Atomic Fire GmbH.\nIn June 2022, Nuclear Blast unveiled a new logo. The logo caused some controversy when the canned water company Liquid Death jokingly noted its similarities with their logo (which also features a melting skull), inadvertedly leading to its designer, Justin Moll, receiving hate mail. Liquid Death quickly apologized for the joke, saying that it was not targeted at Moll but at Nuclear Blast, whose personnel had reportedly raised concerns over the new logo's similarities with Liquid Death's before it was implemented.\nOn 23 August 2022, the video game Saints Row was released, which features an in-game radio station that includes Nuclear Blast artists.\n\n\n== Blood Blast Distribution ==\nBlood Blast Distribution is a subsidiary of Nuclear Blast that focuses solely on the distribution of extreme music. The company was founded in 2020 by Bryce Lucien, Jerome Riera, Denis Ladegaillerie and Myriam Silberstein.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Nuclear Blast artists\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNuclear Blast Europe\nA nuclear explosion is an explosion that occurs as a result of the rapid release of energy from a high-speed nuclear reaction. The driving reaction may be nuclear fission or nuclear fusion or a multi-stage cascading combination of the two, though to date all fusion-based weapons have used a fission device to initiate fusion, and a pure fusion weapon remains a hypothetical device. Nuclear explosions are used in nuclear weapons and nuclear testing.\nNuclear explosions are extremely destructive compared to conventional (chemical) explosives, because of the vastly greater energy density of nuclear fuel compared to chemical explosives. They are often associated with mushroom clouds, since any large atmospheric explosion can create such a cloud. Nuclear explosions produce high levels of ionizing radiation and radioactive debris that is harmful to humans and can cause moderate to severe skin burns, eye damage, radiation sickness, radiation-induced cancer and possible death depending on how far a person is from the blast radius. Nuclear explosions can also have detrimental effects on the climate, lasting from months to years. A small-scale nuclear war could release enough particles into the atmosphere to cause the planet to cool and cause crops, animals, and agriculture to disappear across the globe—an effect named nuclear winter.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The beginning (fission explosions) ===\nThe first manmade nuclear explosion occurred on July 16, 1945, at 5:50 am on the Trinity test site near Alamogordo, New Mexico, in the United States, an area now known as the White Sands Missile Range. The event involved the full-scale testing of an implosion-type fission atomic bomb. In a memorandum to the U.S. Secretary of War, General Leslie Groves describes the yield as equivalent to 15,000 to 20,000 tons of TNT. Following this test, a uranium-gun type nuclear bomb (Little Boy) was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, with a blast yield of 15 kilotons; and a plutonium implosion-type bomb (Fat Man) on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945, with a blast yield of 21 kilotons. Fat Man and Little Boy are the only instances in history of nuclear weapons being used as an act of war.\nOn August 29, 1949, the USSR became the second country to successfully test a nuclear weapon. RDS-1, dubbed \"First Lightning\" by the Soviets and \"Joe-1\" by the US, produced a 20 kiloton explosion and was essentially a copy of the American Fat Man plutonium implosion design.\n\n\n=== Thermonuclear Era (fusion explosions) ===\nThe United States' first thermonuclear weapon, Ivy Mike, was detonated on 1 November 1952 at Enewetak Atoll and yielded 10 Megatons of explosive force. The first thermonuclear weapon tested by the USSR, RDS-6s (Joe-4), was detonated on August 12, 1953, at the Semipalatinsk Test Site in Kazakhstan and yielded about 400 kilotons. RDS-6s' design, nicknamed the Sloika, was remarkably similar to a version designed for the U.S. by Edward Teller nicknamed the \"Alarm Clock\", in that the nuclear device was a two-stage weapon: the first explosion was triggered by fission and the second more powerful explosion by fusion. The Sloika core consisted of a series of concentric spheres with alternating materials to help boost the explosive yield.\n\n\n=== Proliferation Era ===\nIn the years following World War II, eight countries have conducted nuclear tests with 2475 devices fired in 2120 tests. In 1963, the United States, Soviet Union, and United Kingdom signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty, pledging to refrain from testing nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, underwater, or in outer space. The treaty permitted underground tests. Many other non-nuclear nations acceded to the Treaty following its entry into force; however, France and China (both nuclear weapons states) have not.\nThe primary application to date has been military (i.e. nuclear weapons), and the remainder of explosions include the following:\n\nNuclear pulse propulsion, including using a nuclear explosion \nThe effects of a nuclear explosion on its immediate vicinity are typically much more destructive and multifaceted than those caused by conventional explosives. In most cases, the energy released from a nuclear weapon detonated within the lower atmosphere can be approximately divided into four basic categories:\n\nthe blast and shock wave: 50% of total energy\nthermal radiation: 35% of total energy\nionizing radiation: 5% of total energy (more in a neutron bomb)\nresidual radiation: 5–10% of total energy with the mass of the explosion.\nDepending on the design of the weapon and the location in which it is detonated, the energy distributed to any one of these categories may be significantly higher or lower. The physical blast effect is created by the coupling of immense amounts of energy, spanning the electromagnetic spectrum, with the surroundings. The environment of the explosion (e.g. submarine, ground burst, air burst, or exo-atmospheric) determines how much energy is distributed to the blast and how much to radiation. In general, surrounding a bomb with denser media, such as water, absorbs more energy and creates more powerful shock waves while at the same time limiting the area of its effect. When a nuclear weapon is surrounded only by air, lethal blast and thermal effects proportionally scale much more rapidly than lethal radiation effects as explosive yield increases. This bubble is faster than the speed of sound. The physical damage mechanisms of a nuclear weapon (blast and thermal radiation) are identical to those of conventional explosives, but the energy produced by a nuclear explosion is usually millions of times more powerful per unit mass, and temperatures may briefly reach the tens of millions of degrees.\nEnergy from a nuclear explosion is initially released in several forms of penetrating radiation. When there is surrounding material such as air, rock, or water, this radiation interacts with and rapidly heats the material to an equilibrium temperature (i.e. so that the matter is at the same temperature as the fuel powering the explosion). This causes vaporization of the surrounding material, resulting in its rapid expansion. Kinetic energy created by this expansion contributes to the formation of a shock wave which expands spherically from the center. Intense thermal radiation at the hypocenter forms a nuclear fireball which, if the explosion is low enough in altitude, is often associated with a mushroom cloud. In a high-altitude burst where the density of the atmosphere is low, more energy is released as ionizing gamma radiation and X-rays than as an atmosphere-displacing shockwave.\n\n\n== Direct effects ==\n\n\n=== Blast damage ===\n\nThe high temperatures and radiation cause gas to move outward radially in a thin, dense shell called \"the hydrodynamic front\". The front acts like a piston that pushes against and compresses the surrounding medium to make a spherically expanding shock wave. At first, this shock wave is inside the surface of the developing fireball, which is created in a volume of air heated by the explosion's \"soft\" X-rays. Within a fraction of a second, the dense shock front obscures the fireball and continues to move past it, expanding outwards and free from the fireball, causing a reduction of light emanating from a nuclear detonation. Eventually the shock wave dissipates to the point where the light becomes visible again giving rise to the characteristic double flash caused by the shock wave–fireball interaction. It is this unique feature of nuclear explosions that is exploited when verifying that an atmospheric nuclear explosion has occurred and not simply a large conventional explosion, with radiometer instruments known as Bhangmeters capable of determining the nature of explosions.\nFor air bursts at or near sea level, 50–60% of the explosion's energy goes into the blast wave, depending on the size and the yield of the bomb. As a general rule, the blast fraction is higher for low yield weapons.

An explosive yield of one terajoule is equal to 0.239 kilotonnes of TNT. Because the accuracy of any measurement of the energy released by TNT has always been problematic, the conventional definition is that one kilotonne of TNT is held simply to be equivalent to 1012 calories.\nThe yield-to-weight ratio is the amount of weapon yield compared to the mass of the weapon. The practical maximum yield-to-weight ratio for fusion weapons (thermonuclear weapons) has been estimated to six megatonnes of TNT per tonne of bomb mass (25 TJ/kg). Yields of 5.2 megatonnes/tonne and higher have been reported for large weapons constructed for single-warhead use in the early 1960s. Since then, the smaller warheads needed to achieve the increased net damage efficiency (bomb damage/bomb mass) of multiple warhead systems have resulted in increases in the yield/mass ratio for single modern warheads.\n\n\n== Examples of nuclear weapon yields ==\nIn order of increasing yield (most yield figures are approximate):\n\nIn comparison, the blast yield of the GBU-43 Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb is 0.011 kt, and that of the Oklahoma City bombing, using a truck-based fertilizer bomb, was 0.002 kt. The estimated strength of the explosion at the Port of Beirut is 0.3-0.5 kt. Most artificial non-nuclear explosions are considerably smaller than even what are considered to be very small nuclear weapons.\n\n\n=== Yield limits ===\nThe yield-to-mass ratio is the amount of weapon yield compared to the mass of the weapon. The highest achieved values are somewhat lower, and the value tends to be lower for smaller, lighter weapons, of the sort that are emphasized in today's arsenals, designed for efficient MIRV use or delivery by cruise missile systems.\n\nThe 25 Mt yield option reported for the B41 would give it a yield-to-mass ratio of 5.1 megatonnes of TNT per tonne. While this would require a far greater efficiency than any other current U.S. weapon (at least 40% efficiency in a fusion fuel of lithium deuteride), this was apparently attainable, probably by the use of higher than normal lithium-6 enrichment in the lithium deuteride fusion fuel. This results in the B41 still retaining the record for the highest yield-to-mass weapon ever designed.\nThe W56 demonstrated a yield-to-mass ratio of 4.96 kt per kilogram of device mass, and very close to the predicted 5.1 kt/kg achievable in the highest yield-to-mass weapon ever built, the 25-megatonne B41. Unlike the B41, which was never proof-tested at full yield, the W56 demonstrated its efficiency in the XW-56X2 Bluestone shot of Operation Dominic in 1962, thus, from information available in the public domain, the W56 may hold the distinction of demonstrating the highest efficiency in a nuclear weapon to date.\nIn 1963 DOE declassified statements that the U.S. had the technological capability of deploying a 35 Mt warhead on the Titan II, or a 50–60 Mt gravity bomb on B-52s. Neither weapon was pursued, but either would require yield-to-mass ratios superior to a 25 Mt Mk-41.\nFor current smaller US weapons, yield is 600 to 2200 kilotonnes of TNT per tonne. By comparison, for the very small tactical devices such as the Davy Crockett it was 0.4 to 40 kilotonnes of TNT per tonne. For historical comparison, for Little Boy the yield was only 4 kilotonnes of TNT per tonne, and for the largest Tsar Bomba, the yield was 2 megatonnes of TNT per tonne (deliberately reduced from about twice as much yield for the same weapon, so there is little doubt that this bomb as designed was capable of 4 megato\nA blast shelter is a place where people can go to protect themselves from blasts and explosions, like those from bombs, or in hazardous worksites, such as on oil and gas refineries or petrochemical facilities. It differs from a fallout shelter, in that its main purpose is to protect from shock waves and overpressure instead of from radioactive precipitation, as a fallout shelter does. It is also possible for a shelter to protect from both blasts and fallout.\nBlast shelters are a vital form of protection from nuclear attacks and are employed in civil defense. There are above-ground, below-ground, dedicated, dual-purpose, and potential blast shelters. Dedicated blast shelters are built specifically for the purpose of blast protection (see bunker). Dual-purpose blast shelters are existing structures with blast-protective properties that have been modified to accommodate people seeking protection from blasts. Potential blast shelters are existing structures or geological features exhibiting blast-protective properties that have potential to be used for protection from blasts.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\nBlast shelters deflect the blast wave from nearby explosions to prevent ear and internal injuries to people sheltering in the bunker. While frame buildings collapse from as little as 3 psi (20 kPa) of overpressure, blast shelters are regularly constructed to survive several hundred psi. This substantially decreases the likelihood that a bomb can harm the structure.\nThe basic plan is to provide a structure that is very strong in compression. The actual strength specification must be done individually, based on the nature and probability of the threat. A typical specification for heavy civil defence shelter in Europe during the Cold war was an overhead explosion of a 500 kiloton weapon at the height of 500 meters. Such a weapon would be used to attack soft targets (factories, administrative centres, communications) in the area.\nOnly the most heavy bedrock-shelters would stand a chance of surviving. However, in the countryside or in a suburb, the likely distance to the explosion is much larger, as it is improbable that anyone would waste an expensive nuclear device on such targets. The most common purpose-built structure is a steel-reinforced concrete vault or arch buried or located in the basement of a house.\nMost expedient blast shelters are civil engineering structures that contain large buried tubes or pipes such as sewage or rapid transit tunnels. Even these, nonetheless, require several additions to serve properly: blast doors, air-filtration and ventilation equipment, secondary exits, and air-proofing.\nImprovised purpose-built blast shelters normally use earthen arches or vaults. To form these, a narrow (1-2 metre-wide) flexible tent of thin wood is placed in a deep trench (usually the apex of the tent is below grade), and then covered with cloth or plastic, and then covered with 1–2 meters of tamped earth. Shelters of this type are approved field expedient blast shelters of both the U.S. and China. Entrances are constructed from thick wooden frames. Blast valves are to be constructed from tire-treads laid on thick wooden grids.\nNuclear bunkers must also cope with the underpressure that lasts for several seconds after the shock wave passes, and prompt radiation. The overburden and structure provide substantial radiation shielding, and the negative pressure is usually only 1/3 of the overpressure.\nThe doors must be at least as strong as the walls. The usual design is a trap-door, to minimize the size and expense. In dual-purpose shelters, which have a secondary peacetime use, the door may be normal. To reduce the weight, the door is normally constructed of steel, with a fitted steel lintel and frame welded to the steel-reinforcement of the concrete. The shelter should be located so that there is no combustible material directly outside it.\nIf the door is on the surface and will be exposed to the blast wave, the edge of the door is normally \nHoward Jones (born July 20, 1970) is an American metalcore vocalist best known as the former lead singer of Killswitch Engage and Blood Has Been Shed. He is the current vocalist of Light the Torch, formerly known as Devil You Know, and SION with YouTuber/guitarist Jared Dines.\n\n\n== Career ==\nJones started making music in the underground band Driven in 1996, releasing a single album. He later performed with Blood Has Been Shed from 1997 to 2004. In 2002, he joined Killswitch Engage as their new vocalist after Jesse Leach left the band. During his time with Killswitch Engage, they released two gold-certified albums, The End of Heartache and As Daylight Dies, as well as a second self-titled album. Jones left the band after nearly ten years in 2012, but remained a close friend. He would go on to collaborate with them again for the single \"The Signal Fire\" from their album Atonement. His later band Light the Torch would also tour with Killswitch Engage, and he would appear with the band onstage to perform the song, as well as other songs from his time with them, often as a duet alongside Leach.\nJones started a new band Devil You Know with guitarist Francesco Artusato (All Shall Perish) and drummer John Sankey (Devolved, Fear Factory and Divine Heresy). After Sankey's departure and his attempt to claim the copyright of the band's name, the rest of the band members started again with a fresh name, Light the Torch, with the addition of a new drummer.\nIn March 2021, Jones joined with heavy metal YouTuber Jared Dines and producer Hiram Hernandez to release \"The Blade\" as part of a new project named Sion.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nJones is an avid fisherman and owns property on the Red River of the North in Manitoba, Canada. He is a frequent guest on Jamey Jasta's podcast on the GaS Digital Network. Jones left Killswitch Engage in early 2012 to allow himself to manage his type 2 diabetes, which was worsened by a hectic touring lifestyle. In 2013, Jones stated that his diabetes put him in a coma for three days.\nIn 2015, Jones revealed that he had struggled with anxiety and depression for a long time, which had been worsened by his rise to fame in Killswitch Engage. He revealed that he had come close to committing suicide in 2009, when he had aimed a .44 Magnum revolver at his head in his apartment in Connecticut, and that the police had intervened after being notified by a concerned neighbor. In 2018, he teamed up with his former band to raise awareness for mental health; the resulting song \"The Signal Fire\" appears on the 2019 album Atonement.\nJones used to be straight edge. Today, he shares a passion for medical cannabis with friend and fellow Killswitch Engage frontman Jesse Leach.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nBlood Has Been Shed\nI Dwell on Thoughts of You (September 21, 1999, Ferret Records)\nNovella of Uriel (February 20, 2001, Ferret Records)\nSpirals (March 11, 2003, Ferret Records)\nKillswitch Engage\nThe End of Heartache (May 11, 2004, Roadrunner Records)\nAs Daylight Dies (November 21, 2006, Roadrunner Records)\nKillswitch Engage (June 30, 2009, Roadrunner Records)\nLight the Torch (formerly Devil You Know)\nThe Beauty of Destruction (April 25, 2014, Nuclear Blast)\nThey Bleed Red (November 6, 2015, Nuclear Blast)\nRevival (March 30, 2018, Nuclear Blast)\nYou Will Be the Death of Me (June 25, 2021, Nuclear Blast)\nSION\nSION (November 26, 2021, Independent)\n\n\n=== Guest appearances ===\nFragment – Answers (\"Inertia\") *First ever guest appearance\n36 Crazyfists – Rest Inside the Flames (\"Elysium\")\nDemon Hunter – Summer of Darkness (\"Our Faces Fall Apart\")\nEighteen Visions – Vanity (\"One Hell of a Prize Fighter\")\nRoadrunner United – All-Star Sessions (\"The Dagger\")\nThrowdown – Vendetta (\"The World Behind\")\nIll Bill – The Hour of Reprisal (\"Babylon\")\nEvery Time I Die – Last Night in Town (\"Punch-Drunk Punk Rock Romance\")\nBeliever – Gabriel (\"The Brave\")\nAsking Alexandria – From Death to Destiny (\"Until the End\") *First guest appearance since leaving Killswitc\nCellar Darling are a three-piece Swiss progressive metal band from Winterthur and Lucerne, founded in 2016. The group was formed by Anna Murphy (vocals, hurdy-gurdy, flute), Merlin Sutter (drums) and Ivo Henzi (guitars and bass). Cellar Darling incorporates heavy metal, folk, classical, and progressive influences. Notably, the band uses a hurdy-gurdy and a transverse flute. The trio were previously part of the Swiss metal band Eluveitie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation ===\nIn May 2016 three longtime members of Eluveitie announced their departure from the band. Anna Murphy (singer and hurdy-gurdy player), Ivo Henzi (guitarist), and Merlin Sutter (drummer) parted ways with Eluveitie in a highly publicised split. The details of the split were not cited in the press, but speculation ensued among fans. In June 2016 the trio announced the creation of Cellar Darling. The band quickly began working on new music for their debut release.\nOn 23 September 2016 Cellar Darling launched a single called \"Challenge\" along with the B-side track \"Fire, Wind & Earth\". The single was self released and the video was created and directed by the band themselves. The musical style of the initial release was a concrete departure from the folk metal genre of their previous band. Cellar Darling played their first shows in December 2016, supporting Amorphis in Zurich, Switzerland and The Gentle Storm in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\n\n\n=== This Is The Sound and signing to Nuclear Blast ===\nIn January 2017 the trio announced their signing to German independent metal label Nuclear Blast Records, and that their debut album would be released through the label the following summer.\nIn May, it was announced that Cellar Darling's first album would be titled This Is the Sound and was to be released on 30 June 2017. A track list of the album was introduced.\nCellar Darling released their second single, \"Black Moon\", on 19 May 2017, along with a music video. This was followed on 17 June 2017 with a third single, \"Avalanche\".

The band's musical style evolved originally from black metal to a cleaner and more \"produced\" amalgam of gothic metal, symphonic metal and other metal genres. Their lyrical themes and imagery are heavily influenced by Gothic literature, poetry, mythology and horror films. The band consists of its founding member, vocalist Dani Filth, drummer Martin \"Marthus\" Škaroupka, bassist Daniel Firth, guitarists Marek \"Ashok\" Šmerda and Donny Burbage, and keyboardist Zoe Marie Federoff.\nThe band has broken free from its original niche by courting mainstream publicity. This increased accessibility has brought coverage from the likes of Kerrang! and MTV, along with frequent main stage appearances at major festivals such as Ozzfest, Download and even the mainstream Sziget Festival. They have sometimes been perceived as Satanic by casual observers, even though their outright lyrical references to Satanism are few and far between; their use of Satanic imagery has arguably always been more for shock value than any seriously held beliefs.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years (1991–1996) ===\n\nCradle of Filth's first three years saw three demos (Invoking the Unclean, Orgiastic Pleasures Foul and Total Fucking Darkness) recorded amidst the sort of rapid line-up fluctuations that have continued ever since, with the band having more than thirty musicians in its history. An album entitled Goetia was recorded prior to the third demo and set for release on Tombstone Records, but all tracks were wiped when Tombstone went out of business and the band could not afford to buy the recordings from the studio. The band eventually signed to Cacophonous Records, and their debut album, The Principle of Evil Made Flesh, was Cacophonous's first release in 1994. A step-up in terms of production from the rehearsal quality of most of their demos, the album was still nevertheless a sparse and embryonic version of what was to come, with lead singer Dani Filth's vocals in particular bearing little similarity to the style he was later to develop. The album was well-received however, and as recently as June 2006 found its way into Metal Hammer's list of the top ten black metal albums of the last twenty years.\nCradle's relationship with Cacophonous soon soured, the band accusing the label of contractual and financial mismanagement. Acrimonious legal proceedings took up most of 1995, and the original version of the band's second album, Dusk... and Her Embrace was recorded by the Principle... lineup for Cacophonous but scrapped. Subsequently re-worked with new band members for Music For Nations (see below), the embryonic Cacophonous version was eventually released as Dusk... and Her Embrace: The Original Sin in July 2016.\nThe band finally signed to Music for Nations in 1996 after only one more contractually obligated Cacophonous recording: the EP V Empire or Dark Faerytales in Phallustein, which, it has since been conceded, was hastily written as a Cacophonous escape-plan. Despite the circumstances of its release however, its handful of tracks are staples of the band's live sets to this day, and \"Queen of Winter, Throned\" was listed among twenty-five \"essential extreme metal anthems\" in a 2006 issue of Kerrang! magazine. The EP also marked Sarah Jezebel Deva's debut with the band, replacing Andrea Meyer, Cradle's first female vocalist and self-styled \"satanic advisor\". Deva appeared on every subsequent Cradle release and tour until 2010's Darkly, Darkly, Venus Aversa, but was never considered a full band member, since she also performed with The Kovenant, Therion and Mortiis, and fronted her own Angtoria project along with Cradle's former bass guitar player, Dave Pybus.\n\n\n=== Music for Nations era (1996–2001) ===\nThe re-worked and re-recorded Dusk... and Her Embrace followed the same year: a critically acclaimed breakthrough album that greatly expanded the band's fan-base throughout Europe and the rest\nDownset (usually stylized as downset.) is an American rap metal band from Los Angeles, California. Originally called Social Justice, the band's music blends influences from rap, funk, hardcore punk, and metal with \"socially aware lyrics.\"\n\n\n== Band history ==\n\n\n=== Formation and early releases (1989–1993) ===\nThe band's original moniker was Social Justice. They began as a hardcore punk band. They released their debut album, Unity Is Strength, in 1989 and the EP I Refuse to Lose under this name with a different lineup in 1992. They were known as being one of the first hardcore bands to incorporate hip hop and funk influences into their music.\nIn 1992, Social Justice changed their name to Downset, and released the Our Suffocation demo in 1993. The album, which explored various social issues such as the death of lead singer Rey Oropeza's father at the hands of the LAPD, was praised by critics. During this transition, they changed their sound by heavily incorporating rap metal and funk metal.\n\n\n=== Mercury Records, downset. and Do We Speak a Dead Language? (1994–1998) ===\n\nIn 1994, Downset signed a deal with Mercury Records, a subsidiary of PolyGram, and released their self-titled effort in the same year. In 1994, downset began gaining popularity in Europe after touring there with Biohazard and Dog Eat Dog, followed by a tour with Pantera and The Almighty later that year. In early 1995, Downset returned to Europe with Sullen for a massive headlining tour. In 1995, they also appeared at some major rock festivals throughout the continent including Roskilde and Dynamo. In 1996, the band released their most commercially successful album, Do We Speak a Dead Language?, through Mercury.\n\n\n=== Post-Mercury years, Check Your People and Universal (1998–2009) ===\nAfter making their departure from Mercury Records, Downset were scooped up by Epitaph Records and released their third album, Check Your People, in 2000. In 2004, Downset released their fourth album, Universal, on an independent record label Hawino Records. In recognition of the band's album release on Epitaph Records, \"Pure Trauma\", taken from the album Check Your People, was included on the 2001 multi-artist compilation Punk-O-Rama Vol. 6. The band disbanded in 2009.\n\n\n=== Reunion and One Blood (2013–2014) ===\nOn July 21, 2014, Downset's first new album in ten years, One Blood, was released worldwide.\n\n\n=== Signing to Nuclear Blast and Maintain (2022) ===\nAfter a period of prolonged inactivity, Downset announced in February 2022 that they had signed to Nuclear Blast Records, and announced plans for a new studio album as well as reissues of their demo singles \"Anger/Ritual\" and \"About Ta Blast\". On April 29, the band announced their new album, Maintain, would be released on June 10, 2022, and released the album's first single, \"The Place to Be\". The album sold 200 copies in its first week of sales.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThough Downset never experienced any mainstream success, and though its members came from an urban hardcore tradition rather than from metal, the band is still regarded as a noteworthy influence on the then-nascent nu metal and rap metal subgenres. In addition to headlining the second stage at Ozzfest in 1997, downset. toured with prominent bands such as Linkin Park, Pantera, Slayer, Metallica, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Korn, Snoop Dogg, Testament and Anthrax.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent\n\nNeil Roemer – vocals (2023–present)\nRogelio Lozano – guitar (1989–1994, 1999–2002, 2013, 2019–present)\nPhillip Gonzales – bass guitar (2019–present)\nBobby Blood – drums (2019–present)\nFormer members\n\nRey Oropeza – vocals (1989–2023)\nBrian \"Ares\" Schwager – guitar (1989–2016)\nChristopher \"Krasp\" Lee – drums (1989–1999, 2001–2005, 2013)\nChris Hamilton – drums (1999–2001, 2014–2019)\nJames Morris – bass guitar (1989–2003, 2014–2019)\nRico Villasenor – bass guitar (2003–2005)\nNeil Roemer – vocals (2013)\nJohnathan Manhart – bass guitar (2013)\nFormer touring musicians\n\nNeil Roemer – vocals (2013)\nJ\nThe discography of In Flames, a Swedish heavy metal band formed in the early 1990s, consists of fourteen studio albums, two live album, eight extended plays, thirty-one singles, two video albums, and forty-six music videos. Signed with Wrong Again Records, In Flames released their full-length debut, Lunar Strain (1994), followed by the EP Subterranean (1995). After signing to Nuclear Blast, they released The Jester Race (1996). The following year, they issued their second EP, Black-Ash Inheritance, and the full-length album Whoracle. The band's fourth studio album, Colony (1999), reached the top 30 in Sweden and Finland. Clayman followed in the same vein the next year, reaching the top 20 in the same countries. The tour to promote it was released as The Tokyo Showdown (2001) live album, which also charted in Sweden and Finland, breaking the top 40. Reroute to Remain (2002) peaked at number 5 on the Swedish and Finnish charts, and number 10 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart. The album was accompanied by the band's first single, \"Cloud Connected\", which failed to chart.\nIn 2003, In Flames released Trigger, an EP that features the title track backed with a remix, a cover of Genesis' \"Land of Confusion\", and two music videos. It was followed by Soundtrack to Your Escape in 2004, which peaked at number 3 in Sweden, and number 7 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart. The album produced a single for \"The Quiet Place\", which followed the success of the album and reached number 2 in their home country. Used & Abused: In Live We Trust (2005), was the band's debut video album, and their first release to top the Swedish chart. Following the same blueprint, Come Clarity (2006) topped the Finnish and Swedish charts, and reached number 2 on the Billboard Top Independent Albums, number 6 in Germany, as well as the top 30 in three additional European countries. The album was backed by the single \"Come Clarity\", which was released in a limited edition that reached number 52 in their home country. Before they released their ninth studio album, In Flames issued the single \"The Mirror's Truth\", which peaked at number 5 in Finland. Their ninth studio album, A Sense of Purpose (2008), topped the Swedish and Billboard Independent Albums charts, and reached top 10 in Austria, Finland, and Germany. In Flames were featured on Pendulum's 2010 album Immersion, on a song called \"Self vs Self\".

He is the sole founding member and chief ideologist of the black metal band Gorgoroth, formed in 1992, in addition to being the founder and head of Forces of Satan Records. While mainly a guitarist, Infernus has also participated as bassist, drummer and vocalist on several recordings released both by Gorgoroth and other bands.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== The formation of Gorgoroth ===\nInfernus founded the black metal band Gorgoroth in Sunnfjord in 1992 after allegedly making \"a pact with the Devil\". The first Gorgoroth demo, A Sorcery Written in Blood, was released in 1993, and led the band to acquiring a record deal with French label Embassy Productions. The first full-length Gorgoroth album, Pentagram, was released in 1994. In the following years, the band experienced several line-up changes, with Infernus being the sole original member to continue in the band. Joining members of black metal bands such as Ulver, Immortal, Enslaved, and Molested, Infernus participated as bassist on Borknagar's self-titled debut album, released in 1996. After signing a deal with German label Malicious Records, Gorgoroth released the albums Antichrist in 1996 and Under the Sign of Hell in1997, with Infernus writing all the music and the majority of the lyrics, in addition to performing both guitar and bass duties on the albums.\n\n\n=== Gorgoroth tenure with Nuclear Blast ===\nAfter the release of Under the Sign of Hell and a European headlining tour in 1997, Gorgoroth was signed by the major German metal label Nuclear Blast. In 1998, Infernus and Gorgoroth-guitarist Tormentor, who had joined the band in 1996, released an album as black metal side project called Desekrator, which also included members of Enslaved and Old Funeral. Infernus wrote the majority of the first two Gorgoroth albums released on Nuclear Blast, Destroyer (1998), and Incipit Satan (2000), while Tormentor, wrote the albums' title tracks. After performing live with Gorgoroth on several festivals and tours both in Europe and South America, Infernus became one of the founding members of the black metal band Orcustus in 2002, a band consisting of members and ex-members of Gorgoroth, Gehenna, and Enslaved. Twilight of the Idols - In Conspiracy with Satan, Gorgoroth's third release on Nuclear Blast, was released in 2003.\n\n\n=== Rape conviction ===\nIn 2003, Infernus was accused of repeatedly raping a woman for hours with a friend at an after-party in his apartment. He was initially sentenced to three years in prison in 2005, but appealed the sentence and was acquitted of rape but convicted of gross negligent rape and sentenced to one year in prison. He served four months in prison in the winter of 2006 and 2007 before being released on parole.\n\n\n=== Gorgoroth controversy in Kraków and transfer to Regain Records ===\nOn 1 February 2004, Infernus and Gorgoroth performed a live show in Kraków, meant to be released on a video album by Metal Mind Productions. Due to the satanic nature of the live show, which featured sheep heads on stakes, \"crucified\" nude models, satanic symbols and eighty litres of sheep's blood, the band and video producers were accused of breaking the Polish blasphemy laws. The tapes from the concert were confiscated by the Polish police for 4 years, but the concert was finally released on DVD in the summer of 2008 as Black Mass Krakow 2004. In 2005, Infernus and Tormentor, who had quit Gorgoroth in 2002, released a cover version of Von's \"Satanic Blood\" under the name Norwegian Evil. After leaving Nuclear Blast in 2004, Infernus and Gorgoroth signed on Swedish record label Regain Records, which released the next Gorgoroth album, Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam, in 2006.\n\n\n=== Forces of Satan Records ===\nOn 6 June 2006 Infernus started his own record label, Forces of Satan Records, dedicated to only releasing albums by bands with a \"clear-cut Satani\nDismember is a Swedish death metal band formed in 1988. They split up in 2011 but reunited in 2019. Pioneers of Swedish death metal, Dismember is now considered one of the country's \"big four\", alongside Entombed, Grave, and Unleashed.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and Nuclear Blast-era (1988–2002) ===\nThe band formed in Stockholm in 1988. After a hiatus, during which several members joined Carnage, the band began recording in earnest in 1991 and released their debut album Like an Ever Flowing Stream that year. The album is today heralded as a milestone for the burgeoning Swedish death metal scene and established the band's fanbase, which was further bolstered by the controversy surrounding one song in particular, \"Skin Her Alive\". The song prompted an obscenity charge in the United Kingdom, against which the band successfully defended themselves.\nIn 1992, Dismember released the Pieces EP, and the following year continued with second album, Indecent & Obscene, which featured their song \"Dreaming in Red\"; the \"Dreaming in Red\" videoclip was shown in MTV's Headbangers Ball. According to an interview with fellow Nuclear Blast group Benediction in metallian.com, Dismember and the said band got into a business dispute and eventually a fisticuff at this stage over tour arrangements and monies owed.\nLike many of the other Scandinavian death metal bands, Dismember began softening their sound in the mid-1990s, with 1995's Massive Killing Capacity having more melodic approaches, which had a good public response. Nevertheless, they attempted a return to style with 1997's Death Metal, which ultimately became a sales disappointment. Their last album for Nuclear Blast was 2000's Hate Campaign.\n\n\n=== Switching labels (2003–2006) ===\nAround 2003, Dismember set a new path and signed for Karmageddon Records. In 2004, they released their sole album with that label titled Where Ironcrosses Grow which some thought sounds close to Hate Campaign and was inspired by Iron Maiden and Autopsy.\nThey switched record companies again in 2005, signing to Regain Records, which bought the rights to their earlier albums as well and released them as luxury digipak editions. In 2006, Dismember released their seventh album The God That Never Was, which continued in the style of its predecessor. The band spent February on the road in Europe. In November 2006, Dismember toured Europe as part of the Masters of Death tour, with Grave, Unleashed, Entombed, and Exterminator.\n\n\n=== Split with Fred Estby and final album (2007–2010) ===\nAfter the release of The God That Never Was and some touring, Estby left the band \"after long and careful consideration\". In a posting on the official site on 20 April 2007, Estby cites the demands of touring and the needs of his family as key reasons for him leaving the band. His statements appears as \"My decision to put my family in first hand makes it impossible to keep on touring and commit to the band full time. I want to thank all the fans, friends, bands and all the other cool people I've met through the years and I wish Dismember all the best in the future. Fred.\"\nIn April 2008, they released their eighth album, Dismember.\nDismember released a two-disc DVD titled Under Blood Red Skies in late July 2009. The live concerts were filmed in the Netherlands and at the 2008 Party San Open Air Festival in Bad Berka, Germany. The DVD also included a documentary and interviews with band members. The cover art was created by Erik Danielsson of Trident Art.\n\n\n=== Breakup and reunion (2011–present) ===\nOn 16 October 2011, bassist Tobias Cristiansson revealed in a statement that Dismember had broken up: \"After 23 years, Dismember have now decided to quit. We wish to thank all our fans for your support.\"\nOn a possible reunion, drummer Fred Estby told Invisible Oranges in August 2016: \"People were telling me that all the time. So maybe we should try to do some shows and get everything back. We always owned our rights to the albums and shirts, but\nA nuclear holocaust, also known as a nuclear apocalypse, nuclear annihilation, nuclear armageddon, or atomic holocaust, is a theoretical scenario where the mass detonation of nuclear weapons causes widespread destruction and radioactive fallout. Such a scenario envisages large parts of the Earth becoming uninhabitable due to the effects of nuclear warfare, potentially causing the collapse of civilization, the extinction of humanity, and/or the termination of most biological life on Earth. \nBesides the immediate destruction of cities by nuclear blasts, the potential aftermath of a nuclear war could involve firestorms, a nuclear winter, widespread radiation sickness from fallout, and/or the temporary (if not permanent) loss of much modern technology due to electromagnetic pulses. Some scientists, such as Alan Robock, have speculated that a thermonuclear war could result in the end of modern civilization on Earth, in part due to a long-lasting nuclear winter. In one model, the average temperature of Earth following a full thermonuclear war falls for several years by 7 – 8 °C (13 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit) on average.\nEarly Cold War-era studies suggested that billions of humans would survive the immediate effects of nuclear blasts and radiation following a global thermonuclear war. The International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War believe that nuclear war could indirectly contribute to human extinction via secondary effects, including environmental consequences, societal breakdown, and economic collapse.\nThe threat of a nuclear holocaust plays an important role in the anti-nuclear movement and the development of popular perception of nuclear weapons. It features in the security concept of mutually assured destruction (MAD) and is a common scenario in survivalism. Nuclear holocaust is a common feature in literature and film, especially in speculative genres such as science fiction, dystopian and post-apocalyptic fiction.\n\n\n== Etymology and usage ==\nThe English word \"holocaust\", derived from the Greek term \"holokaustos\" meaning \"completely burnt\", refers to great destruction and loss of life, especially by fire.\nOne early use of the word \"holocaust\" to describe an imagined nuclear destruction appears in Reginald Glossop's 1926 novel The Orphan of Space: \"Moscow ... beneath them  ... a crash like a crack of Doom! The echoes of this Holocaust rumbled and rolled ... a distinct smell of sulphur ... atomic destruction.\" In the novel, an atomic weapon is planted in the office of the Soviet dictator, who, with German help and Chinese mercenaries, is preparing the takeover of Western Europe.\n\n\n== Likelihood of nuclear war ==\n\nAs of 2021, humanity has about 13,410 nuclear weapons, thousands of which are on hair-trigger alert. While stockpiles have been on the decline following the end of the Cold War, every nuclear country is currently undergoing modernization of its nuclear arsenal. The Bulletin advanced their symbolic Doomsday Clock in 2015, citing among other factors \"a nuclear arms race resulting from modernization of huge arsenals\". In January 2020, it was moved forward to 100 seconds before midnight. In 2023, it was moved forward to 90 seconds before midnight.\nJohn F. Kennedy estimated the probability of the Cuban Missile Crisis escalating to nuclear conflict as between 33% and 50%.\nIn a poll of experts at the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference in Oxford (17–20 July 2008), the Future of Humanity Institute estimated the probability of complete human extinction by nuclear weapons at 1% within the century, the probability of 1 billion dead at 10% and the probability of 1 million dead at 30%. These results reflect the median opinions of a group of experts, rather than a probabilistic model; the actual values may be much lower or higher.\nScientists have argued that even a small-scale nuclear war between two countries, such as India and Pakistan, could have devastating global consequences and such local conflicts are more likely\nBurning Witches is a Swiss heavy/power metal band, founded by rhythm guitarist Romana Kalkuhl, based in Brugg, Aargau.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and self-titled debut ===\nRomana Kalkuhl, guitarist with Atlas & Axis, had been looking for a cast for an all-female metal band for a long time. Over the years, she got to know different musicians and finally found the first cast with bassist Jeanine Grob, drummer Lala Frischknecht and lead singer Seraina Telli. In 2016, guitarist Alea Wyss completed the lineup. First came a self-titled single, which was also the band's first demo. This was voted \"Demo of the Month\" in both Rock Hard and Metal Hammer.\nIn 2017, Burning Witches released their self-titled debut album in-house, directed by V.O. Pulver (Poltergeist, Gurd) and Marcel \"Schmier\" Schirmer (Destruction). The album was distributed through the crowdfunding platform Pledge Music. With the song Jawbreaker, the album contains a cover version of a song by Judas Priest. The album reached number 73 in the Swiss album charts. Shortly after the release, Burning Witches began songwriting for their next album. On 14 February 2018, Nuclear Blast announced they had signed the band.\n\n\n=== Hexenhammer and Dance with the Devil ===\nIn the meantime, Wyss was replaced by Sonia 'Anubis' Nusselder from the Netherlands. A tour as the opening act for Grave Digger followed. A first album trailer was released on 12 September 2018. Three digital singles followed. The album Hexenhammer was released on 9 November 2018. It is not a concept album in the strict sense, although the book of the same name plays a role in some songs. With Holy Diver by the band Dio there is again a cover version on the album. The album reached number 43 in the German album charts and number 21 in Switzerland. In June 2019, singer Seraina Telli left the band to focus on her own band, Dead Venus. She was succeeded by Dutch singer Laura Guldemond from the band Shadowrise. \nIn the Summer of 2019, Burning Witches played at the Wacken, Summer Breeze and Rockharz Open Air festivals. The album Dance with the Devil, produced by Pulver and Schirmer, was released on 6 March 2020. The album features a cover version of the Manowar song Battle Hymn, which features guest musicians Ross the Boss and Michael Lepond. Dance with the Devil entered the German and Swiss album charts at number 22 and 14 respectively. A few months later, Nusselder left the band after founding the death metal band Crypta with former Nervosa musicians Fernanda Lira and Luana Dametto. Larissa Ernst then took over as lead guitarist.\n\n\n=== The Witch of the North ===\nOn 4 December, the band released The Circle of Five EP before recording their fourth studio album, The Witch of the North. The album was again produced by Schirmer and mixed and mastered by V.O. Powder. The album was released on 28 May 2021. The album entered the German and Swiss album charts at number 16 and 6 respectively. In February 2022, the band signed a new record deal with the Austrian record label Napalm Records. Their first tour of the United States with The Iron Maidens occurred in 2022.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nBurning Witches is mainly influenced by the heavy metal of the 1980s, while the musicians also listen to other music. Among other things, Sonia 'Anubis' Nusselder also played in the death metal band Sephiroth. Nusselder is currently the lead guitarist of the band Cobra Spell . Musically, the band is reminiscent of Iron Maiden, Alice Cooper and Judas Priest.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\tBurning Witches, current lineup live at Rock & Metal Day'z 2024 at Motorsport Arena Oschersleben\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n2018: Burning Alive (Live-EP, Self-produced)\n2019: Wings of Steel (12\"-EP, Nuclear Blast)\n2020: The Circle of Five (EP, Nuclear Blast)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n2016: Burning Witches (Demo 2016, Self-produced)\n2018: Hexenhammer (Nuclear Bl\nFit for an Autopsy is an American deathcore band from Jersey City, New Jersey, formed in 2008.

Fellow rock musician Liselotte Hegt wrote that \"Zora is almost like a siren, luring you into dark romantic scenarios, twisted fairy tales and ghostlike sceneries\", and found that the orchestral elements on the album were present but not overpowering.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent line-up\nZora Cock – vocals (2012–present)\nRené Boxem – drums (2012–present)\nBart Winters – lead guitar (2012–present)\nRobin Koezen – rhythm guitar (2016–present)\nRuben Wijga – keyboards (2019–present)\nSiebe Sol Sijpkens – bass (2022–present, live 2021)\nPrevious members\nRené Sempel – rhythm guitar (2012–2016)\nFrank Akkerman – bass (2012–2022)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nThe Cause of Shipwreck (2021)\nA Dark Euphony (2023)\nEPs\n\nFractured Fairytales (2017)\nWe'd Rather Burn (2018)\nOur Mortal Remains(2019)\nSingles\n\n\"Ready to Kill\" (2014)\n\"Until Eternity\" (2015)\n\"Preserved Roses\" (2017)\n\"Snow White and Rose Red\" (2019; featuring Ulli Perhonen)\n\"Mortal Remains\" (2019)\n\"The Séance\" (2021)\n\"Deadly Diminuendo\" (2021)\n\"Selkie\" (2021)\n\"Walking Over My Grave\" (2021)\n\"Fairy of the Bog\" (2021)\n\"Crimson Faces\" (2022)\n\"My Soul's Demise\" (2023)\n\"Cicada\" (2023)\n\"Forever and a Day\" (2023)\n\"Spirit of Forgetfulness\" (2023)\n\"Moonflower\" (2024; featuring Marjana Semkina)\n\n\n== Videography ==\n\"Ready to Kill\" Directed by Michel Berendsen\n\"Until Eternity\" Directed by Joshua Maldonado\n\"I'd Rather Burn\" Directed by Blackbriar\n\"Arms of the Ocean\" Directed by Joshua Maldonado\n\"Snow White and Rose Red\"\n\"Mortal Remains\"\n\"Beautiful Delirium\"\n\"The Séance\" Directed by Joshua Maldonado\n\"Selkie\"\n\"Walking Over My Grave\" Directed by Joshua Maldonado\n\"Weakness and Lust\" Directed by Blackbriar\n\"You're Haunting Me\"\n\"Fairy of the Bog\" Directed by Joshua Maldonado\n\"Crimson Faces\" Directed by Joshua Maldonado\n\"My Soul's Demise\" Directed by Joshua Maldonado\n\"Cicada\" Directed by Blackbriar\n\"Spirit of Forgetfulness\" Directed by blksm media\n\"Moonflower (feat.

Formed in Solingen in 1976, Accept originally consisted of lead vocalist Udo Dirkschneider, lead guitarist Wolf Hoffmann, rhythm guitarist Gerard Wahl (later replaced by Jörg Fischer), bassist Peter Baltes and drummer Frank Friedrich. The band signed to Brain Records and released their self-titled debut album in 1979, which failed to chart. After Friedrich was replaced by Stefan Kaufmann, I'm a Rebel, Breaker and Restless and Wild (the group's first release after Fischer's departure) followed over the next three years, the last of which gave Accept their debut on the UK Albums Chart when it reached number 98.\nThe band signed with RCA Records and released Balls to the Wall in 1983, their first album with Fischer's replacement Herman Frank. It was the band's first domestic success, registering at number 59 on the German Albums Chart. The album also charted in the United States and Canada, receiving gold certifications in both regions. With Fischer later returning, the band's commercial recognition increased with their next two releases, as Metal Heart and Russian Roulette gave Accept their first German top 20 and top 10 chart positions, respectively. Dirkschneider was fired in 1987, but the band (with David Reece and without Fischer again) returned in 1989 with Eat the Heat, which peaked at number 15 in Germany. After a final touring cycle, Accept broke up in late 1989.\nReuniting with Dirkschneider, Accept returned in 1992 to record their comeback album Objection Overruled. Released the following year, it reached number 17 on the German Albums Chart. The group's popularity began to reduce in the 1990s, however, as 1994's Death Row peaked at number 32 and 1996's Predator peaked at number 56. Again, the band broke up in 1997. After a brief touring cycle in 2005, Accept reformed in 2009 with Hoffmann, Baltes, Frank joined by returning drummer Stefan Schwarzmann and new vocalist Mark Tornillo. Signed to Nuclear Blast, the band peaked at number 4 with 2010's Blood of the Nations and number 6 with 2012's Stalingrad: Brothers in Death, before achieving their first German Albums Chart number one with Blind Rage, released in 2014.\nAccept parted ways with Frank and Schwarzmann in 2014, with their places taken in April 2015 by Uwe Lulis and Christopher Williams, respectively. In 2017 the band reached number 9 in Germany with the live album Restless and Live: Blind Rage Live in Europe 2015, before issuing The Rise of Chaos later in the year and reaching the top three. Another live release, Symphonic Terror: Live at Wacken 2017, also reached the German Albums Chart top 20 in 2018.\n\n\n== Albums ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\n\n\n== Singles ==\n\n\n== Videos ==\n\n\n=== Video albums ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAccept official website\nMeshuggah is a Swedish extreme metal band formed in 1987 in Umeå.

In 2002 the band released their next album, Nothing.

Meshuggah released I in 2004, a single 21-minute track, and in 2005 the band released the next full-length album, Catch Thirtythree, a 47-minute song divided up into 13 movements, the only album with programmed drums.

This latter release saw significant critical acclaim within the relevant specialist press, with Rich Webb of Distorted Sound magazine describing it as \"simply incredible\" and Dave Knowles of Metal Temple calling it an \"instant classic\".\nThey then signed with Finnish doom metal specialist label Svart Records in 2020. Vocalist Tom Templar said at interview that the band chose Svart over an unidentified larger label, calling them the \"last bastion of music industry good\". In 2021 the band played at Bloodstock festival, before releasing the album Black Harvest in October of that year. This release again received positive reviews, this time from larger publications including Kerrang!.\nThe band signed with Nuclear Blast Records in July 2022, before playing a set at Damnation Festival in November, again to positive coverage including from Kerrang!\nThey supported Clutch in an international tour in late 2022.\n\n\n== Influences and musical style ==\nGreen Lung's musical style has been described as drawing heavily from British classic rock and early heavy metal, with Queen, Deep Purple and especially Black Sabbath's 1970s material cited as audible influences by reviewers.\nThe band's lyrical and visual theming are influenced by 1960s and 70s folk horror films and also by British folklore such as the Green Man and the Pendle witches.\nThe band works with English graphic designer and illustrator Richard Wells, who has designed the covers and vinyl inserts for their albums and their EP, as well as merchandise and stage backdrops. The art produced in his work with Green Lung is inspired by Well's own linocut art style and evokes the same folklore and horror themes as their lyrics.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nWoodland Rites (2019)\nBlack Harvest (2021)\nThis Heathen Land (2023)\nEP\n\nFree the Witch (2018)\nDemo\n\nGreen Man Rising (2017)\nSingles\n\n\"Lady Lucifer\" (2018)\n\"Let the Devil In\" (2019)\n\"Leaders of the Blind\" (2021)\n\"Reaper's Scythe\" (2021)\n\"Graveyard Sun\" (2021)\n\"Upon the Altar\" (2021)\n\"Mountain Throne\" (2023)\n\"Maxine (Witch Queen)\" (2023)\n\"One for Sorrow\" (2023)\n\n\n== References ==\nVenom Inc. are a British heavy metal band from Newcastle upon Tyne. Formed in 2015, the band features former Venom members Jeffrey \"Mantas\" Dunn, Tony \"Demolition Man\" Dolan and previously Anthony \"Abaddon\" Bray. Bray was replaced by Jeramie \"War Machine\" Kling in 2018, who was replaced by Marc \"JXN\" Jackson in 2024. The group has released two studio albums.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of Venom Inc. goes back to April 2015, when the band Mpire of Evil (with former Venom members Jeffrey Dunn and Tony Dolan) played at Keep It True festival in Germany. At the gig, Dunn and Dolan invited drummer Anthony \"Abaddon\" Bray, another former Venom member, to play a few old Venom songs at the festival, although Dunn and Bray had not spoken to each other for around 20 years. This spontaneous action led to the formation of Venom Inc., which consisted of the Venom line-up from 1989 to 1992:  Dunn as guitarist, Dolan as singer and bassist and Bray as drummer. \nThe group's debut album, Avé, was released in August 2017 by Nuclear Blast. \"Dein Fleisch\" and \"Ave Satanas\" were released as singles. In the same year, the band performed at MetalDays, among others. At the end of April 2018, Dunn suffered a heart attack, which resulted in a brief cardiac arrest. He underwent double bypass surgery and has since recovered. The band later revealed that Bray did not actually play drums on Avé and that they used a drum machine instead.\nBray took a break from band activities in early 2018 due to the birth of his daughter. However, in September 2018, he announced that he would not be returning to the band. During his break, he had learned that he had been fired and Jeramie Kling would now be the band's new drummer.\nThe band released their second studio album, There's Only Black, in September 2022. \nIn November 2023, Kling parted ways with the band due to \"logistical reasons\". He was replaced by Marc \"JXN\" Jackson in April 2024, previously of associated act Mpire of Evil.\nIn April 2024, Jeffrey Dunn suffered a second heart attack and is in recovery. Stepping in for tour duties is ex-Annihilator, ex-Nevermore and current 72 Legions guitar player Curran \"Beleth\" Murphy.  \n\n\n== Musical style ==\nIn a 2017 Rock Hard interview, Tony Dolan stated that Venom Inc. was more than just a cover band, and that they want to experiment and surprise with songs like \"Dein Fleisch\". In the same issue, Thomas Kupfer reviewed Avé, stating that the album is not for \"music snobs\", but offers \"rowdy noise orgies\". Stephan Möller from Metal.de also reviewed the album and stated that it can be categorised somewhere between the first wave of black metal as well as speed metal and thrash metal. This brought the term \"black 'n' roll\" and a Motörhead comparison to his mind. Compared to the Venom albums Black Metal and Welcome to Hell, Venom Inc. sounds a little \"rockier\" and more like Motörhead. The music also has a more modern feel. Avé is \"mature and probably the cleanest album that this constellation of musicians has ever recorded\". \n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nJeffrey \"Mantas\" Dunn – guitars, backing vocals (2015–present)\nTony \"Demolition Man\" Dolan – bass, lead vocals (2015–present)\nMarc \"JXN\" Jackson – drums (2024–present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nAnthony \"Abaddon\" Bray – drums (2015–2018)\nJeramie \"War Machine\" Kling – drums (2018–2023)\n\n\n=== Touring members ===\nNick Barker – drums (2022)\nMike \"Mykvs\" Hickey – guitars (2023)\nCurran \"Beleth\" Murphy – guitars (2024–present)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n2017: Avé (Nuclear Blast)\n2022: There's Only Black (Nuclear Blast)\nSingles\n2017: \"Dein Fleisch\" (Decibel Flexi Series)\n2018: \"War\" (Nuclear Blast)\n2022: \"How Many Can Die\" (Nuclear Blast)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \nVenom Inc. at AllMusic \nVenom Inc. discography at Discogs\nThe following is the complete discography of the German thrash metal band Kreator.\n\n\n== Albums ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n\n\n=== Video albums ===\n\n\n== EPs ==\n\n\n== Singles ==\n\n\n== Music videos ==\n\n\n== References ==\nGorgoroth is a Norwegian black metal band based in Bergen. It was formed in 1992 by guitarist Infernus, who is the sole original member remaining, and has released nine studio albums. Gorgoroth are a Satanic band and have drawn controversy due to some of their concerts, which have featured impaled sheep heads and mock crucifixions. The band is named after the dead plateau of darkness in the land of Mordor from J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years (1992–1995) ===\n\nGorgoroth was founded in 1992 by guitarist Infernus. In 1993, the band released their first demo, entitled A Sorcery Written in Blood. On 7 January 1994, Firda, the major newspaper in the county of Sogn og Fjordane where the band originated from, ran a cover story on the demo, with the headline \"Local music with Satanic symbolism\". According to the article, the release of the demo and flyers with Satanic symbols led to \"concerned parents contacting the Sheriff's Office in Fjaler\". After the demo was released, Gorgoroth signed a record deal with Embassy Productions and started work on their debut full-length Pentagram. When bassist Kjettar left the band in 1993, Samoth of Emperor joined Gorgoroth as their new bassist, and participated in the recording of the album. After Pentagram was completed and released in 1994, drummer Goat left the band and was replaced by Frost from Satyricon. The band performed their first concert at Lusa Lottes Pøbb in Oslo on 3 May 1994 at a four-day Black Metal Nights festival with bands such as Dark Funeral (who also made their live debut), Dissection, Enslaved, Marduk (who played their first gig abroad), Gehenna and Hades Almighty.\nThis was followed by gigs with Enslaved in Bergen (in June and September) and in Haugesund (in November), and the band performed their first gig abroad in Annaberg-Buchholz in Germany on 10 December 1994. The same year, the band commenced the recording of Antichrist (originally titled Død), their second full-length album.\n\n\n=== With Pest (1995–1997) ===\n\nVocalist Hat decided to leave Gorgoroth in September 1995, but agreed to finish recording the vocal tracks for Antichrist. After Hat left, Infernus recruited vocalist Pest from Obtained Enslavement as Gorgoroth's new vocalist. In December 1995, the band supported Cradle of Filth at the London Astoria, a show which also included the band Primordial. This marked the first Gorgoroth live appearance of both vocalist Pest and bassist Ares. In 1995 the band had been offered a record deal with Moonfog Productions, but this offer was rejected in favour of an offer made by German label Malicious Records. Malicious Records released the band's second album, Antichrist, in 1996, and also re-released the debut album Pentagram. The band went on a European tour with Satyricon and Dissection in April 1996, followed by a one-off gig in Bergen with Hades Almighty and Gehenna, at which the live EP The Last Tormentor was recorded. The band also played a one-off gig in the fall in Bischofswerda, Germany, with Behemoth. Soon the name Gorgoroth was commonplace in the black metal underground, both in Norway and in the rest of Europe, if somewhat overshadowed by some of the more famous black metal bands such as Mayhem or Emperor. The band's third full-length album, Under the Sign of Hell, was recorded in spring 1996, and guitarist Tormentor joined the band later in the year. Under the Sign of Hell was released in 1997, and Gorgoroth went on their first headlining European tour in fall 1997, with support by Mystic Circle. It was on this tour that Infernus and Tormentor were approached by the major German heavy metal record label Nuclear Blast, who wanted to sign the band. The band accepted the offer in late 1997.\n\n\n=== Tenure with Nuclear Blast (1997–2003) ===\nThe move to Nuclear Blast was controversial among many black metal enthusiasts who pertained to the tenets of an 'underground black metal scene'.

He is known for playing for metal bands Wintersun, Imperanon, Induction, Smackbound, and Megadeth. \n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 2004, he joined the band Wintersun and has toured with them since then. He also played for Imperanon until their break-up in 2007. He has written many unreleased songs with Imperanon.\nHe has also played for Smackbound since 2015.\nOn 5 September 2023, Mäntysaari stepped in as lead guitarist on Megadeth's North American tour as regular guitarist Kiko Loureiro tended to undisclosed family matters. He was appointed on Loureiro's recommendation. \nOn 21 November 2023, Megadeth band leader Dave Mustaine released an official statement, announcing that the band is \"going to move forward with Teemu Mäntysaari as the guitar player for Megadeth\" while Loureiro stays on an indefinite hiatus. This became permanent as Loureiro announced his departure from Megadeth later that month.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Related links ==\nWintersun's page on the Nuclear Blast website\nImperanon at Myspace",

The driving reaction may be nuclear fission or nuclear fusion or a multi-stage cascading combination of the two, though to date all fusion-based weapons have used a fission device to initiate fusion, and a pure fusion weapon remains a hypothetical device. Nuclear explosions are used in nuclear weapons and nuclear testing."

They are often associated with mushroom clouds, since any large atmospheric explosion can create such a cloud. Nuclear explosions produce high levels of ionizing radiation and radioactive debris that is harmful to humans and can cause moderate to severe skin burns, eye damage, radiation sickness, radiation-induced cancer and possible death depending on how far a person is from the blast radius. Nuclear explosions can also have detrimental effects on the climate, lasting from months to years. A small-scale nuclear war could release enough particles into the atmosphere to cause the planet to cool and cause crops, animals, and agriculture to disappear across the globe—an effect named nuclear winter."

The event involved the full-scale testing of an implosion-type fission atomic bomb. In a memorandum to the U.S. Secretary of War, General Leslie Groves describes the yield as equivalent to 15,000 to 20,000 tons of TNT. Following this test, a uranium-gun type nuclear bomb (Little Boy) was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, with a blast yield of 15 kilotons; and a plutonium implosion-type bomb (Fat Man) on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945, with a blast yield of 21 kilotons.

This causes vaporization of the surrounding material, resulting in its rapid expansion. Kinetic energy created by this expansion contributes to the formation of a shock wave which expands spherically from the center. Intense thermal radiation at the hypocenter forms a nuclear fireball which, if the explosion is low enough in altitude, is often associated with a mushroom cloud.

While frame buildings collapse from as little as 3 psi (20 kPa) of overpressure, blast shelters are regularly constructed to survive several hundred psi. This substantially decreases the likelihood that a bomb can harm the structure.\nThe basic plan is to provide a structure that is very strong in compression. The actual strength specification must be done individually, based on the nature and probability of the threat. A typical specification for heavy civil defence shelter in Europe during the Cold war was an overhead explosion of a 500 kiloton weapon at the height of 500 meters. Such a weapon would be used to attack soft targets (factories, administrative centres, communications) in the area."

However, in the countryside or in a suburb, the likely distance to the explosion is much larger, as it is improbable that anyone would waste an expensive nuclear device on such targets. The most common purpose-built structure is a steel-reinforced concrete vault or arch buried or located in the basement of a house.\nMost expedient blast shelters are civil engineering structures that contain large buried tubes or pipes such as sewage or rapid transit tunnels. Even these, nonetheless, require several additions to serve properly: blast doors, air-filtration and ventilation equipment, secondary exits, and air-proofing."

To form these, a narrow (1-2 metre-wide) flexible tent of thin wood is placed in a deep trench (usually the apex of the tent is below grade), and then covered with cloth or plastic, and then covered with 1–2 meters of tamped earth. Shelters of this type are approved field expedient blast shelters of both the U.S. and China. Entrances are constructed from thick wooden frames. Blast valves are to be constructed from tire-treads laid on thick wooden grids.\nNuclear bunkers must also cope with the underpressure that lasts for several seconds after the shock wave passes, and prompt radiation. The overburden and structure provide substantial radiation shielding, and the negative pressure is usually only 1/3 of the overpressure."

The first full-length Gorgoroth album, Pentagram, was released in 1994. In the following years, the band experienced several line-up changes, with Infernus being the sole original member to continue in the band. Joining members of black metal bands such as Ulver, Immortal, Enslaved, and Molested, Infernus participated as bassist on Borknagar's self-titled debut album, released in 1996.

In the same issue, Thomas Kupfer reviewed Avé, stating that the album is not for \"music snobs\", but offers \"rowdy noise orgies\". Stephan Möller from Metal.de also reviewed the album and stated that it can be categorised somewhere between the first wave of black metal as well as speed metal and thrash metal. This brought the term \"black 'n' roll\" and a Motörhead comparison to his mind. Compared to the Venom albums Black Metal and Welcome to Hell, Venom Inc. sounds a little \"rockier\" and more like Motörhead. The music also has a more modern feel. Avé is \"mature and probably the cleanest album that this constellation of musicians has ever recorded\". \n\n\n== Members =="

After the demo was released, Gorgoroth signed a record deal with Embassy Productions and started work on their debut full-length Pentagram. When bassist Kjettar left the band in 1993, Samoth of Emperor joined Gorgoroth as their new bassist, and participated in the recording of the album.
