Some of the members originated from other bands such as Green Carnation, Carpathian Forest, Trail of Tears, Dismal Euphony and In the Woods. In 2004, the Forthcoming Addiction demo, containing four songs, was recorded at DUB studio. The band signed a two album record deal with Sound Riot Records in September 2004, but due to the touring of some members with their other bands at the beginning the year, the production of The Masquerade was not finished until March 2005. In July 2005 the German label Massacre Records became interested in the band, and Sound Riot Records licensed the Chain Collector album to them. Massacre Records released The Masquerade in Europe, Canada, and Australia in November 2005, while Sound Riot Records released their edition in December 2005. The band parted ways with Sound Riot and released the second album, Unrestrained in 2007.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nGøran Bomann - guitar\nSvenn Aksel Henriksen - vocals\nAnders Kobro - drums\nMartin Eltvik - bass\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nKjetil Nordhus - vocals\nKjell Jacobsen - guitar\nRunar Hansen - guitar\n\n\n== Session members ==\nHanne Kolstø - vocals\nEndre Kirkesola - bass, keyboards\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe Masquerade (2005)\nUnrestrained (2008)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChain Collector's official website\nChain Collector at Encyclopaedia Metallum\nWaldemar Sorychta (born 30 October 1967) is a Polish heavy metal record producer and musician who has lived in Germany since 1982.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHe initially worked with German thrash metal band Despair, founded in 1986.\nIn 1994 he took part in the recording of the album Jesus Killing Machine by supergroup Voodoocult, led by German rock singer Phillip Boa featuring former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo among others.

B. Yeats that was published in The Rose in 1893. The poem is one of many early Yeatsian lyrical poems which use the symbol of the rose. The poem consists of twelve rhyming couplets in iambic pentameter.\n\n\n== Text ==\n\n\n== Commentary and Interpretation ==\n\nThe symbol of the rose in \"To the Rose upon the Rood of Time\" is firstly one that is constant, binding past and present through its spiritual and romantic referents. Stephen Coote notes that the rose on the rood was a symbol worn around the neck of those belonging to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn: the \"female\" rose is impaled upon the \"male\" cross. The union of these two elements was intended to help the wearer transcend beyond the physical and into the spiritual: \"the rose could also be seen as intellectual, spiritual and eternal beauty impaled upon the world and suffering with mankind as transcendence becomes immanence.\"\nAs a symbol of constancy, the rose is also the symbol of Yeats's undying love for Maud Gonne, as well as the symbol for Ireland herself as a homeland, suffering and dying on the cross, beautiful, tragic, hoping for resurrection. Although Ireland suffers, she remains eternally beautiful, an unchanging factor that transcends time. Whatever the referent, or referents, the permanence of the rose is clear, as it is the \"Red Rose, proud Rose, sad Rose of all my days\" (line 1). In order for Yeats to tell of the great Celtic heroes, the rose must come near, presumably because the rose has witnessed and embodied the sufferings of the people long past (line 2).\nFurthermore, the rose is invited to: \"Come near, that no more blinded by man’s fate,/ I find under the boughs of love and hate,/ In all poor foolish things that live a day,/ Eternal beauty wandering on her way\" (lines 9-12). \"Eternal beauty\" is the rose, personified at the end of the stanza, or at the very least made female; however, the word \"eternal\" is the word to note. The rose always was, and is, and will be forever on the \"Rood of Time.\nThe poem is settled in the rose, to the point that the poem’s tone is one of sweet, suffering melancholy, a tone that is reaching for the sublime. In the 1890s, says Stephen Coote, Yeats was concerned for the \"spiritual regeneration of his people\": he felt that a spiritual posture of awe, a posture taken before those things that were excellent, beautiful, and full of grandeur, was necessary to achieve that regeneration. The Oxford Dictionary notes that the etymology of \"sublime\" renders a Latin root, sublimus, meaning \"below the threshold\". The sublime, then, is that which is so beautiful it borders on the spiritual or the divine: Yeats poses the rose as a starting point for spiritual regeneration, and surrounds this symbol with the beautiful lyricism, euphony, rhyme and meter which characterizes his early poetry.\nThe repeated phrase \"come near\" has the feel of an incantation: the rose's proximity, so close, and yet leaving a space large enough for \"the rose-breath to fill\", contributes to the feeling of being on the verge of the divine (line 14). The lack of complete and utter communion with the rose gives the poem an air of sweet suffering that seems necessary in order to achieve the sublime.\nThe suffering in the \"sad Rose\", however, also lends an anxiety to the poem's melancholy, an anxiety that is supported by the allusions to the Irish heroes, buried interminably in Irish ground and in Irish memory. The Druid, a priest, magician and soothsayer of the ancient Celtic religion, long an extinct specimen of Ireland, is here described with romantic and wonderful qualities: \"wood-nurtured, quiet-eyed\" (line 4). Yeats mourns the lack of the good in occult religion of the past; furthermore, the mention of Cuchulain and Fergus recalls their tragic ends.\nCuchulain was a mythological hero with an Achilles-like story, an unbeatable warrior defeated because of a small weakness. He was betrayed by his enemies and died at the ",

In July 2005 the German label Massacre Records became interested in the band, and Sound Riot Records licensed the Chain Collector album to them. Massacre Records released The Masquerade in Europe, Canada, and Australia in November 2005, while Sound Riot Records released their edition in December 2005.

Stephen Coote notes that the rose on the rood was a symbol worn around the neck of those belonging to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn: the \"female\" rose is impaled upon the \"male\" cross. The union of these two elements was intended to help the wearer transcend beyond the physical and into the spiritual: \"the rose could also be seen as intellectual, spiritual and eternal beauty impaled upon the world and suffering with mankind as transcendence becomes immanence.\""

                "content": "As a symbol of constancy, the rose is also the symbol of Yeats's undying love for Maud Gonne, as well as the symbol for Ireland herself as a homeland, suffering and dying on the cross, beautiful, tragic, hoping for resurrection. Although Ireland suffers, she remains eternally beautiful, an unchanging factor that transcends time. Whatever the referent, or referents, the permanence of the rose is clear, as it is the \"Red Rose, proud Rose, sad Rose of all my days\" (line 1). In order for Yeats to tell of the great Celtic heroes, the rose must come near, presumably because the rose has witnessed and embodied the sufferings of the people long past (line 2)."

The rose always was, and is, and will be forever on the \"Rood of Time."

                "content": "The poem is settled in the rose, to the point that the poem’s tone is one of sweet, suffering melancholy, a tone that is reaching for the sublime. In the 1890s, says Stephen Coote, Yeats was concerned for the \"spiritual regeneration of his people\": he felt that a spiritual posture of awe, a posture taken before those things that were excellent, beautiful, and full of grandeur, was necessary to achieve that regeneration. The Oxford Dictionary notes that the etymology of \"sublime\" renders a Latin root, sublimus, meaning \"below the threshold\". The sublime, then, is that which is so beautiful it borders on the spiritual or the divine: Yeats poses the rose as a starting point for spiritual regeneration, and surrounds this symbol with the beautiful lyricism, euphony, rhyme and meter which characterizes his early poetry."

                "content": "The repeated phrase \"come near\" has the feel of an incantation: the rose's proximity, so close, and yet leaving a space large enough for \"the rose-breath to fill\", contributes to the feeling of being on the verge of the divine (line 14). The lack of complete and utter communion with the rose gives the poem an air of sweet suffering that seems necessary in order to achieve the sublime.\nThe suffering in the \"sad Rose\", however, also lends an anxiety to the poem's melancholy, an anxiety that is supported by the allusions to the Irish heroes, buried interminably in Irish ground and in Irish memory. The Druid, a priest, magician and soothsayer of the ancient Celtic religion, long an extinct specimen of Ireland, is here described with romantic and wonderful qualities: \"wood-nurtured, quiet-eyed\" (line 4). Yeats mourns the lack of the good in occult religion of the past; furthermore, the mention of Cuchulain and Fergus recalls their tragic ends."
