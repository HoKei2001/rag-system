While making an attempt, he is summoned by a novice for an emergency, that of an overweight woman possessed by a demon. Father Maurice performs the rite of exorcism, expelling the demon from the woman.\nThe demon, an escaped little devil named Giuditta, not wanting to return whence he came, starts following Father Maurice everywhere and often indulges in mischief, sometimes innocently getting Father Maurice into trouble. Father Maurice fails several times to get rid of Giuditta, who, in one instance, replaces an ill Father Maurice at Mass, turning the solemn ceremony into a fashion parade. Seeing that he is showing signs of exhaustion, Father Maurice's peers advise him to take a vacation. Eventually, another agent \"from the same place as Giuditta\" appears and manages to attract Giuditta, who finally leaves Maurice and follows her \"elsewhere\".\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRoberto Benigni as Giuditta, the little devil\nWalter Matthau as Father Maurice\nNicoletta Braschi as Nina\nStefania Sandrelli as Patrizia\nJohn Lurie as Cusatelli\nPaolo Baroni as Saverio\nFranco Fabrizi as Priest\nAnnabella Schiavone as Giuditta, the woman\n\n\n== Awards ==\nRoberto Benigni won the David di Donatello Award for Best Actor.\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Little Devil at IMDb\nThe Little Devil at Rotten Tomatoes\nThe Little Devil at AllMovie\nThe Little Devil at Variety Distribution\nLittle Devil Inside is an upcoming action-adventure video game developed and published by Neostream Interactive. The game's single-player and co-operative multiplayer modes both follow the professional and personal lives of explorers searching for monsters & supernatural events in a 19th-century-inspired world. It is planned for initial release on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, with Nintendo Switch and Xbox One versions to come later.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nLittle Devil Inside is a third-person 3D action-adventure role-playing video game with elements of survival, combat, and open-world exploration; however, its developers, Neostream Interactive, have described the game's survival elements as \"rather easy\" compared to other games in the survival genre, stating that the game is \"not about how long you can survive in a certain environment\", instead being about \"taking a trip for a mission, and surviving during the process.\" Examples of in-game survival elements include harvesting water from cacti, chopping wood to make a fire, and cooking food obtained from hunting. Players can use a variety of weapons and tools to survive and accomplish their objectives, such as a sword, shield, gun, grappling hook, bombs, tent, and cooking equipment.\nThe game takes places across multiple locations with differing environmental conditions, including desert, snow, forest, mountains, swampland, and deep-sea diving. These areas are connected by a \"world map\", which uses tilt-shift effects to create the appearance of miniature scale. Although this overall map is available, players cannot \"fast forward\" their travel to these locations; instead, they must take direct control of their transportation during the journey and respond to events that occur on the way, such as encounters with NPCs, overcoming obstacles (such as a flock of sheep), or being ambushed by enemies. Players also have the ability to upgrade their transportation (alongside their weapons and armor) as the game progresses.\nBetween missions, players can return to the safety of the game's home town to rest and prepare for further adventures (such as talking with NPCs, gathering information on the next location through library research, and preparing for its weather conditions).\nThe game also includes roguelike gameplay elements: In the event of a player's character dying, that character cannot be resurrected; however, the player can take subsequent characters to that same location in order to recover any lost equipment.\nThe game also supports co-operative multiplayer (including local multiplayer), where more than one player participates in the same mission. Additionally, the game features the possibility of random encounters between players.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nLittle Devil Inside takes place in a 19th-century, Victorian-inspired setting, with elements of steampunk. The developers describe it as a \"surreal, unrealistic world ... somewhere between heaven and hell.\" The main character, Billy, is a swordsman, employed by a research team (led by college professor Vincent and his colleague, Dr. Oliver) to travel the world in search of the supernatural and other unusual incidents. The ultimate objective set out by the researchers is to assemble a complete encyclopaedia of \"all phenomenal existence.\"\nThe game also takes a satirical angle on the video game clich√© of hunting monsters for financial reward by also exploring the more mundane aspects of such characters' lives and their financial inequality with their employers.\n\n\n== Development and release ==\nLittle Devil Inside was originally conceived by its creative director, Kody Lee, and was developed as the first game by Seoul's Neostream Interactive, who initially began in 1998 as a multimedia design & production company. Development began originally using the Unity Engine, then later switched to the Unreal Engine by Epic Games. The game was first announced through a Kickstarter campaign in April 2015, alongside a pre-alpha trailer and \nThe Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) (palawa kani: purinina) is a carnivorous marsupial of the family Dasyuridae. It was formerly present across mainland Australia, but became extinct there around 3,500 years ago; it is now confined to the island of Tasmania. The size of a small dog, the Tasmanian devil became the largest carnivorous marsupial in the world following the extinction of the thylacine in 1936. It is related to quolls, and distantly related to the thylacine. It is characterised by its stocky and muscular build, black fur, pungent odour, extremely loud and disturbing screech, keen sense of smell, and ferocity when feeding. The Tasmanian devil's large head and neck allow it to generate among the strongest bites per unit body mass of any extant predatory land mammal. It hunts prey and scavenges on carrion.\nAlthough devils are usually solitary, they sometimes eat and defecate together in a communal location. Unlike most other dasyurids, the devil thermoregulates effectively, and is active during the middle of the day without overheating. Despite its rotund appearance, it is capable of surprising speed and endurance, and can climb trees and swim across rivers. Devils are not monogamous. Males fight one another for females, and guard their partners to prevent female infidelity. Females can ovulate three times in as many weeks during the mating season, and 80% of two-year-old females are seen to be pregnant during the annual mating season.\nFemales average four breeding seasons in their life, and give birth to 20 to 30 live young after three weeks' gestation. The newborn are pink, lack fur, have indistinct facial features, and weigh around 0.20 g (0.0071 oz) at birth. As there are only four nipples in the pouch, competition is fierce, and few newborns survive. The young grow rapidly, and are ejected from the pouch after around 100 days, weighing roughly 200 g (7.1 oz). The young become independent after around nine months.\nIn 1941, devils became officially protected. Since the late 1990s, the devil facial tumour disease (DFTD) has drastically reduced the population and now threatens the survival of the species, which in 2008 was declared to be endangered. Starting in 2013, Tasmanian devils are again being sent to zoos around the world as part of the Australian government's Save the Tasmanian Devil Program. The devil is an iconic symbol of Tasmania and many organisations, groups and products associated with the state use the animal in their logos. It is seen as an important attractor of tourists to Tasmania and has come to worldwide attention through the Looney Tunes character of the same name.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nBelieving it to be a type of opossum, naturalist George Harris wrote the first published description of the Tasmanian devil in 1807, naming it Didelphis ursina, due to its bearlike characteristics such as the round ear. He had earlier made a presentation on the topic at the Zoological Society of London. However, that particular binomial name had been given to the common wombat (later reclassified as Vombatus ursinus) by George Shaw in 1800, and was hence unavailable. In 1838, a specimen was named Dasyurus laniarius by Richard Owen, but by 1877 he had relegated it to Sarcophilus. The modern Tasmanian devil was named Sarcophilus harrisii (\"Harris's flesh-lover\") by French naturalist Pierre Boitard in 1841.\nA later revision of the devil's taxonomy, published in 1987, attempted to change the species name to Sarcophilus laniarius based on mainland fossil records of only a few animals. However, this was not accepted by the taxonomic community at large; the name S. harrisii has been retained and S. laniarius relegated to a fossil species. \"Beelzebub's pup\" was an early vernacular name given to it by the explorers of Tasmania, in reference to a religious figure who is a prince of hell and an assistant of Satan; the explorers first encountered the animal by hearing its far-reaching vocalisations at night.

It is one of a number of Hollywood films dealing with the exploits of the Flying Tigers that began with the Republic Pictures production Flying Tigers (1942).\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter being shot down, \"Big Butch\" Dooley (Paul Kelly), a Flying Tigers pilot lands his Curtiss P-40 Warhawk in the ruins of a Chinese village. After he rescues a wounded boy, orphaned by the war, Dooley takes him back to his unit.\nThe young orphan is adopted by the Flying Tigers, and is called \"Little Butch\" Dooley. Big Butch and the other Tigers realize that the boy needs a proper education and send him to the Temple Missionary School run by \"Doc\" Temple (Harry Carey).\nLittle Butch organizes the other refugee children and trains them in fighting the invading Japanese. Leading the children, dubbed \"Little Devils,\" in nightly raids, Little Dutch takes over a store of gasoline, but he is wounded during the battle.\nTwo of the two of the Little Devils are taken prisoner while blowing up a Japanese supply base. When Doc pleads with a Japanese officer for their release, he learns about the attack on Pearl Harbor and realizes he will be taken prisoner. Little Butch rescues Doc, and soon after, the Japanese bomb the mission.\nLater, an American aircraft crashes, and the Little Devils race with the Japanese to reach the wreck. The Little Devils find the aircraft first and are surprised to discover that the pilot is Big Butch. After treating Big Butch's wounds, the Little Devils help him cross a river and return safely to the Chinese lines.\nAs the young boys are escaping, however, a Japanese patrol converges on them. They sacrifice their lives while shooting it out with the enemy, and sometime later, the spirit of Little Butch rides with Big Butch, as he drops bombs on Tokyo.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nMonogram Pictures had a history of B movie productions and China's Little Devils  fits that scenario. The film utilized sequences from Flying Tigers (1942) as well, as the Curtiss P-40 mockups used in the earlier film.\nPrincipal photography on  China's Little Devils took place from June 30 until early August, 1944. Most of the filming took place on studio backlots.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nFilm historian Leonard Maltin described China's Little Devils as a \"Patriotic WW2 yarn involving Chinese waifs who battle Japanese invaders and come to the aid of downed American pilots.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nChina's Little Devils at the TCM Movie Database\nChina's Little Devils at IMDb\nThe Devil All the Time is the debut novel by American writer Donald Ray Pollock, published in 2011 by Doubleday. Its plot follows desperate characters in post-World War II Southern Ohio and West Virginia, including a disturbed war veteran, a husband and wife who are serial killers, and an abusive preacher. A film adaptation of the same name directed by Antonio Campos and narrated by Pollock, starred Tom Holland, Sebastian Stan, Robert Pattinson and Bill Skarsg√•rd, and was produced by Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe Devil All the Time follows the events and fates of various characters who all carry their own secrets from the past. As the novel progresses the lives of these people converge in unexpected ways.\nIn a prologue, Pollock introduces the protagonist, Arvin, as a young boy. He sits in a clearing with his father, Willard, on an oak log, joining him in his evening prayer routine. Willard is borderline obsessive when it comes to prayer and expects the same from his son. While Arvin prays, however, his mind wanders and feelings of isolation bubble to the surface. Feeling like an outsider at school, he is the victim of relentless bullying. Arvin recalls his father telling him to stand up for himself, but this is easier said than done.\nThe rest of the book is divided into seven parts. Part One, \"Sacrifice,\" begins in 1945, before the prologue. Willard is a young single man who has just been discharged from combat duty after the end of World War II. As he sits on a bus headed to his home in Coal Creek, West Virginia, he recalls the horrifying things he saw and did during the war. One memory haunts him in particular: that of a soldier he comes across who has been skinned and crucified. Willard shoots the man as an act of mercy, putting an end to his suffering. The bus makes a stop at the Wooden Spoon Diner in Meade, Ohio. There, Willard meets and instantly falls in love with a beautiful waitress, Charlotte Willoughby. At home, he is met by his nervous and emotionally-damaged mother, Emma, and her brother, Uncle Earskell. Willard proceeds to get drunk, and his thoughts turn from the horrors of war to the beautiful waitress he just met. He lets it slip to his mother that he has fallen in love, which upsets her because she made a bargain with God that if he let her son live, she would arrange a marriage between Willard and poor Helen Hatton.\nAt church one evening, we meet Brother Roy and Brother Theodore, Roy‚Äôs fat and crippled cousin. They preach about letting God cure you of your worst fears and Roy dumps a bin full of spiders on his head, scaring almost everyone in the chapel. Helen takes a liking to Roy and they later have a daughter named Lenora.\nFeeling his connection with God lessen, Roy decides that in order to regain his bond he must crucify something and raise it from the dead. Theodore, who hates Helen for taking Roy‚Äôs attention, convinces Roy to kill her for the sacrifice. They take her out to a field and Roy stabs her in the neck with a screwdriver. As expected, Roy is unable to raise her from the dead and they flee the town, leaving Lenora with Emma (Willard's mother).\nLinking back up with other characters, Willard marries Charlotte and together they have a son whom they name Arvin. As the years pass, Willard becomes obsessed with prayer. The obsession only deepens when Charlotte is diagnosed with cancer. Willard's rituals become progressively more bizarre and upsetting, culminating in animal and even human sacrifice. Willard believes these acts of devotion are necessary to save his wife. Nevertheless, in the end, Charlotte still dies, prompting Willard to commit suicide. Traumatized by his parents' deaths and his father's behavior, Arvin lives with his grandmother, Emma. There, he meets Lenora, an orphan girl whom Emma takes in after her mother, Helen, is killed, the prime suspects in everyone‚Äôs mind being the traveling preacher named Roy who is also Lenora's father.\nIn Part 2, \"On the Hunt,\" the reader is introduc\nDevils Tower (also known as Bear Lodge) is a butte, possibly laccolithic, composed of igneous rock in the Bear Lodge Ranger District of the Black Hills, near Hulett and Sundance in Crook County, northeastern Wyoming, above the Belle Fourche River. It rises 1,267 feet (386 m) above the Belle Fourche River, standing 867 feet (264 m) from summit to base. The summit is 5,112 feet (1,558 m) above sea level.\nDevils Tower National Monument was the first United States national monument, established on September 24, 1906, by President Theodore Roosevelt. The monument's boundary encloses an area of 1,347 acres (545 ha).\n\n\n== Name ==\nIndigenous names for the monolith include \"Bear's House\" or \"Bear's Lodge\" (or \"Bear's Tipi\", \"Home of the Bear\", \"Bear's Lair\"); Cheyenne, Lakota: Mat»ü√≥ Th√≠pila, Crow: Daxpitcheeaas√°ao (\"Home of Bears\"), \"Aloft on a Rock\" (Kiowa), \"Tree Rock\", \"Great Gray Horn\", and \"Brown Buffalo Horn\" (Lakota: Pteh√© «¶√≠).\nThe name \"Devil's Tower\" originated in 1875 during an expedition led by Colonel Richard Irving Dodge, when his interpreter reportedly misinterpreted a native name to mean \"Bad God's Tower\". All information signs in that area use the name \"Devils Tower\", following a geographic naming standard whereby the apostrophe is omitted.\nIn 2005, a proposal to recognize several indigenous ties through the additional designation of the monolith as Bear Lodge National Historic Landmark were opposed by United States Representative Barbara Cubin, arguing that a \"name change will harm the tourist trade and bring economic hardship to area communities\". In November 2014, Arvol Looking Horse proposed renaming the geographical feature \"Bear Lodge\" and submitted the request to the United States Board on Geographic Names. A second proposal was submitted to request that the U.S. acknowledge what it described as the \"offensive\" mistake in keeping the current name and to rename the monument and sacred site into Bear Lodge National Historic Landmark. The formal public comment period ended in fall 2015. Local state senator Ogden Driskill opposed the change. The name was not changed.\n\n\n== Geology ==\n\nThe landscape surrounding Devils Tower is composed mostly of sedimentary rocks. The oldest rocks visible in Devils Tower National Monument were laid down in a shallow sea during the Triassic. This dark red sandstone and maroon siltstone, interbedded with shale, can be seen along the Belle Fourche River. Oxidation of iron minerals causes the redness of the rocks. This rock layer is known as the Spearfish Formation. Above the Spearfish Formation is a thin band of white gypsum, called the Gypsum Springs Formation, Jurassic in age. Overlying this formation is the Sundance Formation. During the Paleocene Epoch, 56 to 66 million years ago, the Rocky Mountains and the Black Hills were uplifted. Magma rose through the crust, intruding into the existing sedimentary rock layers.\nGeologists Carpenter and Russell studied Devils Tower in the late 19th century and came to the conclusion that it was formed by an igneous intrusion. In 1907, geologists Nelson Horatio Darton and C.C. O'Harra (of the South Dakota School of Mines) theorized that Devils Tower must be an eroded remnant of a laccolith.\nThe igneous material that forms the Tower is a phonolite porphyry intruded about 40.5 million years ago, a light to dark-gray or greenish-gray igneous rock with conspicuous crystals of white feldspar. As the magma cooled, hexagonal columns formed (though sometimes 4-, 5-, and 7-sided columns were possible), up to 20 feet (6.1 m) wide and 600 feet (180 m) tall.\nAs rain and snow continue to erode the sedimentary rocks surrounding the Tower's base, more of Devils Tower will be exposed. Nonetheless, the exposed portions of the Tower still experience certain amounts of erosion. Cracks along the columns are subject to water and ice erosion. Portions, or even entire columns, of rock at Devils Tower are continually breaking off and falling. Piles of broken columns, boul\nThe following is a list of episodes for the television show Little House on the Prairie, an American Western drama about a family living on a farm in Walnut Grove, Minnesota from the 1870s to the 1890s. The show is a full-colour version of Laura Ingalls Wilder‚Äôs series of Little House books.\nThe regular series was preceded by the two-hour pilot movie, which first aired on March 30, 1974. The series began on the NBC network on September 11, 1974, and ended on May 10, 1982.

Imbued with a mischievous personality and able to produce fire, Hot Stuff appears as a red child devil who wears a diaper (said to be made of asbestos) and carries a magical sentient pitchfork (referred to as his \"trusty trident\"), which is a character in its own right. Much to the consternation of his demonic brethren, Hot Stuff sometimes performs good deeds to irritate them.\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nCreated and first drawn by Warren Kremer, Hot Stuff has appeared in at least eight comic book titles including:\n\nHot Stuff Sizzlers (1960)\nDevil Kids Starring Hot Stuff (1962)\nHot Stuff Creepy Caves (1974)\nThe character also appeared in multiple back-up stories between the periods 1957-1982 and 1986-1991, along with sporadic appearances in other publications during the 1990s and 2000s. The most recent appearance of Hot Stuff was in 2009 with Casper the Friendly Ghost and Wendy the Good Little Witch, when a three-issue comic book miniseries was published by Arden Entertainment called Casper and the Spectrals.\nWarren Kremer and Howard Post were the artists who helped define the look of Hot Stuff, drawing many comic book covers and stories over the years. Ernie Col√≥n was another major comics artist who drew Hot Stuff.\nWhile Harvey Comics flagship characters Casper the Friendly Ghost, Spooky and Wendy the Good Little Witch often crossed over into each other's stories, Hot Stuff rarely appeared with them. Instead, the little devil would be featured with characters like Stumbo the Giant (created by Warren Kremer and Larz Bourne, and appeared in back-up stories in Hot Stuff comics in 1957), Katnip the cat, Herman the mouse and good fairy Princess Charma. While they often tended to annoy or anger Hot Stuff, their appearances served to further develop Hot Stuff's character.\n\n\n== Comic book series ==\nHot Stuff the Little Devil\nDevil Kids Starring Hot Stuff\nHot Stuff Creepy Caves\nHot Stuff Sizzlers\nHot Stuff Digest \nHarvey Wiseguys\nAstro Comics\nCasper And...\nHot Stuff the Little Devil, Vol. 2\nCasper and his Friends Magazine (Marvel Comics)\nCasper and the Spectrals (Arden Entertainment)\nHot Stuff the Little Devil Halloween Special (Dark House Comics)\nHarvey Comics Treasury (Dark House comics)\nHarvey Hits (Joe Books)\nCasper the Friendly Ghost (American Mythology Productions)\n\n\n== Recurring characters ==\nAunt Clinker, Hot Stuff's aunt and primary guardian, who resembles a witch but is a devil.

The Devils compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Metropolitan Division in the Eastern Conference. The club was founded as the Kansas City Scouts in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1974. The Scouts moved to Denver in 1976 and became the Colorado Rockies. In 1982, they moved to East Rutherford, New Jersey, and took their current name, which is derived from the legendary Jersey Devil creature. For their first 25 seasons in New Jersey, the Devils were based at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford and played their home games at Brendan Byrne Arena (later renamed Continental Airlines Arena). Before the 2007‚Äì08 season, the team moved to Prudential Center in Newark. The Devils are owned and managed by Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment (HBSE), with founders Josh Harris and David Blitzer acquiring the team in 2013.\nThe franchise was poor to mediocre in the eight years before moving to New Jersey, a pattern that continued during the first five years in New Jersey as they failed to make the Stanley Cup playoffs and never finished higher than fifth in their division, which had six teams at the time. Their fortunes began to turn around following the hiring of the president and general manager Lou Lamoriello in 1987. Under Lamoriello's stewardship, the Devils made the playoffs all but three times between 1988 and 2012, including 13 berths in a row from 1997 to 2010, and finished with a winning record every season from 1992‚Äì93 to 2009‚Äì10. They have won the Atlantic Division regular season title nine times, most recently in 2009‚Äì10, before transferring to the newly created Metropolitan Division as part of the NHL's realignment in 2013. The Devils have reached the Stanley Cup Finals five times, winning in 1994‚Äì95, 1999‚Äì2000 and 2002‚Äì03, and losing in 2000‚Äì01 and 2011‚Äì12. The Devils were known for their defense-first approach throughout their years of Cup contention, and were one of the teams credited with popularizing the neutral zone trap in the mid-1990s.\nThe Devils have a rivalry with their cross-Hudson River neighbor, the New York Rangers, as well as a rivalry with the Philadelphia Flyers. The Devils are one of three NHL teams in the New York metropolitan area; the others are the Rangers and the New York Islanders. The Devils are one of four major professional sports teams that play their home games in New Jersey; the others are the National Football League's New York Giants and New York Jets, and the New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer. Since the relocation of the New Jersey Nets to Brooklyn in 2012, the Devils have been the only major league team in any sport to bill themselves as representing the state of New Jersey.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Kansas City and Colorado ===\n\nIn 1972, the NHL announced plans to add two expansion teams, including one in Kansas City, Missouri, owned by a group headed by Edwin G. Thompson. The new team was officially named the Scouts in reference to Cyrus E. Dallin's statue of the same name which stands in that city's Penn Valley Park. In the team's inaugural season, 1974‚Äì75, the Scouts were forced to wait until the ninth game to play in Kansas City's Kemper Arena, and did not post a win until beating the Washington Capitals, their expansion brethren, in their tenth contest. With 41 points in their inaugural season, the Scouts finished last in the Smythe Division; only the Capitals had fewer points in the NHL.

Helgesen and drummer Kristoffer Vold Austrheim under the name The Headless Children, a cover band of Slayer and Kreator. A year later singer Erik Borgen and guitarist Kenneth Bergsagel joined the group.\nThey changed the name to Carnal Tomb, then Borgen left the band and Helgesen became the singer/bassist with the female voice of Linn Achre Tveit (Keltziva). Elin Overskott joined the band as a keyboard player.\nThis was the first line-up of Dismal Euphony, officially formed in 1995. In the same year, the group composed the demo Spellbound. After this publication, they were signed by Napalm Records. Here they produced other albums like Soria Moria slott, Autumn Leaves: The Rebellion of Tides and the Lady Ablaze EP (which already features Anja Natasha as female singer).\nLater, Dismal Euphony joined Nuclear Blast and released All Little Devils, with the new female singer Anja Natasha.\nTheir last album is Python Zero.

It is named for its projected thumb-like appearance. Its name in the Tlingit language means \"the mountain that never flooded\" and is said to have been a refuge for people during Aangalakhu (\"the Great Flood\"). It is one of the peaks that marks the border between the United States and Canada, and is also listed on maps as Boundary Peak 71.\nDevils Thumb is a very challenging climb even for advanced mountain climbers.\n\n\n== Location ==\nDevils Thumb is part of a group of striking, difficult rock peaks on the western edge of the Stikine Icecap.  The Stikine Icecap occupies the crest of the Boundary Ranges, a subrange of the Coast Mountains spanning the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border, north of the mouth of the Stikine River.  Other peaks in the area include the Witches Tits and Cat's Ears Spires (part of the western ridge of the Devils Thumb massif itself), and Mount Burkett and Burkett Needle, a pair of spires about 8 mi (13 km) to the northeast.\n\n\n== Notable features ==\nThe most famous feature on the Devils Thumb among climbers is its Northwest Face, rising 6,700 ft (2,042 m) from the Witches Cauldron at its base to the summit, at an average angle of 67 degrees. This is the biggest rock face in North America.  The conditions prevalent also make it perhaps the most dangerous climbing proposition on the continent.\n\n\n== Climbing history ==\nThe first ascent of the Devils Thumb was a landmark in North American mountaineering. Fred Beckey, along with Clifford Schmidtke and Bob Craig, climbed the East Ridge, a route that combined technical difficulty equal to anything ever climbed on the continent to that time with great remoteness and terrible weather conditions. \nThe Northwest Face has seen many attempts; at least three teams have died on this face. It stands as a huge wall with bad weather, bad rock, bad ice, and bad avalanches. \"It is a dangerous and difficult face that rarely, if ever, comes into condition,\" says Dieter Klose, who in 1982 made it halfway up the route, higher than anybody else alive.\nIn 1977, author Jon Krakauer climbed the East Ridge of the Devils Thumb, a feat described in detail in his book Eiger Dreams: Ventures Among Men and Mountains. Krakauer also chronicles his solo ascent of Devils Thumb in chapters 14 and 15 of his book Into the Wild.\nIn 2024, Alex Honnold and Tommy Caldwell successfully scaled all 5 peaks in just under 12 hours, completing the first ever single day traverse of the Devil‚Äôs Thumb skyline.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlaska boundary dispute\n\n\n== Notes ==\n^  The peak's official name carries no apostrophe.\n^  A shoulder of the peak is the crash site of Dirk Benedict's character's plane in the 1996 film Alaska.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\"Devils Thumb\".

The monument protects Devils Postpile, an unusual rock formation of columnar basalt, \"all closely and perfectly fitted together like a vast mosaic.\" The monument encompasses 798 acres (323 ha) and includes two main attractions: the Devils Postpile formation and Rainbow Falls, a waterfall on the Middle Fork of the San Joaquin River. In addition, the John Muir Trail and Pacific Crest Trail merge into one trail as they pass through the monument. Excluding a small developed area containing the monument headquarters, visitor center and a campground, the National Monument lies within the borders of the Ansel Adams Wilderness.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe monument was established in 1911 as \"Devil Postpile National Monument,\" (no possessive) but is widely referred to as Devils Postpile National Monument, and has been officially styled as plural without the apostrophe since the 1930s.\nAn alternate historic name was Devil's Woodpile. According to Historic Spots in California (1966), \"In every scenic freak the sheep-herder recognizes the work of his Satanic majesty. This formation is therefore known to local fame as the Devil's Woodpile.\"\nThe monument was once part of Yosemite National Park, but discovery of gold in 1905 near Mammoth Lakes prompted a boundary change that left the Postpile on adjacent public land. Later, a proposal to build a hydroelectric dam called for blasting the Postpile into the river. Influential Californians, including John Muir, persuaded the federal government to stop the demolition and, in 1911, President William Howard Taft protected the area as a National Monument.\n\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\nThe elevation of the national monument is between 7,200 and 8,200 ft (2,200 and 2,500 m), and the flora and fauna are typical of the western Sierra Nevada at these elevations. The monument area contains animals and plants such as black bears, pine martens, mule deer, coyotes, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, alder, and willows, Dark-eyed juncos and white-crowned sparrows are common in the summer.\nNative wildflowers include:\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe most common method for accessing Devils Postpile is via the mandatory shuttle bus operated by Eastern Sierra Transit Authority in the summer months at the price of $15 for an adult, followed by a 1/4 mile walk. The shuttle route begins at Mammoth Mountain Ski Area's Adventure Center and makes several stops throughout the valley and begins operating when the Reds Meadow Road opens in the summer, and continues through Labor Day weekend.\nDevils Postpile is also accessible on foot from Mammoth Lakes by hiking over Mammoth Pass and into the Reds Meadow Valley. During the winter months, there are no services available, but adventurers can visit the site via cross-country ski or snowshoe.\nDue to the Reds Meadow Road reconstruction project for the 2024 season, entry is limited to Friday starting at 9 AM, all day Saturday, and Sunday until 11 PM, this schedule until September 15, 2024. From then until the winter closure, it‚Äôs only open on Saturdays and Sundays from 9 AM to 7 PM, and there‚Äôs no shuttle. It‚Äôs closed on other days for reconstruction of the road to improve access and safety.\n\n\n== Devils Postpile ==\n\nThe name \"Devils Postpile\" refers to a dark cliff of columnar basalt. Radiometric dating indicates the formation was created by a lava flow at some time less than 100,000 years ago. The source of the lava is thought to have been somewhere near Upper Soda Springs campground at the north end of Pumice Flat on the floor of the Middle Fork of the San Joaquin River, from where it flowed to the site of the Postpile. Estimates of the formation's thickness range from 400 feet (120 m) to 600 feet (180 m). The lava that now makes up the Postpile was near the bottom of this mass.\nBecause of its great thickness, much of the mass of pooled lava cooled slowly and evenly, which is why the column\nDevil facial tumour disease (DFTD) is an aggressive non-viral clonally transmissible cancer which affects Tasmanian devils, a marsupial native to the Australian island of Tasmania. The cancer manifests itself as lumps of soft and ulcerating tissue around the mouth, which may invade surrounding organs and metastasise to other parts of the body. Severe genetic abnormalities exist in cancer cells‚Äîfor example, DFT2 cells are tetraploid, containing twice as much genetic material as normal cells. DFTD is most often spread by bites, when teeth come into contact with cancer cells; less important pathways of transmission are ingesting of infected carcasses and sharing of food. Adult Tasmanian devils who are otherwise the fittest are most susceptible to the disease.\nDFTD is estimated to have first developed in 1986. There are two currently existing strains, both appearing to be derived from Schwann cells. DFT1 is the main and older strain that infects most of the devil population. It was first described in 1996 in an animal from Mount William National Park in northeastern Tasmania. DFT2 appeared around 2011 and was first detected in 2014; all cases are limited to the area of southern Tasmania near the D'Entrecasteaux Channel. There still remain disease-free pockets in the relatively isolated south-west of the island.\nThe disease poses a direct threat to the survival of Tasmanian devils as a species as the disease is almost universally fatal. In the two decades since the disease was first spotted, population of Devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) declined by 80% (locally exceeding 90%), as the condition spread through virtually entire Tasmania. The Tasmanian Government, Australian universities and zoos are engaged in efforts to curb the disease. Culling infected individuals, the policy used by state officials until 2010, brought little success. Thus the main prevention method became taking hundreds of devils into captivity and then releasing some of them into the wild. There is no cure for the cancer so far. Vaccination offers some promise in the fight against the pathogen, but researchers have not found a suitable candidate yet. A 2017 vaccine trial found that only 1 in 5 devils could resist DFTD; a DFT1 oral vaccine candidate is being tested in the captive devil population.\n\n\n== Clinical signs ==\nThere is often more than one primary tumour. Visible signs of DFTD begin with lumps of soft tissue around the mouth, which ulcerate. Tumours are locally aggressive, destroying the underlying bone of the jaw which interferes with feeding. Tumours may also cover the eyes. Devils usually die within six months from organ failure, secondary infection, or metabolic starvation.\nDFTD is rare in juveniles. It affects males and females equally.\n\n\n== Transmission ==\nThe most plausible route of transmission is through biting, particularly when canine teeth come into direct contact with the diseased cells. Other modes of transmission may include the ingestion of infected carcasses and the sharing of food, both of which involve an allogeneic transfer of cells between unrelated individuals. The animals most likely to become infected are the fittest devil individuals.\n\n\n== Pathology ==\nDFTD tumours are large soft tissue masses which become centrally ulcerated. The tumours are composed of lobules of nodules of round to spindle-shaped cells, often within a pseudocapsule. Tumours metastasise to regional lymph nodes involvement and systemically to the lungs, spleen and heart. \n\n\n== Tumour characteristics ==\n\nTasmanian devil cells have 14 chromosomes; the oldest-known strain of the tumour cells have thirteen chromosomes, nine of which are recognisable and four of which are mutated \"marker\" chromosomes. More recently evolved strains have an additional mutant marker chromosome, for a total of fourteen chromosomes. Researchers identified the cancer as a neuroendocrine tumour, and found identical chromosomal rearrangements in all the cancer cells. The karyotype anomalies of\nA devil is the mythical personification of evil as it is conceived in various cultures and religious traditions. It is seen as the objectification of a hostile and destructive force. Jeffrey Burton Russell states that the different conceptions of the devil can be summed up as 1) a principle of evil independent from God, 2) an aspect of God, 3) a created being turning evil (a fallen angel) or 4) a symbol of human evil.:‚Ää23‚Ää\nEach tradition, culture, and religion with a devil in its mythos offers a different lens on manifestations of evil. The history of these perspectives intertwines with theology, mythology, psychiatry, art, and literature, developing independently within each of the traditions. It occurs historically in many contexts and cultures, and is given many different names‚ÄîSatan (Judaism), Lucifer (Christianity), Beelzebub (Judeo-Christian), Mephistopheles (German), Iblis (Islam)‚Äîand attributes: it is portrayed as blue, black, or red; it is portrayed as having horns on its head, and without horns, and so on.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Modern English word devil derives from the Middle English devel, from the Old English dƒìofol, that in turn represents an early Germanic borrowing of the Latin diabolus. This in turn was borrowed from the Greek Œ¥ŒπŒ¨Œ≤ŒøŒªŒøœÇ di√°bolos, \"slanderer\", from Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ≤Œ¨ŒªŒªŒµŒπŒΩ diab√°llein, \"to slander\" from Œ¥ŒπŒ¨ di√°, \"across, through\" and Œ≤Œ¨ŒªŒªŒµŒπŒΩ b√°llein, \"to hurl\", probably akin to the Sanskrit gurate, \"he lifts up\".\n\n\n== Definitions ==\nIn his book The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity, Jeffrey Burton Russell discusses various meanings and difficulties that are encountered when using the term devil.  He does not claim to define the word in a general sense, but he describes the limited use that he intends for the word in his book‚Äîlimited in order to \"minimize this difficulty\" and \"for the sake of clarity\". In this book Russell uses the word devil as \"the personification of evil found in a variety of cultures\", as opposed to the word Satan, which he reserves specifically for the figure in the Abrahamic religions.\nIn the Introduction to his book Satan: A Biography, Henry Ansgar Kelly discusses various considerations and meanings that he has encountered in using terms such as devil and Satan, etc. While not offering a general definition, he describes that in his book \"whenever diabolos is used as the proper name of Satan\", he signals it by using \"small caps\".\nThe Oxford English Dictionary has a variety of definitions for the meaning of \"devil\", supported by a range of citations: \"Devil\" may refer to Satan, the supreme spirit of evil, or one of Satan's emissaries or demons that populate Hell, or to one of the spirits that possess a demoniac person; \"devil\" may refer to one of the \"malignant deities\" feared and worshiped by \"heathen people\", a demon, a malignant being of superhuman powers; figuratively \"devil\" may be applied to a wicked person, or playfully to a rogue or rascal, or in empathy often accompanied by the word \"poor\" to a person‚Äî\"poor devil\".\n\n\n== Bah√° º√≠ Faith ==\nIn the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, a malevolent, superhuman entity such as a devil or satan is not believed to exist. However, these terms do appear in the Bah√° º√≠ writings, where they are used as metaphors for the lower nature of man. Human beings are seen to have free will, and are thus able to turn towards God and develop spiritual qualities or turn away from God and become immersed in their self-centered desires. Individuals who follow the temptations of the self and do not develop spiritual virtues are often described in the Bah√° º√≠ writings with the word satanic. The Bah√° º√≠ writings also state that the devil is a metaphor for the \"insistent self\" or \"lower self\", which is a self-serving inclination within each individual. Those who follow their lower nature are also described as followers of \"the Evil One\".\n\n\n== Christianity ==\n\nIn Christianity, the devil or Satan is a fallen angel who is the primary opponent of God.

Later on, Sorychta and Lombardo founded the band Grip Inc. He recorded four albums with Grip Inc.: Power of Inner Strength (1995), Nemesis (1997) Solidify (1999) and Incorporated (2004).\nSorychta is also well known as a record producer, working with such bands as Lacuna Coil, Sentenced, Tiamat, Samael, The Gathering, Tristania, Moonspell, and many others.  In 1995 he was nominated for a Grammi in Sweden as \"Producer of the Year\" for his recording of Wildhoney by Tiamat.\nIn 1999, he recorded the album Sleep of the Angels of the Greek metal band Rotting Christ as a session  musician.\nFollowing the activity suspension of Grip Inc. in 2006, he founded the gothic metal band Eyes of Eden. He recorded with this band the album Faith, released on 17 August 2007. \nAlso in 2006, he founded the thrash metal group Enemy of the Sun, which recorded the album Shadows, released on 7 December 2007.\nIn 2009, he worked with Floor Jansen and Joost van den Broek, former members of the Dutch band After Forever, on their then new project called ReVamp.\nHe is also a well-known guest player for several bands, e.g. Therion on their tour in 2010.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Enemy of the Sun ===\nShadows (2007) ‚Äì guitar, producer\nCaedium (2010) ‚Äì guitar, producer\n\n\n=== Eyes of Eden ===\nFaith (2007) ‚Äì guitar, producer\n\n\n=== Despair ===\nHistory of Hate (1988) ‚Äì guitar, vocals, producer\nDecay of Humanity (1990) ‚Äì guitar, producer\nBeyond Reason (1992) ‚Äì guitar, producer\n\n\n=== Grip Inc. ===\nPower of Inner Strength (1995) ‚Äì guitar, backing vocals, producer\nNemesis (1997) ‚Äì guitar, keyboards, producer\nSolidify (1999) ‚Äì guitar, keyboards, producer\nIncorporated (2004) ‚Äì guitar, backing vocals, producer\n\n\n=== Rotting Christ ===\nSleep of the Angels (1999) ‚Äì guitar (session)\n\n\n=== Voodoocult ===\nJesus Killing Machine (1994) ‚Äì guitar, producer\n\n\n=== As producer ===\n\nTiamat ‚Äì   The Astral Sleep (1991)  ‚Äì also guitar\nUnleashed ‚Äì   Where No Life Dwells (1991)\nSamael ‚Äì  Blood Ritual (1992)\nUnleashed ‚Äì  Shadows in the Deep (1992)\nTiamat ‚Äì  Clouds (1992)\nSamael ‚Äì  Ceremony of Opposites (1994)\nTiamat ‚Äì Wildhoney (1994) ‚Äì also keyboards\nMoonspell ‚Äì  Wolfheart (1995)\nAlastis ‚Äì  ...And Death Smiled (1995)\nSamael ‚Äì  Rebellion (EP) (1995)\nThe Gathering ‚Äì Mandylion (1995)\nMoonspell ‚Äì  Irreligious (1996)\nSamael ‚Äì  Passage (1996)\nSentenced ‚Äì Down  (1996) ‚Äì also keyboards\nAlastis ‚Äì  The Other Side (1997) ‚Äì also keyboards\nSamael ‚Äì  Exodus (1998)\nMoonspell ‚Äì  Sin/Pecado (1998)\nLacuna Coil ‚Äì Lacuna Coil (EP) (1998)\nAlastis ‚Äì  Revenge (1998)\nSentenced ‚Äì   Frozen (1998) ‚Äì also keyboards\nTherion ‚Äì Vovin  (1998) ‚Äì also guitar\nTherion ‚Äì  Crowning of Atlantis (1999) ‚Äì also guitar\nLacuna Coil ‚Äì In a Reverie (1999) ‚Äì also keyboards\nDismal Euphony ‚Äì  All Little Devils (1999) ‚Äì also guitar, keyboards\nTherion ‚Äì  Deggial (2000) ‚Äì also acoustic guitar\nLacuna Coil ‚Äì  Halflife (2000)\nFlowing Tears ‚Äì  Jade (2000)\nLacuna Coil ‚Äì Unleashed Memories (2001)\nLacuna Coil ‚Äì  Comalies (2002)\nFlowing Tears ‚Äì  Serpentine (2002)\nFlowing Tears ‚Äì Razorbliss (2005)\nSamael ‚Äì  Reign of Light (2005)\nLacuna Coil ‚Äì Karmacode (2006)\nMoonspell ‚Äì  Memorial (2006) also bass guitar\nTristania ‚Äì Illumination (2006‚Äì2007)\nSamael ‚Äì  Solar Soul (2007)\nRusty Eye ‚Äì  Possessor (2009) also guest guitar, keyboards and mixing.\nWitchbreed ‚Äì Heretic Rapture (2009)\nThe Very End ‚Äì Mercy & Misery (2010)\nSodom ‚Äì In War and Pieces (2010)\nThe Other ‚Äì New Blood (2010)\nSamael ‚Äì  Lux Mundi (2010)\nExumer ‚Äì Fire & Damnation (2012)\nThe Very End ‚Äì Turn Off the World (2012)\nSodom ‚Äì Epitome of Torture (2013)\nCharm Designer ‚Äì Everlasting (2016)\nSam\nThe Tasmanian Devil (also spelled Tazmanian Devil), commonly referred to as Taz, is an animated cartoon character featured in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons. Though the character appeared in only five shorts before Warner Bros. Cartoons shut down in 1964, marketing and television appearances later propelled Taz to new popularity in the 1990s.\n\n\n== Personality ==\nTaz is generally portrayed as a ferocious, albeit dim-witted, carnivore with a notoriously short temper and little patience. In the short Ducking the Devil, he is described as a \"vicious, evil-tempered brute with jaws like a steel trap\". Though he can be very devious, he is also sweet at times. His enormous appetite seems to know no bounds, as he will eat anything in his path. He is best known for his speech consisting mostly of grunts, growls, and rasps (in his earlier appearances, he does speak English with primitive grammar) as well as his ability to spin like a vortex and bite through nearly anything. While in motion, he's often depicted as a spinning tornado, drilling himself through trees or soil.   Taz does have one weakness: he can be calmed by almost any music. While in this calm state, he can be easily dealt with. The only music known not to pacify Taz is the bagpipes, which he finds insufferable.\n\n\n== Creation ==\nRobert McKimson designed the character based on the real Tasmanian devil, or more specifically its carnivorous nature, voracious appetite, and surly disposition. A later model sheet was created by animator Ted Bonnicksen.\nOwen and Pemberton suggest that the character of the Tasmanian Devil was inspired by Tasmanian actor Errol Flynn.:‚Ää153‚Ää In 1939, apparently at the request of Warner Bros., the Tasmanian state government had sent three Tasmanian devils to California, where they were presented to the Los Angeles Zoo by Flynn's co-stars the Lane Sisters. Two of the devils escaped from the zoo within months and were reported to be roaming Griffith Park.\n\n\n== Appearances ==\nIn his first appearance in McKimson's Devil May Hare (first released on June 19, 1954), Taz stalks Bugs Bunny, but due to his dimwittedness and inability to frame complete sentences, he serves as little more than a nuisance. Bugs eventually gets rid of him in the most logical way possible: matching him up with an equally insatiable Tasmanian She-Devil. The character's speech, a deep, gravelly voice peppered with growls, screeches, and raspberries, is provided by Mel Blanc. Only occasionally would Taz actually speak, usually to utter some incongruous punchline (e.g. \"What for you bury me in the cold, cold ground?\"), and yet the character is capable of writing and reading. A running gag is that when Bugs Bunny hears of the approach of Taz, he looks him up in an encyclopedia and starts reading off a list of animals that Taz eats (which is pretty much everything that exists, including \"people\"). Bugs finds \"rabbits\" not listed until Taz enters and either points out that \"rabbits\" are listed or writes rabbits on the list.\nAfter the film short debuted at theaters, producer Edward Selzer, head of the Warner Bros. animation studio, ordered McKimson to shelve the character, feeling that he was too violent for children, and that parents would dislike him.:‚Ää157‚Ää After a time with no new Taz shorts, studio head Jack L. Warner asked what had happened to the character. Warner saved Taz's career when he told Selzer that he had received \"boxes and boxes\" of letters from people who liked the character and wanted to see more of him.\nMcKimson would go on to direct four more Taz cartoons, beginning with Bedevilled Rabbit (released on April 13, 1957). McKimson would also pair the Devil with Daffy Duck in Ducking the Devil (August 17, 1957) before pitting him once again against Bugs in Bill of Hare (June 9, 1962) and Dr. Devil and Mr. Hare (March 28, 1964). His last two appearances done by the classic Warner Brothers directors, writers, and voice actors were in Bugs B\nThe Little Devil River is a river of the Tasman Region of New Zealand's South Island.

Most of these bridges are stone or masonry arch bridges and represent a significant technological achievement in ancient architecture. Due to their unusual design, they were an object of fascination and stories in antiquity and medieval Europe.\nEach of the Devil's bridges typically has a corresponding Devil-related myth or folktale regarding its origin. These stories vary widely depending on the region and beliefs. Some have the Devil as the builder of the bridge, relating to the precariousness or impossibility of such a bridge to last or exist in the first place, so much so that only the Devil himself could have built it. Others have the knowledge to build such bridges given to mankind as a gift from the Devil as part of a deal, pact or bargain between the Devil and local populace, usually in exchange for their souls.\n\n\n== Associated legends ==\n\nThe bridges that fall into the Devil's Bridge category are so numerous that the legends about them form a special category in the Aarne-Thompson (AT) classification system for folktales (Number 1191). Some legends have elements of related folktale-categories, for example Deceiving the Devil (AT #1196), The Devil's Contract (AT #756B), and The Master Builder legends.\nOne version of the tale presents the bridge builder and the Devil as adversaries. This reflects the fact that frequently, such as in the case of the Teufelsbr√ºcke at the St Gotthard Pass, these bridges were built under such challenging conditions that successful completion of the bridge required a heroic effort on the part of the builders and the community, ensuring its legendary status.\nOther versions of the legend feature an old lady or a simple herder who makes a pact with the Devil. In this version the devil agrees to build the bridge, in return receiving the first soul to cross it. After building the bridge (often overnight) the devil is outwitted by his adversary (for example, by throwing bread to lure a dog over the bridge first) and is last seen descending into the water, bringing peace to the community.\nIn the case of the Steinerne Br√ºcke in Regensburg, the legend speaks of the devil helping in a race between the builders of the bridge and of the cathedral (in fact a significantly later construction), and a slight bump in the middle of the bridge is said to result from the devil's leaping with rage upon being tricked out of his prize.\nIn the legend of Teufelsbr√ºck in Hamburg, which leads only over a small stream, the carpenter, in a pact with the devil, promised him the first soul to cross the bridge. On the day of inauguration, while the priest and county councillor debated who should step on the bridge first, a rabbit crossed it and the disappointed devil disappeared. A statue refers to the legend there.\nThe legend of Ponte della Maddalena in Borgo a Mozzano, Province of Lucca, tells of a local saint (often Saint Julian, the Hospitaller) who makes the pact with the devil. On the day of delivery, the saint sets fire to a dog or a pig, which crosses the bridge and deceives the devil.\nAt Sens, a thirteenth-century legend tells of an architect who sold his soul to the devil and then subsequently repented. M. le Cur√© of Sens drove the devil away with holy water and with an exorcism formula beginning with the words Vade retro satana, which he made the penitent repeat.\nThe formula was, at some time, incorporated into the design of the popular Saint Benedict Medal.\nMost of the bridges that have received the \"Devil's Bridge\" appellation are remarkable in some regard, most often for the technological hurdles surpassed in building the bridge, but on occasion for its aesthetic grace as well, or for its economic or strategic importance to the community it serves.\n\n\n== List of bridges ==\n\n\n=== Antigua and Barbuda ===\nDevil's Bridge ‚Äì Antigua\n\n\n=== Argentina ===\nPuente La Noria ‚Äì Buenos Aires\n\n\n=== Bulgaria ===\nDyavolski most (–î—è–≤–æ–ª—Å–∫–∏ –º–æ\nThe Dark Pictures Anthology is an anthology series of interactive drama and survival horror video games developed and published by Supermassive Games (first season published by Bandai Namco Entertainment).

Jung Tae-seok is a cop who goes through the crime scene and suspects it to be the work of a serial killer, but his commanding officer does not believe him. Jang Dong-soo is a crime boss who, while on his way home after a meeting, is hit by the same killer, who tries to kill him as well. A brutal fight ensues, leaving both of them injured. Finally, the killer escapes after hitting Dong-soo with his car. Dong-soo is admitted to the hospital, and his henchmen assume that the attack was committed by a rival gang, whom they counter-attack.\nHowever, Dong-soo believes the killer was not a rival gang member as his moves seemed to be random and purposeless. Tae-suk visits Dong-soo at the hospital and asks him to cooperate so that the police can catch the killer for him, but Dong-soo refuses. Instead, Dong-soo orders his men to find the killer. Using a sketch and Dong-soo's memory of the killer's license plate, they manage to find his car and a knife. Dong-soo eventually informs Tae-suk of the findings, and they decide to team up to catch the mysterious killer. Dong-soo agrees to provide manpower and cover expenses ‚Äî but on the condition that the killer belongs to the one who finds him first. Dong-soo wants to kill him for revenge while Tae-suk wants to arrest him in order to solve five connected murder cases and eventually get promoted.\nMeanwhile, Dong-soo orders his right-hand man, Kwon Oh-sung, to kill his rival Heo Sang-do with the killer's knife that already has traces of blood from the killer's previous victims. An enraged Tae-suk gets into a fight with Dong-soo upon learning what he has done as the killing is confirmed to be the work of a serial killer, causing the case to be transferred to the major case squad. Dong-soo attends Sang-do's funeral; the killer also turns up and informs Sang-do's second-in-command that Sang-do was killed with the killer's knife, but by someone else. When Tae-suk and Dong-soo check the killer's car for any evidence, they are attacked by Sang-do's henchmen. A fight ensues, resulting in the death of Sang-do's right-hand man while in a fight with Tae-suk.\nDong-soo gets him buried and clears the scene. Tae-suk gets assigned to investigate a kidnapping case and, while solving it, spots the killer. A chase ensues, but the killer is able to escape. Through forensic test, Tae-suk discovers the killer to be a missing person. He informs Dong-soo about this and lets him hear a voice clip to confirm the missing person is the killer. Later, Dong-soo helps a high school girl by giving her his umbrella but soon learns that the girl has been murdered and his umbrella was found at the crime scene. Dong-soo and Tae-suk and their men start looking for the killer in the area where the girl was murdered and eventually find him in a car. In the ensuing chase, the killer manages to kill Oh-sung but is finally captured and incapacitated by Dong-soo. Dong-soo takes the killer away to torture and kill him, but Tae-suk tracks them down and crashes his car into the hideout just as Dong-soo is about to kill the killer.  Tae-suk hits Dong-soo with his car and arrests the killer.\nThe police have no conclusive evidence against the killer, Kang Kyu\nLittle Nicky is a 2000 American action fantasy black comedy film directed by Steven Brill, written by Tim Herlihy, Adam Sandler, and Brill, and starring Sandler in the title role, Patricia Arquette, Harvey Keitel, Tommy \"Tiny\" Lister Jr., Rhys Ifans, and Rodney Dangerfield with supporting roles by Allen Covert, Kevin Nealon, Jon Lovitz, Michael McKean, and Quentin Tarantino.\nThe film depicts the son of Satan and an angel who is tasked with returning his two brothers to Hell and preventing them from destroying the boundary between good and evil on Earth.\nLittle Nicky established the shared universe of Adam Sandler's films. The film received negative reviews from critics and was a box office bomb, grossing $58.3 million against an $80‚Äì85 million budget.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nWith his 10,000-year reign coming to an end, Satan must decide which of his three sons will succeed him as ruler of Hell. Adrian is the most devious, Cassius is the cruelest and Nicky is the kindest. Nicky has had a speech impediment and a disfigured jaw since Cassius hit him in the face with a shovel. Satan assembles his sons to tell them that as they are not yet ready to succeed him, he will continue ruling Hell.\nAngered by this decision, Adrian and Cassius travel to Earth to create a new Hell by possessing religious and political leaders in New York City. As they leave, they freeze the entrance to Hell, preventing more evil souls from entering and causing Satan to begin to disintegrate. Stanley the Gatekeeper informs Satan of this and Satan punishes him by growing breasts on his head and giving him to his father Lucifer. Now very weak, to stop Adrian and Cassius, he sends Nicky to Earth with a silver flask that traps whoever drinks from it inside.\nNicky has difficulty surviving on Earth and is killed several times, landing in Hell and returning to New York each time. While learning how to eat and sleep, he meets a possessed talking bulldog named Mr. Beefy, rents an apartment with an actor named Todd and falls in love with a design student named Valerie. Nicky encounters Adrian but fails to capture him and scares Valerie away. Nicky then observes Cassius on television possessing the referee of a Harlem Globetrotters game. Nicky arrives at the game and successfully tricks Cassius into the flask. Satanist metalheads John and Peter swear loyalty to Nicky. That evening, Nicky apologizes to Valerie and they reconcile.\nThe following day, Adrian possesses the Chief of the NYPD and accuses Nicky of mass murder. Nicky has Todd kill him so he can go back to Hell and ask his father for advice. However, Satan has trouble hearing because his ears have fallen off, and his assistants are panicking because the deadline to capture Adrian and Cassius is approaching.\nBack on Earth, Nicky and his friends devise a plan to capture Adrian in a subway station. Adrian discovers their trick and in the ensuing fight, grabs Valerie and dives onto the track as a train approaches, but Nicky throws her aside, leaving himself and Adrian to be killed by the train.\nArriving in Hell just minutes before midnight, Adrian begins taking over Hell by pushing what remains of his father aside and sitting on the throne, rising to Central Park, and starting a riotous party. Meanwhile, Nicky wakes up in Heaven as a reward for sacrificing himself and meets his mother Holly, an angel who tells him that he can defeat Adrian with the \"inner light\" that he inherited from her.\nAfter she gives him a mysterious orb, he confronts Adrian in Central Park. Adrian appears to win the battle by transforming into a bat and locking Nicky in the flask. However, Nicky escapes from the flask and shatters the orb, causing Ozzy Osbourne to appear, bite off Adrian's head, and spit it into the flask.\nWith his brothers captured, Nicky prepares to save his father. He and Valerie express their love for each other and she kills him. In Hell, Satan regains his body and suggests Nicky stay with Valerie to maintain things in the middle whi",

It is characterised by its stocky and muscular build, black fur, pungent odour, extremely loud and disturbing screech, keen sense of smell, and ferocity when feeding.

However, that particular binomial name had been given to the common wombat (later reclassified as Vombatus ursinus) by George Shaw in 1800, and was hence unavailable. In 1838, a specimen was named Dasyurus laniarius by Richard Owen, but by 1877 he had relegated it to Sarcophilus.

Little Butch rescues Doc, and soon after, the Japanese bomb the mission.\nLater, an American aircraft crashes, and the Little Devils race with the Japanese to reach the wreck. The Little Devils find the aircraft first and are surprised to discover that the pilot is Big Butch. After treating Big Butch's wounds, the Little Devils help him cross a river and return safely to the Chinese lines.\nAs the young boys are escaping, however, a Japanese patrol converges on them. They sacrifice their lives while shooting it out with the enemy, and sometime later, the spirit of Little Butch rides with Big Butch, as he drops bombs on Tokyo."

He sits in a clearing with his father, Willard, on an oak log, joining him in his evening prayer routine. Willard is borderline obsessive when it comes to prayer and expects the same from his son. While Arvin prays, however, his mind wanders and feelings of isolation bubble to the surface. Feeling like an outsider at school, he is the victim of relentless bullying. Arvin recalls his father telling him to stand up for himself, but this is easier said than done."

The Tasmanian Government, Australian universities and zoos are engaged in efforts to curb the disease. Culling infected individuals, the policy used by state officials until 2010, brought little success. Thus the main prevention method became taking hundreds of devils into captivity and then releasing some of them into the wild. There is no cure for the cancer so far. Vaccination offers some promise in the fight against the pathogen, but researchers have not found a suitable candidate yet.

Only occasionally would Taz actually speak, usually to utter some incongruous punchline (e.g. \"What for you bury me in the cold, cold ground?\"), and yet the character is capable of writing and reading. A running gag is that when Bugs Bunny hears of the approach of Taz, he looks him up in an encyclopedia and starts reading off a list of animals that Taz eats (which is pretty much everything that exists, including \"people\").

Originally releasing hardcore punk records, the label moved on to releasing albums by thrash metal, melodic death metal, grindcore, industrial metal, power metal and black metal bands, as well as tribute albums. It also distributes and promotes post-hardcore/metalcore labels SharpTone Records; another post-hardcore/metalcore label, Arising Empire, was in Nuclear Blast portfolio until its acquirement by Kontor New Media in 2020.\nIn October 2018, French independent label Believe Digital acquired a majority stake in Nuclear Blast.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nNuclear Blast was formed in 1987 after founder Markus Staiger traveled throughout the United States for four weeks and saw a gig of his favorite band BL'AST!. The label's first release was a vinyl compilation called Senseless Death (NB 001) featuring US hardcore bands like Attitude, Sacred Denial, Impulse Manslaughter and others.\nSwedish band Meshuggah became the first band in the history of Nuclear Blast Records to crack the Billboard 200, landing at number 165 with their 2002 album, Nothing. Meshuggah also became the first Nuclear Blast band to be reviewed in Rolling Stone magazine.\nIn 2004, Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish released Once on Nuclear Blast, which rocketed to the top of the charts in multiple countries, including Finland, Germany, Norway, Greece, Sweden, Austria, and more. It became the first release in the company's history to reach number 1 on the German charts. Slayer released the album Repentless in 2015 which went to number 4 on the Billboard 200 making it the highest charting Nuclear Blast release in the United States.\nDuring the 2000s and 2010s, Nuclear Blast signed many veteran thrash metal bands including Slayer, Exodus, Testament, Anthrax, Kreator, Overkill, Sepultura, Destruction, Tankard, Death Angel, and Heathen.\nIn 2021, Nuclear Blast founder Markus Staiger launched a new record company called Atomic Fire GmbH.\nIn June 2022, Nuclear Blast unveiled a new logo. The logo caused some controversy when the canned water company Liquid Death jokingly noted its similarities with their logo (which also features a melting skull), inadvertedly leading to its designer, Justin Moll, receiving hate mail. Liquid Death quickly apologized for the joke, saying that it was not targeted at Moll but at Nuclear Blast, whose personnel had reportedly raised concerns over the new logo's similarities with Liquid Death's before it was implemented.\nOn 23 August 2022, the video game Saints Row was released, which features an in-game radio station that includes Nuclear Blast artists.\n\n\n== Blood Blast Distribution ==\nBlood Blast Distribution is a subsidiary of Nuclear Blast that focuses solely on the distribution of extreme music.

The driving reaction may be nuclear fission or nuclear fusion or a multi-stage cascading combination of the two, though to date all fusion-based weapons have used a fission device to initiate fusion, and a pure fusion weapon remains a hypothetical device. Nuclear explosions are used in nuclear weapons and nuclear testing.\nNuclear explosions are extremely destructive compared to conventional (chemical) explosives, because of the vastly greater energy density of nuclear fuel compared to chemical explosives. They are often associated with mushroom clouds, since any large atmospheric explosion can create such a cloud. Nuclear explosions produce high levels of ionizing radiation and radioactive debris that is harmful to humans and can cause moderate to severe skin burns, eye damage, radiation sickness, radiation-induced cancer and possible death depending on how far a person is from the blast radius. Nuclear explosions can also have detrimental effects on the climate, lasting from months to years. A small-scale nuclear war could release enough particles into the atmosphere to cause the planet to cool and cause crops, animals, and agriculture to disappear across the globe‚Äîan effect named nuclear winter.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The beginning (fission explosions) ===\nThe first manmade nuclear explosion occurred on July 16, 1945, at 5:50 am on the Trinity test site near Alamogordo, New Mexico, in the United States, an area now known as the White Sands Missile Range. The event involved the full-scale testing of an implosion-type fission atomic bomb. In a memorandum to the U.S. Secretary of War, General Leslie Groves describes the yield as equivalent to 15,000 to 20,000 tons of TNT. Following this test, a uranium-gun type nuclear bomb (Little Boy) was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, with a blast yield of 15 kilotons; and a plutonium implosion-type bomb (Fat Man) on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945, with a blast yield of 21 kilotons. Fat Man and Little Boy are the only instances in history of nuclear weapons being used as an act of war.\nOn August 29, 1949, the USSR became the second country to successfully test a nuclear weapon. RDS-1, dubbed \"First Lightning\" by the Soviets and \"Joe-1\" by the US, produced a 20 kiloton explosion and was essentially a copy of the American Fat Man plutonium implosion design.\n\n\n=== Thermonuclear Era (fusion explosions) ===\nThe United States' first thermonuclear weapon, Ivy Mike, was detonated on 1 November 1952 at Enewetak Atoll and yielded 10 Megatons of explosive force. The first thermonuclear weapon tested by the USSR, RDS-6s (Joe-4), was detonated on August 12, 1953, at the Semipalatinsk Test Site in Kazakhstan and yielded about 400 kilotons. RDS-6s' design, nicknamed the Sloika, was remarkably similar to a version designed for the U.S. by Edward Teller nicknamed the \"Alarm Clock\", in that the nuclear device was a two-stage weapon: the first explosion was triggered by fission and the second more powerful explosion by fusion. The Sloika core consisted of a series of concentric spheres with alternating materials to help boost the explosive yield.\n\n\n=== Proliferation Era ===\nIn the years following World War II, eight countries have conducted nuclear tests with 2475 devices fired in 2120 tests. In 1963, the United States, Soviet Union, and United Kingdom signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty, pledging to refrain from testing nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, underwater, or in outer space. The treaty permitted underground tests. Many other non-nuclear nations acceded to the Treaty following its entry into force; however, France and China (both nuclear weapons states) have not.\nThe primary application to date has been military (i.e. nuclear weapons), and the remainder of explosions include the following:\n\nNuclear pulse propulsion, including using a nuclear explosion \nThe effects of a nuclear explosion on its immediate vicinity are typically much more destructive and multifaceted than those caused by conventional explosives. In most cases, the energy released from a nuclear weapon detonated within the lower atmosphere can be approximately divided into four basic categories:\n\nthe blast and shock wave: 50% of total energy\nthermal radiation: 35% of total energy\nionizing radiation: 5% of total energy (more in a neutron bomb)\nresidual radiation: 5‚Äì10% of total energy with the mass of the explosion.\nDepending on the design of the weapon and the location in which it is detonated, the energy distributed to any one of these categories may be significantly higher or lower. The physical blast effect is created by the coupling of immense amounts of energy, spanning the electromagnetic spectrum, with the surroundings. The environment of the explosion (e.g. submarine, ground burst, air burst, or exo-atmospheric) determines how much energy is distributed to the blast and how much to radiation. In general, surrounding a bomb with denser media, such as water, absorbs more energy and creates more powerful shock waves while at the same time limiting the area of its effect. When a nuclear weapon is surrounded only by air, lethal blast and thermal effects proportionally scale much more rapidly than lethal radiation effects as explosive yield increases. This bubble is faster than the speed of sound. The physical damage mechanisms of a nuclear weapon (blast and thermal radiation) are identical to those of conventional explosives, but the energy produced by a nuclear explosion is usually millions of times more powerful per unit mass, and temperatures may briefly reach the tens of millions of degrees.\nEnergy from a nuclear explosion is initially released in several forms of penetrating radiation. When there is surrounding material such as air, rock, or water, this radiation interacts with and rapidly heats the material to an equilibrium temperature (i.e. so that the matter is at the same temperature as the fuel powering the explosion). This causes vaporization of the surrounding material, resulting in its rapid expansion. Kinetic energy created by this expansion contributes to the formation of a shock wave which expands spherically from the center. Intense thermal radiation at the hypocenter forms a nuclear fireball which, if the explosion is low enough in altitude, is often associated with a mushroom cloud. In a high-altitude burst where the density of the atmosphere is low, more energy is released as ionizing gamma radiation and X-rays than as an atmosphere-displacing shockwave.\n\n\n== Direct effects ==\n\n\n=== Blast damage ===\n\nThe high temperatures and radiation cause gas to move outward radially in a thin, dense shell called \"the hydrodynamic front\". The front acts like a piston that pushes against and compresses the surrounding medium to make a spherically expanding shock wave. At first, this shock wave is inside the surface of the developing fireball, which is created in a volume of air heated by the explosion's \"soft\" X-rays. Within a fraction of a second, the dense shock front obscures the fireball and continues to move past it, expanding outwards and free from the fireball, causing a reduction of light emanating from a nuclear detonation. Eventually the shock wave dissipates to the point where the light becomes visible again giving rise to the characteristic double flash caused by the shock wave‚Äìfireball interaction. It is this unique feature of nuclear explosions that is exploited when verifying that an atmospheric nuclear explosion has occurred and not simply a large conventional explosion, with radiometer instruments known as Bhangmeters capable of determining the nature of explosions.\nFor air bursts at or near sea level, 50‚Äì60% of the explosion's energy goes into the blast wave, depending on the size and the yield of the bomb. As a general rule, the blast fraction is higher for low yield weapons.

An explosive yield of one terajoule is equal to 0.239 kilotonnes of TNT. Because the accuracy of any measurement of the energy released by TNT has always been problematic, the conventional definition is that one kilotonne of TNT is held simply to be equivalent to 1012 calories.\nThe yield-to-weight ratio is the amount of weapon yield compared to the mass of the weapon. The practical maximum yield-to-weight ratio for fusion weapons (thermonuclear weapons) has been estimated to six megatonnes of TNT per tonne of bomb mass (25 TJ/kg). Yields of 5.2 megatonnes/tonne and higher have been reported for large weapons constructed for single-warhead use in the early 1960s. Since then, the smaller warheads needed to achieve the increased net damage efficiency (bomb damage/bomb mass) of multiple warhead systems have resulted in increases in the yield/mass ratio for single modern warheads.\n\n\n== Examples of nuclear weapon yields ==\nIn order of increasing yield (most yield figures are approximate):\n\nIn comparison, the blast yield of the GBU-43 Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb is 0.011 kt, and that of the Oklahoma City bombing, using a truck-based fertilizer bomb, was 0.002 kt. The estimated strength of the explosion at the Port of Beirut is 0.3-0.5 kt. Most artificial non-nuclear explosions are considerably smaller than even what are considered to be very small nuclear weapons.\n\n\n=== Yield limits ===\nThe yield-to-mass ratio is the amount of weapon yield compared to the mass of the weapon. The highest achieved values are somewhat lower, and the value tends to be lower for smaller, lighter weapons, of the sort that are emphasized in today's arsenals, designed for efficient MIRV use or delivery by cruise missile systems.\n\nThe 25 Mt yield option reported for the B41 would give it a yield-to-mass ratio of 5.1 megatonnes of TNT per tonne. While this would require a far greater efficiency than any other current U.S. weapon (at least 40% efficiency in a fusion fuel of lithium deuteride), this was apparently attainable, probably by the use of higher than normal lithium-6 enrichment in the lithium deuteride fusion fuel. This results in the B41 still retaining the record for the highest yield-to-mass weapon ever designed.\nThe W56 demonstrated a yield-to-mass ratio of 4.96 kt per kilogram of device mass, and very close to the predicted 5.1 kt/kg achievable in the highest yield-to-mass weapon ever built, the 25-megatonne B41. Unlike the B41, which was never proof-tested at full yield, the W56 demonstrated its efficiency in the XW-56X2 Bluestone shot of Operation Dominic in 1962, thus, from information available in the public domain, the W56 may hold the distinction of demonstrating the highest efficiency in a nuclear weapon to date.\nIn 1963 DOE declassified statements that the U.S. had the technological capability of deploying a 35 Mt warhead on the Titan II, or a 50‚Äì60 Mt gravity bomb on B-52s. Neither weapon was pursued, but either would require yield-to-mass ratios superior to a 25 Mt Mk-41.\nFor current smaller US weapons, yield is 600 to 2200 kilotonnes of TNT per tonne. By comparison, for the very small tactical devices such as the Davy Crockett it was 0.4 to 40 kilotonnes of TNT per tonne. For historical comparison, for Little Boy the yield was only 4 kilotonnes of TNT per tonne, and for the largest Tsar Bomba, the yield was 2 megatonnes of TNT per tonne (deliberately reduced from about twice as much yield for the same weapon, so there is little doubt that this bomb as designed was capable of 4 megato\nA blast shelter is a place where people can go to protect themselves from blasts and explosions, like those from bombs, or in hazardous worksites, such as on oil and gas refineries or petrochemical facilities. It differs from a fallout shelter, in that its main purpose is to protect from shock waves and overpressure instead of from radioactive precipitation, as a fallout shelter does. It is also possible for a shelter to protect from both blasts and fallout.\nBlast shelters are a vital form of protection from nuclear attacks and are employed in civil defense. There are above-ground, below-ground, dedicated, dual-purpose, and potential blast shelters. Dedicated blast shelters are built specifically for the purpose of blast protection (see bunker). Dual-purpose blast shelters are existing structures with blast-protective properties that have been modified to accommodate people seeking protection from blasts. Potential blast shelters are existing structures or geological features exhibiting blast-protective properties that have potential to be used for protection from blasts.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\nBlast shelters deflect the blast wave from nearby explosions to prevent ear and internal injuries to people sheltering in the bunker. While frame buildings collapse from as little as 3 psi (20 kPa) of overpressure, blast shelters are regularly constructed to survive several hundred psi. This substantially decreases the likelihood that a bomb can harm the structure.\nThe basic plan is to provide a structure that is very strong in compression. The actual strength specification must be done individually, based on the nature and probability of the threat. A typical specification for heavy civil defence shelter in Europe during the Cold war was an overhead explosion of a 500 kiloton weapon at the height of 500 meters. Such a weapon would be used to attack soft targets (factories, administrative centres, communications) in the area.\nOnly the most heavy bedrock-shelters would stand a chance of surviving. However, in the countryside or in a suburb, the likely distance to the explosion is much larger, as it is improbable that anyone would waste an expensive nuclear device on such targets. The most common purpose-built structure is a steel-reinforced concrete vault or arch buried or located in the basement of a house.\nMost expedient blast shelters are civil engineering structures that contain large buried tubes or pipes such as sewage or rapid transit tunnels. Even these, nonetheless, require several additions to serve properly: blast doors, air-filtration and ventilation equipment, secondary exits, and air-proofing.\nImprovised purpose-built blast shelters normally use earthen arches or vaults. To form these, a narrow (1-2 metre-wide) flexible tent of thin wood is placed in a deep trench (usually the apex of the tent is below grade), and then covered with cloth or plastic, and then covered with 1‚Äì2 meters of tamped earth. Shelters of this type are approved field expedient blast shelters of both the U.S. and China. Entrances are constructed from thick wooden frames. Blast valves are to be constructed from tire-treads laid on thick wooden grids.\nNuclear bunkers must also cope with the underpressure that lasts for several seconds after the shock wave passes, and prompt radiation. The overburden and structure provide substantial radiation shielding, and the negative pressure is usually only 1/3 of the overpressure.\nThe doors must be at least as strong as the walls. The usual design is a trap-door, to minimize the size and expense. In dual-purpose shelters, which have a secondary peacetime use, the door may be normal. To reduce the weight, the door is normally constructed of steel, with a fitted steel lintel and frame welded to the steel-reinforcement of the concrete. The shelter should be located so that there is no combustible material directly outside it.\nIf the door is on the surface and will be exposed to the blast wave, the edge of the door is normally \nHoward Jones (born July 20, 1970) is an American metalcore vocalist best known as the former lead singer of Killswitch Engage and Blood Has Been Shed. He is the current vocalist of Light the Torch, formerly known as Devil You Know, and SION with YouTuber/guitarist Jared Dines.\n\n\n== Career ==\nJones started making music in the underground band Driven in 1996, releasing a single album. He later performed with Blood Has Been Shed from 1997 to 2004. In 2002, he joined Killswitch Engage as their new vocalist after Jesse Leach left the band. During his time with Killswitch Engage, they released two gold-certified albums, The End of Heartache and As Daylight Dies, as well as a second self-titled album. Jones left the band after nearly ten years in 2012, but remained a close friend. He would go on to collaborate with them again for the single \"The Signal Fire\" from their album Atonement. His later band Light the Torch would also tour with Killswitch Engage, and he would appear with the band onstage to perform the song, as well as other songs from his time with them, often as a duet alongside Leach.\nJones started a new band Devil You Know with guitarist Francesco Artusato (All Shall Perish) and drummer John Sankey (Devolved, Fear Factory and Divine Heresy). After Sankey's departure and his attempt to claim the copyright of the band's name, the rest of the band members started again with a fresh name, Light the Torch, with the addition of a new drummer.\nIn March 2021, Jones joined with heavy metal YouTuber Jared Dines and producer Hiram Hernandez to release \"The Blade\" as part of a new project named Sion.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nJones is an avid fisherman and owns property on the Red River of the North in Manitoba, Canada. He is a frequent guest on Jamey Jasta's podcast on the GaS Digital Network. Jones left Killswitch Engage in early 2012 to allow himself to manage his type 2 diabetes, which was worsened by a hectic touring lifestyle. In 2013, Jones stated that his diabetes put him in a coma for three days.\nIn 2015, Jones revealed that he had struggled with anxiety and depression for a long time, which had been worsened by his rise to fame in Killswitch Engage. He revealed that he had come close to committing suicide in 2009, when he had aimed a .44 Magnum revolver at his head in his apartment in Connecticut, and that the police had intervened after being notified by a concerned neighbor. In 2018, he teamed up with his former band to raise awareness for mental health; the resulting song \"The Signal Fire\" appears on the 2019 album Atonement.\nJones used to be straight edge. Today, he shares a passion for medical cannabis with friend and fellow Killswitch Engage frontman Jesse Leach.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nBlood Has Been Shed\nI Dwell on Thoughts of You (September 21, 1999, Ferret Records)\nNovella of Uriel (February 20, 2001, Ferret Records)\nSpirals (March 11, 2003, Ferret Records)\nKillswitch Engage\nThe End of Heartache (May 11, 2004, Roadrunner Records)\nAs Daylight Dies (November 21, 2006, Roadrunner Records)\nKillswitch Engage (June 30, 2009, Roadrunner Records)\nLight the Torch (formerly Devil You Know)\nThe Beauty of Destruction (April 25, 2014, Nuclear Blast)\nThey Bleed Red (November 6, 2015, Nuclear Blast)\nRevival (March 30, 2018, Nuclear Blast)\nYou Will Be the Death of Me (June 25, 2021, Nuclear Blast)\nSION\nSION (November 26, 2021, Independent)\n\n\n=== Guest appearances ===\nFragment ‚Äì Answers (\"Inertia\") *First ever guest appearance\n36 Crazyfists ‚Äì Rest Inside the Flames (\"Elysium\")\nDemon Hunter ‚Äì Summer of Darkness (\"Our Faces Fall Apart\")\nEighteen Visions ‚Äì Vanity (\"One Hell of a Prize Fighter\")\nRoadrunner United ‚Äì All-Star Sessions (\"The Dagger\")\nThrowdown ‚Äì Vendetta (\"The World Behind\")\nIll Bill ‚Äì The Hour of Reprisal (\"Babylon\")\nEvery Time I Die ‚Äì Last Night in Town (\"Punch-Drunk Punk Rock Romance\")\nBeliever ‚Äì Gabriel (\"The Brave\")\nAsking Alexandria ‚Äì From Death to Destiny (\"Until the End\") *First guest appearance since leaving Killswitc\nCellar Darling are a three-piece Swiss progressive metal band from Winterthur and Lucerne, founded in 2016. The group was formed by Anna Murphy (vocals, hurdy-gurdy, flute), Merlin Sutter (drums) and Ivo Henzi (guitars and bass). Cellar Darling incorporates heavy metal, folk, classical, and progressive influences. Notably, the band uses a hurdy-gurdy and a transverse flute. The trio were previously part of the Swiss metal band Eluveitie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation ===\nIn May 2016 three longtime members of Eluveitie announced their departure from the band. Anna Murphy (singer and hurdy-gurdy player), Ivo Henzi (guitarist), and Merlin Sutter (drummer) parted ways with Eluveitie in a highly publicised split. The details of the split were not cited in the press, but speculation ensued among fans. In June 2016 the trio announced the creation of Cellar Darling. The band quickly began working on new music for their debut release.\nOn 23 September 2016 Cellar Darling launched a single called \"Challenge\" along with the B-side track \"Fire, Wind & Earth\". The single was self released and the video was created and directed by the band themselves. The musical style of the initial release was a concrete departure from the folk metal genre of their previous band. Cellar Darling played their first shows in December 2016, supporting Amorphis in Zurich, Switzerland and The Gentle Storm in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\n\n\n=== This Is The Sound and signing to Nuclear Blast ===\nIn January 2017 the trio announced their signing to German independent metal label Nuclear Blast Records, and that their debut album would be released through the label the following summer.\nIn May, it was announced that Cellar Darling's first album would be titled This Is the Sound and was to be released on 30 June 2017. A track list of the album was introduced.\nCellar Darling released their second single, \"Black Moon\", on 19 May 2017, along with a music video. This was followed on 17 June 2017 with a third single, \"Avalanche\". Both videos were shot in Tenerife.\nThe debut album was released on 30 June 2017 to widespread critical acclaim.\n\n\n=== The Spell ===\nOn 2 November 2018 \"Insomnia\" was released, accompanied by a music video created by Costin Chioreanu.\nCellar Darling's second album, The Spell, was released on 22 March 2019 on Nuclear Blast Records. The Spell is a concept album telling a story of \"an unnamed girl who is birthed into a world that is full of pain, damaged and debilitated by the human beings that inhabit it\".\n\n\n=== \"Dance\" ===\nOn 23 March 2021 the single and music video for \"Dance\" was released. Although it was originally meant to be part of The Spell, the song was rewritten in 2020 and released alongside a music video. \n\"Inspiration came from two sources: the dancing plague of 1518, which is a fascinating story in itself, and an engagement with our contemporary world: doesn't it sometimes feel like we're in the process of dancing ourselves to death?\"\n\n\n== Members ==\nAnna Murphy ‚Äì lead vocals, hurdy-gurdy, flute, keyboards (2016‚Äìpresent)\nIvo Henzi ‚Äì guitars, bass (2016‚Äìpresent)\nMerlin Sutter ‚Äì drums (2016‚Äìpresent)\n\n\n=== Live musicians ===\nNicolas Winter ‚Äì bass (2017‚Äìpresent)\nRafi Kirder ‚Äì bass (2016)\nRachel G ‚Äì bass (U.S. tour 2022)\n\n\n=== Guest musicians ===\nShir-Ran Yinon ‚Äì violin (2016‚Äì2018)\nBrendan Wade ‚Äì uilleann pipes (2016‚Äì2017)\nFredy Schnyder ‚Äì piano (2016‚Äì2017)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nThis Is the Sound (2017)\nThe Spell (2019)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Challenge\" - 2016\n\"Avalanche\" - 2017\n\"Black Moon\" - 2017\n\"Insomnia\" - 2018\n\"Dance\" - 2021\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\nChallenge\nBlack Moon\nAvalanche\nSix days\nInsomnia\nThe Spell\nDeath\nDrown\nDance\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nCradle of Filth are an English extreme metal band formed in Suffolk in 1991. The band's musical style evolved originally from black metal to a cleaner and more \"produced\" amalgam of gothic metal, symphonic metal and other metal genres. Their lyrical themes and imagery are heavily influenced by Gothic literature, poetry, mythology and horror films. The band consists of its founding member, vocalist Dani Filth, drummer Martin \"Marthus\" ≈†karoupka, bassist Daniel Firth, guitarists Marek \"Ashok\" ≈†merda and Donny Burbage, and keyboardist Zoe Marie Federoff.\nThe band has broken free from its original niche by courting mainstream publicity. This increased accessibility has brought coverage from the likes of Kerrang! and MTV, along with frequent main stage appearances at major festivals such as Ozzfest, Download and even the mainstream Sziget Festival. They have sometimes been perceived as Satanic by casual observers, even though their outright lyrical references to Satanism are few and far between; their use of Satanic imagery has arguably always been more for shock value than any seriously held beliefs.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years (1991‚Äì1996) ===\n\nCradle of Filth's first three years saw three demos (Invoking the Unclean, Orgiastic Pleasures Foul and Total Fucking Darkness) recorded amidst the sort of rapid line-up fluctuations that have continued ever since, with the band having more than thirty musicians in its history. An album entitled Goetia was recorded prior to the third demo and set for release on Tombstone Records, but all tracks were wiped when Tombstone went out of business and the band could not afford to buy the recordings from the studio. The band eventually signed to Cacophonous Records, and their debut album, The Principle of Evil Made Flesh, was Cacophonous's first release in 1994. A step-up in terms of production from the rehearsal quality of most of their demos, the album was still nevertheless a sparse and embryonic version of what was to come, with lead singer Dani Filth's vocals in particular bearing little similarity to the style he was later to develop. The album was well-received however, and as recently as June 2006 found its way into Metal Hammer's list of the top ten black metal albums of the last twenty years.\nCradle's relationship with Cacophonous soon soured, the band accusing the label of contractual and financial mismanagement. Acrimonious legal proceedings took up most of 1995, and the original version of the band's second album, Dusk... and Her Embrace was recorded by the Principle... lineup for Cacophonous but scrapped. Subsequently re-worked with new band members for Music For Nations (see below), the embryonic Cacophonous version was eventually released as Dusk... and Her Embrace: The Original Sin in July 2016.\nThe band finally signed to Music for Nations in 1996 after only one more contractually obligated Cacophonous recording: the EP V Empire or Dark Faerytales in Phallustein, which, it has since been conceded, was hastily written as a Cacophonous escape-plan. Despite the circumstances of its release however, its handful of tracks are staples of the band's live sets to this day, and \"Queen of Winter, Throned\" was listed among twenty-five \"essential extreme metal anthems\" in a 2006 issue of Kerrang! magazine. The EP also marked Sarah Jezebel Deva's debut with the band, replacing Andrea Meyer, Cradle's first female vocalist and self-styled \"satanic advisor\". Deva appeared on every subsequent Cradle release and tour until 2010's Darkly, Darkly, Venus Aversa, but was never considered a full band member, since she also performed with The Kovenant, Therion and Mortiis, and fronted her own Angtoria project along with Cradle's former bass guitar player, Dave Pybus.\n\n\n=== Music for Nations era (1996‚Äì2001) ===\nThe re-worked and re-recorded Dusk... and Her Embrace followed the same year: a critically acclaimed breakthrough album that greatly expanded the band's fan-base throughout Europe and the rest\nDownset (usually stylized as downset.) is an American rap metal band from Los Angeles, California. Originally called Social Justice, the band's music blends influences from rap, funk, hardcore punk, and metal with \"socially aware lyrics.\"\n\n\n== Band history ==\n\n\n=== Formation and early releases (1989‚Äì1993) ===\nThe band's original moniker was Social Justice. They began as a hardcore punk band. They released their debut album, Unity Is Strength, in 1989 and the EP I Refuse to Lose under this name with a different lineup in 1992. They were known as being one of the first hardcore bands to incorporate hip hop and funk influences into their music.\nIn 1992, Social Justice changed their name to Downset, and released the Our Suffocation demo in 1993. The album, which explored various social issues such as the death of lead singer Rey Oropeza's father at the hands of the LAPD, was praised by critics. During this transition, they changed their sound by heavily incorporating rap metal and funk metal.\n\n\n=== Mercury Records, downset. and Do We Speak a Dead Language? (1994‚Äì1998) ===\n\nIn 1994, Downset signed a deal with Mercury Records, a subsidiary of PolyGram, and released their self-titled effort in the same year. In 1994, downset began gaining popularity in Europe after touring there with Biohazard and Dog Eat Dog, followed by a tour with Pantera and The Almighty later that year. In early 1995, Downset returned to Europe with Sullen for a massive headlining tour. In 1995, they also appeared at some major rock festivals throughout the continent including Roskilde and Dynamo. In 1996, the band released their most commercially successful album, Do We Speak a Dead Language?, through Mercury.\n\n\n=== Post-Mercury years, Check Your People and Universal (1998‚Äì2009) ===\nAfter making their departure from Mercury Records, Downset were scooped up by Epitaph Records and released their third album, Check Your People, in 2000. In 2004, Downset released their fourth album, Universal, on an independent record label Hawino Records. In recognition of the band's album release on Epitaph Records, \"Pure Trauma\", taken from the album Check Your People, was included on the 2001 multi-artist compilation Punk-O-Rama Vol. 6. The band disbanded in 2009.\n\n\n=== Reunion and One Blood (2013‚Äì2014) ===\nOn July 21, 2014, Downset's first new album in ten years, One Blood, was released worldwide.\n\n\n=== Signing to Nuclear Blast and Maintain (2022) ===\nAfter a period of prolonged inactivity, Downset announced in February 2022 that they had signed to Nuclear Blast Records, and announced plans for a new studio album as well as reissues of their demo singles \"Anger/Ritual\" and \"About Ta Blast\". On April 29, the band announced their new album, Maintain, would be released on June 10, 2022, and released the album's first single, \"The Place to Be\". The album sold 200 copies in its first week of sales.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThough Downset never experienced any mainstream success, and though its members came from an urban hardcore tradition rather than from metal, the band is still regarded as a noteworthy influence on the then-nascent nu metal and rap metal subgenres. In addition to headlining the second stage at Ozzfest in 1997, downset. toured with prominent bands such as Linkin Park, Pantera, Slayer, Metallica, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Korn, Snoop Dogg, Testament and Anthrax.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent\n\nNeil Roemer ‚Äì vocals (2023‚Äìpresent)\nRogelio Lozano ‚Äì guitar (1989‚Äì1994, 1999‚Äì2002, 2013, 2019‚Äìpresent)\nPhillip Gonzales ‚Äì bass guitar (2019‚Äìpresent)\nBobby Blood ‚Äì drums (2019‚Äìpresent)\nFormer members\n\nRey Oropeza ‚Äì vocals (1989‚Äì2023)\nBrian \"Ares\" Schwager ‚Äì guitar (1989‚Äì2016)\nChristopher \"Krasp\" Lee ‚Äì drums (1989‚Äì1999, 2001‚Äì2005, 2013)\nChris Hamilton ‚Äì drums (1999‚Äì2001, 2014‚Äì2019)\nJames Morris ‚Äì bass guitar (1989‚Äì2003, 2014‚Äì2019)\nRico Villasenor ‚Äì bass guitar (2003‚Äì2005)\nNeil Roemer ‚Äì vocals (2013)\nJohnathan Manhart ‚Äì bass guitar (2013)\nFormer touring musicians\n\nNeil Roemer ‚Äì vocals (2013)\nJ\nThe discography of In Flames, a Swedish heavy metal band formed in the early 1990s, consists of fourteen studio albums, two live album, eight extended plays, thirty-one singles, two video albums, and forty-six music videos. Signed with Wrong Again Records, In Flames released their full-length debut, Lunar Strain (1994), followed by the EP Subterranean (1995). After signing to Nuclear Blast, they released The Jester Race (1996). The following year, they issued their second EP, Black-Ash Inheritance, and the full-length album Whoracle. The band's fourth studio album, Colony (1999), reached the top 30 in Sweden and Finland. Clayman followed in the same vein the next year, reaching the top 20 in the same countries. The tour to promote it was released as The Tokyo Showdown (2001) live album, which also charted in Sweden and Finland, breaking the top 40. Reroute to Remain (2002) peaked at number 5 on the Swedish and Finnish charts, and number 10 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart. The album was accompanied by the band's first single, \"Cloud Connected\", which failed to chart.\nIn 2003, In Flames released Trigger, an EP that features the title track backed with a remix, a cover of Genesis' \"Land of Confusion\", and two music videos. It was followed by Soundtrack to Your Escape in 2004, which peaked at number 3 in Sweden, and number 7 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart. The album produced a single for \"The Quiet Place\", which followed the success of the album and reached number 2 in their home country. Used & Abused: In Live We Trust (2005), was the band's debut video album, and their first release to top the Swedish chart. Following the same blueprint, Come Clarity (2006) topped the Finnish and Swedish charts, and reached number 2 on the Billboard Top Independent Albums, number 6 in Germany, as well as the top 30 in three additional European countries. The album was backed by the single \"Come Clarity\", which was released in a limited edition that reached number 52 in their home country. Before they released their ninth studio album, In Flames issued the single \"The Mirror's Truth\", which peaked at number 5 in Finland. Their ninth studio album, A Sense of Purpose (2008), topped the Swedish and Billboard Independent Albums charts, and reached top 10 in Austria, Finland, and Germany. In Flames were featured on Pendulum's 2010 album Immersion, on a song called \"Self vs Self\". In Flames signed with Century Media after completing their recording contract with Nuclear Blast in 2011. Sounds of a Playground Fading was then issued as the band's tenth studio album, peaking at number 1 in Germany. It debuted and peaked at number 27 on the Billboard 200, becoming their highest-charting album in the United States, with a single, \"Where the Dead Ships Dwell\", reaching number 35 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. As of 2011, In Flames have sold over 2.5 million albums worldwide.\n\n\n== Albums ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n== Extended plays ==\n\n\n== Singles ==\n\n\n== Videos ==\n\n\n=== Video albums ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nGeneral\n\nSpecific\n\n\n== External links ==\nIn Flames at AllMusic\nIn Flames discography at Discogs\nRoger Tiegs (born 18 June 1972 in Ume√•), better known by his stage name Infernus, is a Norwegian black metal musician and Satanist. He is the sole founding member and chief ideologist of the black metal band Gorgoroth, formed in 1992, in addition to being the founder and head of Forces of Satan Records. While mainly a guitarist, Infernus has also participated as bassist, drummer and vocalist on several recordings released both by Gorgoroth and other bands.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== The formation of Gorgoroth ===\nInfernus founded the black metal band Gorgoroth in Sunnfjord in 1992 after allegedly making \"a pact with the Devil\". The first Gorgoroth demo, A Sorcery Written in Blood, was released in 1993, and led the band to acquiring a record deal with French label Embassy Productions. The first full-length Gorgoroth album, Pentagram, was released in 1994. In the following years, the band experienced several line-up changes, with Infernus being the sole original member to continue in the band. Joining members of black metal bands such as Ulver, Immortal, Enslaved, and Molested, Infernus participated as bassist on Borknagar's self-titled debut album, released in 1996. After signing a deal with German label Malicious Records, Gorgoroth released the albums Antichrist in 1996 and Under the Sign of Hell in1997, with Infernus writing all the music and the majority of the lyrics, in addition to performing both guitar and bass duties on the albums.\n\n\n=== Gorgoroth tenure with Nuclear Blast ===\nAfter the release of Under the Sign of Hell and a European headlining tour in 1997, Gorgoroth was signed by the major German metal label Nuclear Blast. In 1998, Infernus and Gorgoroth-guitarist Tormentor, who had joined the band in 1996, released an album as black metal side project called Desekrator, which also included members of Enslaved and Old Funeral. Infernus wrote the majority of the first two Gorgoroth albums released on Nuclear Blast, Destroyer (1998), and Incipit Satan (2000), while Tormentor, wrote the albums' title tracks. After performing live with Gorgoroth on several festivals and tours both in Europe and South America, Infernus became one of the founding members of the black metal band Orcustus in 2002, a band consisting of members and ex-members of Gorgoroth, Gehenna, and Enslaved. Twilight of the Idols - In Conspiracy with Satan, Gorgoroth's third release on Nuclear Blast, was released in 2003.\n\n\n=== Rape conviction ===\nIn 2003, Infernus was accused of repeatedly raping a woman for hours with a friend at an after-party in his apartment. He was initially sentenced to three years in prison in 2005, but appealed the sentence and was acquitted of rape but convicted of gross negligent rape and sentenced to one year in prison. He served four months in prison in the winter of 2006 and 2007 before being released on parole.\n\n\n=== Gorgoroth controversy in Krak√≥w and transfer to Regain Records ===\nOn 1 February 2004, Infernus and Gorgoroth performed a live show in Krak√≥w, meant to be released on a video album by Metal Mind Productions. Due to the satanic nature of the live show, which featured sheep heads on stakes, \"crucified\" nude models, satanic symbols and eighty litres of sheep's blood, the band and video producers were accused of breaking the Polish blasphemy laws. The tapes from the concert were confiscated by the Polish police for 4 years, but the concert was finally released on DVD in the summer of 2008 as Black Mass Krakow 2004. In 2005, Infernus and Tormentor, who had quit Gorgoroth in 2002, released a cover version of Von's \"Satanic Blood\" under the name Norwegian Evil. After leaving Nuclear Blast in 2004, Infernus and Gorgoroth signed on Swedish record label Regain Records, which released the next Gorgoroth album, Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam, in 2006.\n\n\n=== Forces of Satan Records ===\nOn 6 June 2006 Infernus started his own record label, Forces of Satan Records, dedicated to only releasing albums by bands with a \"clear-cut Satani\nDismember is a Swedish death metal band formed in 1988. They split up in 2011 but reunited in 2019. Pioneers of Swedish death metal, Dismember is now considered one of the country's \"big four\", alongside Entombed, Grave, and Unleashed.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and Nuclear Blast-era (1988‚Äì2002) ===\nThe band formed in Stockholm in 1988. After a hiatus, during which several members joined Carnage, the band began recording in earnest in 1991 and released their debut album Like an Ever Flowing Stream that year. The album is today heralded as a milestone for the burgeoning Swedish death metal scene and established the band's fanbase, which was further bolstered by the controversy surrounding one song in particular, \"Skin Her Alive\". The song prompted an obscenity charge in the United Kingdom, against which the band successfully defended themselves.\nIn 1992, Dismember released the Pieces EP, and the following year continued with second album, Indecent & Obscene, which featured their song \"Dreaming in Red\"; the \"Dreaming in Red\" videoclip was shown in MTV's Headbangers Ball. According to an interview with fellow Nuclear Blast group Benediction in metallian.com, Dismember and the said band got into a business dispute and eventually a fisticuff at this stage over tour arrangements and monies owed.\nLike many of the other Scandinavian death metal bands, Dismember began softening their sound in the mid-1990s, with 1995's Massive Killing Capacity having more melodic approaches, which had a good public response. Nevertheless, they attempted a return to style with 1997's Death Metal, which ultimately became a sales disappointment. Their last album for Nuclear Blast was 2000's Hate Campaign.\n\n\n=== Switching labels (2003‚Äì2006) ===\nAround 2003, Dismember set a new path and signed for Karmageddon Records. In 2004, they released their sole album with that label titled Where Ironcrosses Grow which some thought sounds close to Hate Campaign and was inspired by Iron Maiden and Autopsy.\nThey switched record companies again in 2005, signing to Regain Records, which bought the rights to their earlier albums as well and released them as luxury digipak editions. In 2006, Dismember released their seventh album The God That Never Was, which continued in the style of its predecessor. The band spent February on the road in Europe. In November 2006, Dismember toured Europe as part of the Masters of Death tour, with Grave, Unleashed, Entombed, and Exterminator.\n\n\n=== Split with Fred Estby and final album (2007‚Äì2010) ===\nAfter the release of The God That Never Was and some touring, Estby left the band \"after long and careful consideration\". In a posting on the official site on 20 April 2007, Estby cites the demands of touring and the needs of his family as key reasons for him leaving the band. His statements appears as \"My decision to put my family in first hand makes it impossible to keep on touring and commit to the band full time. I want to thank all the fans, friends, bands and all the other cool people I've met through the years and I wish Dismember all the best in the future. Fred.\"\nIn April 2008, they released their eighth album, Dismember.\nDismember released a two-disc DVD titled Under Blood Red Skies in late July 2009. The live concerts were filmed in the Netherlands and at the 2008 Party San Open Air Festival in Bad Berka, Germany. The DVD also included a documentary and interviews with band members. The cover art was created by Erik Danielsson of Trident Art.\n\n\n=== Breakup and reunion (2011‚Äìpresent) ===\nOn 16 October 2011, bassist Tobias Cristiansson revealed in a statement that Dismember had broken up: \"After 23 years, Dismember have now decided to quit. We wish to thank all our fans for your support.\"\nOn a possible reunion, drummer Fred Estby told Invisible Oranges in August 2016: \"People were telling me that all the time. So maybe we should try to do some shows and get everything back. We always owned our rights to the albums and shirts, but\nA nuclear holocaust, also known as a nuclear apocalypse, nuclear annihilation, nuclear armageddon, or atomic holocaust, is a theoretical scenario where the mass detonation of nuclear weapons causes widespread destruction and radioactive fallout. Such a scenario envisages large parts of the Earth becoming uninhabitable due to the effects of nuclear warfare, potentially causing the collapse of civilization, the extinction of humanity, and/or the termination of most biological life on Earth. \nBesides the immediate destruction of cities by nuclear blasts, the potential aftermath of a nuclear war could involve firestorms, a nuclear winter, widespread radiation sickness from fallout, and/or the temporary (if not permanent) loss of much modern technology due to electromagnetic pulses. Some scientists, such as Alan Robock, have speculated that a thermonuclear war could result in the end of modern civilization on Earth, in part due to a long-lasting nuclear winter. In one model, the average temperature of Earth following a full thermonuclear war falls for several years by 7 ‚Äì 8 ¬∞C (13 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit) on average.\nEarly Cold War-era studies suggested that billions of humans would survive the immediate effects of nuclear blasts and radiation following a global thermonuclear war. The International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War believe that nuclear war could indirectly contribute to human extinction via secondary effects, including environmental consequences, societal breakdown, and economic collapse.\nThe threat of a nuclear holocaust plays an important role in the anti-nuclear movement and the development of popular perception of nuclear weapons. It features in the security concept of mutually assured destruction (MAD) and is a common scenario in survivalism. Nuclear holocaust is a common feature in literature and film, especially in speculative genres such as science fiction, dystopian and post-apocalyptic fiction.\n\n\n== Etymology and usage ==\nThe English word \"holocaust\", derived from the Greek term \"holokaustos\" meaning \"completely burnt\", refers to great destruction and loss of life, especially by fire.\nOne early use of the word \"holocaust\" to describe an imagined nuclear destruction appears in Reginald Glossop's 1926 novel The Orphan of Space: \"Moscow ... beneath them  ... a crash like a crack of Doom! The echoes of this Holocaust rumbled and rolled ... a distinct smell of sulphur ... atomic destruction.\" In the novel, an atomic weapon is planted in the office of the Soviet dictator, who, with German help and Chinese mercenaries, is preparing the takeover of Western Europe.\n\n\n== Likelihood of nuclear war ==\n\nAs of 2021, humanity has about 13,410 nuclear weapons, thousands of which are on hair-trigger alert. While stockpiles have been on the decline following the end of the Cold War, every nuclear country is currently undergoing modernization of its nuclear arsenal. The Bulletin advanced their symbolic Doomsday Clock in 2015, citing among other factors \"a nuclear arms race resulting from modernization of huge arsenals\". In January 2020, it was moved forward to 100 seconds before midnight. In 2023, it was moved forward to 90 seconds before midnight.\nJohn F. Kennedy estimated the probability of the Cuban Missile Crisis escalating to nuclear conflict as between 33% and 50%.\nIn a poll of experts at the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference in Oxford (17‚Äì20 July 2008), the Future of Humanity Institute estimated the probability of complete human extinction by nuclear weapons at 1% within the century, the probability of 1 billion dead at 10% and the probability of 1 million dead at 30%. These results reflect the median opinions of a group of experts, rather than a probabilistic model; the actual values may be much lower or higher.\nScientists have argued that even a small-scale nuclear war between two countries, such as India and Pakistan, could have devastating global consequences and such local conflicts are more likely\nBurning Witches is a Swiss heavy/power metal band, founded by rhythm guitarist Romana Kalkuhl, based in Brugg, Aargau.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and self-titled debut ===\nRomana Kalkuhl, guitarist with Atlas & Axis, had been looking for a cast for an all-female metal band for a long time. Over the years, she got to know different musicians and finally found the first cast with bassist Jeanine Grob, drummer Lala Frischknecht and lead singer Seraina Telli. In 2016, guitarist Alea Wyss completed the lineup. First came a self-titled single, which was also the band's first demo. This was voted \"Demo of the Month\" in both Rock Hard and Metal Hammer.\nIn 2017, Burning Witches released their self-titled debut album in-house, directed by V.O. Pulver (Poltergeist, Gurd) and Marcel \"Schmier\" Schirmer (Destruction). The album was distributed through the crowdfunding platform Pledge Music. With the song Jawbreaker, the album contains a cover version of a song by Judas Priest. The album reached number 73 in the Swiss album charts. Shortly after the release, Burning Witches began songwriting for their next album. On 14 February 2018, Nuclear Blast announced they had signed the band.\n\n\n=== Hexenhammer and Dance with the Devil ===\nIn the meantime, Wyss was replaced by Sonia 'Anubis' Nusselder from the Netherlands. A tour as the opening act for Grave Digger followed. A first album trailer was released on 12 September 2018. Three digital singles followed. The album Hexenhammer was released on 9 November 2018. It is not a concept album in the strict sense, although the book of the same name plays a role in some songs. With Holy Diver by the band Dio there is again a cover version on the album. The album reached number 43 in the German album charts and number 21 in Switzerland. In June 2019, singer Seraina Telli left the band to focus on her own band, Dead Venus. She was succeeded by Dutch singer Laura Guldemond from the band Shadowrise. \nIn the Summer of 2019, Burning Witches played at the Wacken, Summer Breeze and Rockharz Open Air festivals. The album Dance with the Devil, produced by Pulver and Schirmer, was released on 6 March 2020. The album features a cover version of the Manowar song Battle Hymn, which features guest musicians Ross the Boss and Michael Lepond. Dance with the Devil entered the German and Swiss album charts at number 22 and 14 respectively. A few months later, Nusselder left the band after founding the death metal band Crypta with former Nervosa musicians Fernanda Lira and Luana Dametto. Larissa Ernst then took over as lead guitarist.\n\n\n=== The Witch of the North ===\nOn 4 December, the band released The Circle of Five EP before recording their fourth studio album, The Witch of the North. The album was again produced by Schirmer and mixed and mastered by V.O. Powder. The album was released on 28 May 2021. The album entered the German and Swiss album charts at number 16 and 6 respectively. In February 2022, the band signed a new record deal with the Austrian record label Napalm Records. Their first tour of the United States with The Iron Maidens occurred in 2022.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nBurning Witches is mainly influenced by the heavy metal of the 1980s, while the musicians also listen to other music. Among other things, Sonia 'Anubis' Nusselder also played in the death metal band Sephiroth. Nusselder is currently the lead guitarist of the band Cobra Spell . Musically, the band is reminiscent of Iron Maiden, Alice Cooper and Judas Priest.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\tBurning Witches, current lineup live at Rock & Metal Day'z 2024 at Motorsport Arena Oschersleben\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n2018: Burning Alive (Live-EP, Self-produced)\n2019: Wings of Steel (12\"-EP, Nuclear Blast)\n2020: The Circle of Five (EP, Nuclear Blast)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n2016: Burning Witches (Demo 2016, Self-produced)\n2018: Hexenhammer (Nuclear Bl\nFit for an Autopsy is an American deathcore band from Jersey City, New Jersey, formed in 2008.

Fellow rock musician Liselotte Hegt wrote that \"Zora is almost like a siren, luring you into dark romantic scenarios, twisted fairy tales and ghostlike sceneries\", and found that the orchestral elements on the album were present but not overpowering.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent line-up\nZora Cock ‚Äì vocals (2012‚Äìpresent)\nRen√© Boxem ‚Äì drums (2012‚Äìpresent)\nBart Winters ‚Äì lead guitar (2012‚Äìpresent)\nRobin Koezen ‚Äì rhythm guitar (2016‚Äìpresent)\nRuben Wijga ‚Äì keyboards (2019‚Äìpresent)\nSiebe Sol Sijpkens ‚Äì bass (2022‚Äìpresent, live 2021)\nPrevious members\nRen√© Sempel ‚Äì rhythm guitar (2012‚Äì2016)\nFrank Akkerman ‚Äì bass (2012‚Äì2022)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nThe Cause of Shipwreck (2021)\nA Dark Euphony (2023)\nEPs\n\nFractured Fairytales (2017)\nWe'd Rather Burn (2018)\nOur Mortal Remains(2019)\nSingles\n\n\"Ready to Kill\" (2014)\n\"Until Eternity\" (2015)\n\"Preserved Roses\" (2017)\n\"Snow White and Rose Red\" (2019; featuring Ulli Perhonen)\n\"Mortal Remains\" (2019)\n\"The S√©ance\" (2021)\n\"Deadly Diminuendo\" (2021)\n\"Selkie\" (2021)\n\"Walking Over My Grave\" (2021)\n\"Fairy of the Bog\" (2021)\n\"Crimson Faces\" (2022)\n\"My Soul's Demise\" (2023)\n\"Cicada\" (2023)\n\"Forever and a Day\" (2023)\n\"Spirit of Forgetfulness\" (2023)\n\"Moonflower\" (2024; featuring Marjana Semkina)\n\n\n== Videography ==\n\"Ready to Kill\" Directed by Michel Berendsen\n\"Until Eternity\" Directed by Joshua Maldonado\n\"I'd Rather Burn\" Directed by Blackbriar\n\"Arms of the Ocean\" Directed by Joshua Maldonado\n\"Snow White and Rose Red\"\n\"Mortal Remains\"\n\"Beautiful Delirium\"\n\"The S√©ance\" Directed by Joshua Maldonado\n\"Selkie\"\n\"Walking Over My Grave\" Directed by Joshua Maldonado\n\"Weakness and Lust\" Directed by Blackbriar\n\"You're Haunting Me\"\n\"Fairy of the Bog\" Directed by Joshua Maldonado\n\"Crimson Faces\" Directed by Joshua Maldonado\n\"My Soul's Demise\" Directed by Joshua Maldonado\n\"Cicada\" Directed by Blackbriar\n\"Spirit of Forgetfulness\" Directed by blksm media\n\"Moonflower (feat.

Formed in Solingen in 1976, Accept originally consisted of lead vocalist Udo Dirkschneider, lead guitarist Wolf Hoffmann, rhythm guitarist Gerard Wahl (later replaced by J√∂rg Fischer), bassist Peter Baltes and drummer Frank Friedrich. The band signed to Brain Records and released their self-titled debut album in 1979, which failed to chart. After Friedrich was replaced by Stefan Kaufmann, I'm a Rebel, Breaker and Restless and Wild (the group's first release after Fischer's departure) followed over the next three years, the last of which gave Accept their debut on the UK Albums Chart when it reached number 98.\nThe band signed with RCA Records and released Balls to the Wall in 1983, their first album with Fischer's replacement Herman Frank. It was the band's first domestic success, registering at number 59 on the German Albums Chart. The album also charted in the United States and Canada, receiving gold certifications in both regions. With Fischer later returning, the band's commercial recognition increased with their next two releases, as Metal Heart and Russian Roulette gave Accept their first German top 20 and top 10 chart positions, respectively. Dirkschneider was fired in 1987, but the band (with David Reece and without Fischer again) returned in 1989 with Eat the Heat, which peaked at number 15 in Germany. After a final touring cycle, Accept broke up in late 1989.\nReuniting with Dirkschneider, Accept returned in 1992 to record their comeback album Objection Overruled. Released the following year, it reached number 17 on the German Albums Chart. The group's popularity began to reduce in the 1990s, however, as 1994's Death Row peaked at number 32 and 1996's Predator peaked at number 56. Again, the band broke up in 1997. After a brief touring cycle in 2005, Accept reformed in 2009 with Hoffmann, Baltes, Frank joined by returning drummer Stefan Schwarzmann and new vocalist Mark Tornillo. Signed to Nuclear Blast, the band peaked at number 4 with 2010's Blood of the Nations and number 6 with 2012's Stalingrad: Brothers in Death, before achieving their first German Albums Chart number one with Blind Rage, released in 2014.\nAccept parted ways with Frank and Schwarzmann in 2014, with their places taken in April 2015 by Uwe Lulis and Christopher Williams, respectively. In 2017 the band reached number 9 in Germany with the live album Restless and Live: Blind Rage Live in Europe 2015, before issuing The Rise of Chaos later in the year and reaching the top three. Another live release, Symphonic Terror: Live at Wacken 2017, also reached the German Albums Chart top 20 in 2018.\n\n\n== Albums ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\n\n\n== Singles ==\n\n\n== Videos ==\n\n\n=== Video albums ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAccept official website\nMeshuggah is a Swedish extreme metal band formed in 1987 in Ume√•.

The art produced in his work with Green Lung is inspired by Well's own linocut art style and evokes the same folklore and horror themes as their lyrics.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nWoodland Rites (2019)\nBlack Harvest (2021)\nThis Heathen Land (2023)\nEP\n\nFree the Witch (2018)\nDemo\n\nGreen Man Rising (2017)\nSingles\n\n\"Lady Lucifer\" (2018)\n\"Let the Devil In\" (2019)\n\"Leaders of the Blind\" (2021)\n\"Reaper's Scythe\" (2021)\n\"Graveyard Sun\" (2021)\n\"Upon the Altar\" (2021)\n\"Mountain Throne\" (2023)\n\"Maxine (Witch Queen)\" (2023)\n\"One for Sorrow\" (2023)\n\n\n== References ==\nVenom Inc. are a British heavy metal band from Newcastle upon Tyne. Formed in 2015, the band features former Venom members Jeffrey \"Mantas\" Dunn, Tony \"Demolition Man\" Dolan and previously Anthony \"Abaddon\" Bray. Bray was replaced by Jeramie \"War Machine\" Kling in 2018, who was replaced by Marc \"JXN\" Jackson in 2024. The group has released two studio albums.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of Venom Inc. goes back to April 2015, when the band Mpire of Evil (with former Venom members Jeffrey Dunn and Tony Dolan) played at Keep It True festival in Germany. At the gig, Dunn and Dolan invited drummer Anthony \"Abaddon\" Bray, another former Venom member, to play a few old Venom songs at the festival, although Dunn and Bray had not spoken to each other for around 20 years. This spontaneous action led to the formation of Venom Inc., which consisted of the Venom line-up from 1989 to 1992:  Dunn as guitarist, Dolan as singer and bassist and Bray as drummer. \nThe group's debut album, Av√©, was released in August 2017 by Nuclear Blast. \"Dein Fleisch\" and \"Ave Satanas\" were released as singles. In the same year, the band performed at MetalDays, among others. At the end of April 2018, Dunn suffered a heart attack, which resulted in a brief cardiac arrest. He underwent double bypass surgery and has since recovered. The band later revealed that Bray did not actually play drums on Av√© and that they used a drum machine instead.\nBray took a break from band activities in early 2018 due to the birth of his daughter. However, in September 2018, he announced that he would not be returning to the band. During his break, he had learned that he had been fired and Jeramie Kling would now be the band's new drummer.\nThe band released their second studio album, There's Only Black, in September 2022. \nIn November 2023, Kling parted ways with the band due to \"logistical reasons\". He was replaced by Marc \"JXN\" Jackson in April 2024, previously of associated act Mpire of Evil.\nIn April 2024, Jeffrey Dunn suffered a second heart attack and is in recovery. Stepping in for tour duties is ex-Annihilator, ex-Nevermore and current 72 Legions guitar player Curran \"Beleth\" Murphy.  \n\n\n== Musical style ==\nIn a 2017 Rock Hard interview, Tony Dolan stated that Venom Inc. was more than just a cover band, and that they want to experiment and surprise with songs like \"Dein Fleisch\". In the same issue, Thomas Kupfer reviewed Av√©, stating that the album is not for \"music snobs\", but offers \"rowdy noise orgies\". Stephan M√∂ller from Metal.de also reviewed the album and stated that it can be categorised somewhere between the first wave of black metal as well as speed metal and thrash metal. This brought the term \"black 'n' roll\" and a Mot√∂rhead comparison to his mind. Compared to the Venom albums Black Metal and Welcome to Hell, Venom Inc. sounds a little \"rockier\" and more like Mot√∂rhead. The music also has a more modern feel. Av√© is \"mature and probably the cleanest album that this constellation of musicians has ever recorded\". \n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nJeffrey \"Mantas\" Dunn ‚Äì guitars, backing vocals (2015‚Äìpresent)\nTony \"Demolition Man\" Dolan ‚Äì bass, lead vocals (2015‚Äìpresent)\nMarc \"JXN\" Jackson ‚Äì drums (2024‚Äìpresent)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nAnthony \"Abaddon\" Bray ‚Äì drums (2015‚Äì2018)\nJeramie \"War Machine\" Kling ‚Äì drums (2018‚Äì2023)\n\n\n=== Touring members ===\nNick Barker ‚Äì drums (2022)\nMike \"Mykvs\" Hickey ‚Äì guitars (2023)\nCurran \"Beleth\" Murphy ‚Äì guitars (2024‚Äìpresent)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n2017: Av√© (Nuclear Blast)\n2022: There's Only Black (Nuclear Blast)\nSingles\n2017: \"Dein Fleisch\" (Decibel Flexi Series)\n2018: \"War\" (Nuclear Blast)\n2022: \"How Many Can Die\" (Nuclear Blast)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \nVenom Inc. at AllMusic \nVenom Inc. discography at Discogs\nThe following is the complete discography of the German thrash metal band Kreator.\n\n\n== Albums ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n\n\n=== Video albums ===\n\n\n== EPs ==\n\n\n== Singles ==\n\n\n== Music videos ==\n\n\n== References ==\nGorgoroth is a Norwegian black metal band based in Bergen. It was formed in 1992 by guitarist Infernus, who is the sole original member remaining, and has released nine studio albums. Gorgoroth are a Satanic band and have drawn controversy due to some of their concerts, which have featured impaled sheep heads and mock crucifixions. The band is named after the dead plateau of darkness in the land of Mordor from J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years (1992‚Äì1995) ===\n\nGorgoroth was founded in 1992 by guitarist Infernus. In 1993, the band released their first demo, entitled A Sorcery Written in Blood. On 7 January 1994, Firda, the major newspaper in the county of Sogn og Fjordane where the band originated from, ran a cover story on the demo, with the headline \"Local music with Satanic symbolism\". According to the article, the release of the demo and flyers with Satanic symbols led to \"concerned parents contacting the Sheriff's Office in Fjaler\". After the demo was released, Gorgoroth signed a record deal with Embassy Productions and started work on their debut full-length Pentagram. When bassist Kjettar left the band in 1993, Samoth of Emperor joined Gorgoroth as their new bassist, and participated in the recording of the album. After Pentagram was completed and released in 1994, drummer Goat left the band and was replaced by Frost from Satyricon. The band performed their first concert at Lusa Lottes P√∏bb in Oslo on 3 May 1994 at a four-day Black Metal Nights festival with bands such as Dark Funeral (who also made their live debut), Dissection, Enslaved, Marduk (who played their first gig abroad), Gehenna and Hades Almighty.\nThis was followed by gigs with Enslaved in Bergen (in June and September) and in Haugesund (in November), and the band performed their first gig abroad in Annaberg-Buchholz in Germany on 10 December 1994. The same year, the band commenced the recording of Antichrist (originally titled D√∏d), their second full-length album.\n\n\n=== With Pest (1995‚Äì1997) ===\n\nVocalist Hat decided to leave Gorgoroth in September 1995, but agreed to finish recording the vocal tracks for Antichrist. After Hat left, Infernus recruited vocalist Pest from Obtained Enslavement as Gorgoroth's new vocalist. In December 1995, the band supported Cradle of Filth at the London Astoria, a show which also included the band Primordial. This marked the first Gorgoroth live appearance of both vocalist Pest and bassist Ares. In 1995 the band had been offered a record deal with Moonfog Productions, but this offer was rejected in favour of an offer made by German label Malicious Records. Malicious Records released the band's second album, Antichrist, in 1996, and also re-released the debut album Pentagram. The band went on a European tour with Satyricon and Dissection in April 1996, followed by a one-off gig in Bergen with Hades Almighty and Gehenna, at which the live EP The Last Tormentor was recorded. The band also played a one-off gig in the fall in Bischofswerda, Germany, with Behemoth. Soon the name Gorgoroth was commonplace in the black metal underground, both in Norway and in the rest of Europe, if somewhat overshadowed by some of the more famous black metal bands such as Mayhem or Emperor. The band's third full-length album, Under the Sign of Hell, was recorded in spring 1996, and guitarist Tormentor joined the band later in the year. Under the Sign of Hell was released in 1997, and Gorgoroth went on their first headlining European tour in fall 1997, with support by Mystic Circle. It was on this tour that Infernus and Tormentor were approached by the major German heavy metal record label Nuclear Blast, who wanted to sign the band. The band accepted the offer in late 1997.\n\n\n=== Tenure with Nuclear Blast (1997‚Äì2003) ===\nThe move to Nuclear Blast was controversial among many black metal enthusiasts who pertained to the tenets of an 'underground black metal scene'. The first album recorded and rel\nTeemu M√§ntysaari (Finnish pronunciation: [teÀêmu m√¶ntys…ëÀêri]; born 7 January 1987) is a Finnish guitarist. He is known for playing for metal bands Wintersun, Imperanon, Induction, Smackbound, and Megadeth. \n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 2004, he joined the band Wintersun and has toured with them since then. He also played for Imperanon until their break-up in 2007. He has written many unreleased songs with Imperanon.\nHe has also played for Smackbound since 2015.\nOn 5 September 2023, M√§ntysaari stepped in as lead guitarist on Megadeth's North American tour as regular guitarist Kiko Loureiro tended to undisclosed family matters. He was appointed on Loureiro's recommendation. \nOn 21 November 2023, Megadeth band leader Dave Mustaine released an official statement, announcing that the band is \"going to move forward with Teemu M√§ntysaari as the guitar player for Megadeth\" while Loureiro stays on an indefinite hiatus. This became permanent as Loureiro announced his departure from Megadeth later that month.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Related links ==\nWintersun's page on the Nuclear Blast website\nImperanon at Myspace",

This causes vaporization of the surrounding material, resulting in its rapid expansion. Kinetic energy created by this expansion contributes to the formation of a shock wave which expands spherically from the center. Intense thermal radiation at the hypocenter forms a nuclear fireball which, if the explosion is low enough in altitude, is often associated with a mushroom cloud.

Dirkschneider was fired in 1987, but the band (with David Reece and without Fischer again) returned in 1989 with Eat the Heat, which peaked at number 15 in Germany.

        "content": "Meshuggah () is a Swedish extreme metal band formed in Ume√• in 1987. Since 2004, the band's lineup consists of founding members Jens Kidman (lead vocals) and Fredrik Thordendal (lead guitar), alongside rhythm guitarist M√•rten Hagstr√∂m, drummer Tomas Haake and bassist Dick L√∂vgren. Since its formation, the band has released nine studio albums, six EPs and eight music videos. Their latest studio album, Immutable, was released in April 2022 via Atomic Fire Records.\nMeshuggah has become known for their innovative musical style and their complex, polymetered song structures and polyrhythms. They rose to fame as a significant act in extreme underground music, became an influence for modern metal bands, and gained a cult following. The band was labelled as one of the ten most important hard rock and heavy metal bands by Rolling Stone and as the most important band in metal by Alternative Press. In the late 2000s, the band was an inspiration for the djent subgenre.\nIn 2006 and 2009, Meshuggah was nominated for two Swedish Grammis Awards for their albums Catch Thirtythree and obZen, respectively. In 2018, the band was nominated for a Grammy Award for their song \"Clockworks\" under the \"Best Metal Performance\" category. The band has performed in various international festivals, including Ozzfest and Download, and embarked on the obZen world tour from 2008 to 2010, and also the \"Ophidian Trek\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and Contradictions Collapse (1987‚Äì1994) ===\n\nIn 1985, guitarist Fredrik Thordendal formed a band in Ume√•, a university town in northern Sweden with a population of 105,000. The band, originally named Metallien, recorded a number of demo tapes, after which it disbanded. Thordendal, however, continued playing under a different name with new band members.\nMeshuggah was formed in 1987 by lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Jens Kidman, and took the name Meshuggah from the Yiddish word for \"crazy\" (ultimately derived from the Hebrew word ◊û÷∞◊©◊Å◊ï÷º◊í÷∏◊¢‚Äé). Kidman found the word in an American street slang dictionary. The band recorded several demos before Kidman left, which prompted the remaining members to disband. Kidman then formed a new band, Calipash, with guitarist Thordendal, bassist Peter Nordin and drummer Niklas Lundgren. Kidman, who also played guitar, and Thordendal decided to restore the name Meshuggah for the new band.\nIn 1989, Meshuggah released the self-titled, three-song EP Meshuggah, which is commonly known as Psykisk Testbild (a title that could be translated as \"Psychological Test-Picture\"). This 12\" (30 cm) vinyl EP had only 1,000 copies released, sold by local record store Garageland. The EP's back cover features the band members with cheese doodles on their faces.\nAfter replacing drummer Niklas Lundgren with Tomas Haake in 1990, Meshuggah signed a contract with German heavy metal record label Nuclear Blast and recorded its debut full-length album, Contradictions Collapse. The LP, originally entitled (All this because of) Greed, was released in 1991. The album received positive reviews, but was not a commercial success. Soon after, Kidman decided to concentrate on vocals, and guitarist M√•rten Hagstr√∂m, who had already played in a band with Haake when they were in sixth grade, was recruited. The new lineup recorded the EP None at Tonteknik Recordings in Ume√• in 1994 for release later that year. A Japanese version was also released, including lyrics printed in Japanese.\nDuring this period, Thordendal, who was working as a carpenter, severed the tip of his left middle finger, while Haake injured his hand in a router accident. As a result, the band was unable to perform for several months. Thordendal's fingertip was later reattached, and he went on to make a full recovery. The Selfcaged EP was recorded in April and May 1994, but its release was delayed to later in 1995 due to the accidents.\n\n\n=== Destroy Erase Improve (1995‚Äì1997) ===\n\nIn January 1995, Meshuggah undertook a short European tour organized by its r\nMeshuggah is a Swedish extreme metal band formed in 1987 in Ume√•. Meshuggah is known for its use of extended polymetric passages, complex time signatures, dissonant guitar riffs, and harsh vocals. As of 2008, the band consists of vocalist Jens Kidman, guitarists Fredrik Thordendal and M√•rten Hagstr√∂m, bassist Dick L√∂vgren and drummer Tomas Haake.\nMeshuggah's first release was a self-titled three-song 12\" vinyl EP, Meshuggah, which is commonly known as Psykisk Testbild, although that title is not printed anywhere. Only 1000 copies were released by local record store Garageland in Ume√•. After signing to German heavy metal record label Nuclear Blast, Meshuggah released its debut album Contradictions Collapse in 1991. Meshuggah's second album, Destroy Erase Improve, was released in 1995.\nThordendal's side project's album, Sol Niger Within, was released in 1997, as was the next Meshuggah EP, The True Human Design. These were followed by the next full-length album, Chaosphere, in 1998.\nA collection of demos (from Meshuggah) and rare recordings were released as the Rare Trax album in 2001. In 2002 the band released their next album, Nothing. Meshuggah was not satisfied with the production of the album and later re-recorded the guitars for the re-release in 2006, which also includes a bonus DVD that features the band's appearance at the Download 2005 festival, along with the official music videos for \"Rational Gaze\", \"Shed\" and \"New Millennium Cyanide Christ\". Meshuggah released I in 2004, a single 21-minute track, and in 2005 the band released the next full-length album, Catch Thirtythree, a 47-minute song divided up into 13 movements, the only album with programmed drums. In 2008, Meshuggah released obZen, followed by Koloss in 2012 and The Violent Sleep of Reason in 2016. Their newest album, Immutable, was released in 2022.\n\n\n== Studio albums ==\n\n\n== Live albums ==\n\n\n== Compilation albums ==\n\n\n== EPs ==\n\n\n== Music videos ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMeshuggah's official website\nNothing is the fourth studio album by Swedish extreme metal band Meshuggah, originally released in 2002. The album entered the Billboard 200 chart at number 165, slightly higher than the band's following effort, Catch Thirtythree.\nA last-minute decision to join 2002's Ozzfest tour forced the band to mix the album in two days and to master it in one. As a result, the album had its guitars and drums re-recorded for a remastered re-release in 2006.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\n\nThe songs on this album consist of slower tempos and a heavy focus on groove instead of the thrash metal style of previous albums. Jazz fusion elements such as the interludes found in some songs on the band's Destroy Erase Improve album are still present in this release.\nThis is also the first album on which guitarists Fredrik Thordendal and M√•rten Hagstr√∂m experimented with 8-string guitars by re-recording the guitar tracks, replacing the original performances made using detuned 7-string guitars, due in part to their custom Nevborn guitars not being ready.\n\n\n== Release and reception ==\n\nThe track \"Rational Gaze\" was promoted with three music videos. The first was a repetitive black-and-white sequence of pictures, and did not have much connection with the song structure; the second version, directed by Torbj√∂rn Oyesvold, featured a blue-greenish environment with the band performing, heavy post-processed by blurry video filters; the third version, entitled \"Mr. Kidman Delirium Version\", was not an official video, but rather a handicam of Jens Kidman performing as his bandmates, with the help of different wigs. In January 2018, Loudwire named Nothing their favorite djent album.\nNothing has sold over 95,000 copies in the US.\n\n\n=== Re-release ===\nA re-recorded and remastered version of the album was released on 31 October 2006. The new version features new rhythm guitar tracks re-recorded with 8-string guitars. The drums were also re-recorded by using the original drum hits as triggers for new audio produced with virtual drum software. The vocals were not re-recorded, but were given effects processing.\nThere are two songs significantly modified from their original version. These include the tempo of \"Nebulous\" which was lowered, and the track length of \"Obsidian\" was nearly doubled with the ending fadeout removed.\nThe re-release also includes a DVD containing music videos and their Download Festival performance in 2005, as well as modified cover art.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nOriginal 2002 Release:\n\n2006 Remastered Edition:\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nJens Kidman ‚àí vocals\nFredrik Thordendal ‚àí lead guitar, bass, rhythm guitar on the 2006 re-release\nM√•rten Hagstr√∂m ‚àí rhythm guitar, bass\nTomas Haake ‚àí drums, spoken vocals (4, 8, 9), artwork\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\nKoloss is the seventh studio album by Swedish extreme metal band Meshuggah, released on 23 March 2012 in Germany, on 26 March in the rest of Europe, and on March 27 in North America, by Nuclear Blast.\n\n\n== Background ==\nTomas Haake stated, \"As always, we try to take our music in a slightly different direction with each album and with Koloss, we feel that we really nailed what we were going for. Organic brutality, viscera and groove all crammed into a 54-minute metalicious treat, best avoided by the faint of heart!!\"\nThe Koloss album was different from others in terms of cooperation and making music together. Fredrik and M√•rten worked together in creating a couple of songs together. Jens Kidman who retired from guitar playing since the album Contradictions Collapse composed \"Behind the Sun\".\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe album was released on 23 March 2012 in Germany, 26 March in the rest of Europe and on March 27 in North America. It was released as a standard compact disc, as a digipak version featuring a bonus DVD, as a limited edition boxed set \"magic cube\" (a mock-Rubik's Cube featuring the album artwork, available only through Nuclear Blast mail-order), and a double-LP pressed on brown vinyl.\nThe album debuted at number 17 in the United States, with first week sales of 18,342 copies, the band's and record label's highest position on the charts. Koloss also debuted at number 27 on the Canadian Albums Chart.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nKoloss received generally favorable reviews. Kory Grow of Spin Magazine called it \"the first real contender for the genre's album of the year\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n=== I Am Colossus EP ===\n\"I Am Colossus\" was released as a two-track EP.

Most of us are in our 50s now, and we‚Äôve settled into who we are. Even though we‚Äôve been experimenting all along, I also think we‚Äôve been the same since day one.‚Äù\nHe continued: ‚ÄúThe way we approach things and why we still make new albums, and why we still sound the way we do, it‚Äôs immutable. Humanity is immutable, too. We commit the same mistakes over and over. And we are immutable. We do what we do, and we don‚Äôt change.‚Äù\nIn addition, certain Meshuggah songs on Spotify leaked a URL, which was https://immutable.se/. Clicking the link would give you a teaser of the song \"Ligature Marks\" and the release date.\nThe songs \"The Abysmal Eye\", \"Light the Shortening Fuse\" and \"I Am That Thirst\" were published as singles before the album release. Music videos were released for \"The Abysmal Eye\" and \"Broken Cog\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nImmutable has received universal acclaim from critics with a score 83 out of 100 on Metacritic. Thom Jurek of AllMusic wrote: \"Ultimately, Immutable delivers the very essence of Meshuggah. While comfortable in their collective skin, they continue expanding their reach by obliterating ‚Äì hell, nearly swallowing ‚Äì metal's genre boundaries in their long, relentless search for the undiscovered.\"\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Meshuggah ===\nJens Kidman ‚Äì vocals\nFredrik Thordendal ‚Äì lead guitar on 2, 6, 8, 11\nM√•rten Hagstr√∂m ‚Äì rhythm and lead guitars, backing vocals on 11, whispers on 1.\nDick L√∂vgren ‚Äì bass\nTomas Haake ‚Äì drums, spoken word on 11\n\n\n=== Production ===\nRickard Bengtsson and Staffan Karlsson ‚Äì mixing\nVlado Meller ‚Äì mastering\nLuminokaya ‚Äì artwork\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\nMeshuggah, also known as Psykisk Testbild (Pronounced \"see-kisk test-build\") is the debut EP by Swedish extreme metal band Meshuggah.

It was released as a 12\" vinyl record, limited to 1000 copies, by local record store Garageland in Ume√•. This is the only Meshuggah record featuring drummer Niclas Lundgren. Tomas Haake later replaced Lundgren on drums. The track \"Cadaverous Mastication\" was included on their first studio album, Contradictions Collapse.

Me and Fredrik would just jam on something, and when we found something that was kind of cool, he would walk into the control room. I would just record drums and it wasn't a set pattern, I would just kind of stray away from the pattern, but just keep going in that vibe. Then we had to chart everything and go bar by bar to record the guitars afterwards, because it's all just random.\" Thordendal would later post the chart of the first part of the song on his Instagram account.\nHaake later commented that the song was \"originally recorded for Jason Popson's Fractured Transmitter record label\" and that it was a \"'one-off' that Nuclear Blast gave us the go-ahead for ‚Äî as we were under contract with them.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nThe original vinyl release has track 1 on side A, and tracks 2-4 on side B while the 2016 re-issue only has track 1\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nTomas Haake ‚Äì drums\nM√•rten Hagstr√∂m ‚Äì rhythm guitar\nJens Kidman ‚Äì vocals\nFredrik Thordendal ‚Äì lead guitar, bass\n\n\n== References ==\nNone is the second EP by Swedish extreme metal band Meshuggah.

While sources such as The Guardian and Guitar World describe djent as a genre, some notable musicians including Randy Blythe (Lamb of God) and Stephen Carpenter (Deftones) say it is not.\n\n\n== Development ==\nFredrik Thordendal, lead guitarist of Swedish band Meshuggah, is considered the originator of the djent technique. However, the band did not coin the term itself. In a 2018 interview by Rauta, Meshuggah guitarist M√•rten Hagstr√∂m apologized for the band's role in creating the \"djent\" style of guitar playing, calling it \"a drunk misunderstanding\".\nOther bands important in the development of the style are Animals as Leaders, Periphery, Tesseract, and Textures.\nThe scene has grown rapidly, and members of the original online community, including the bands Chimp Spanner, Sithu Aye, and Monuments, have gone on to tour and release albums commercially. Other bands influenced by djent include A Life once lost, Veil of Maya, Vildhjarta, and Xerath. Born of Osiris have also been described as being inspired by the djent movement. Furthermore, Hacktivist and DVSR are djent bands that use rapping as a primary vocal style.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nDjent as a style is characterized by progressive, rhythmic, and technical complexity accompanied by a use of polymetric groove. An example is the song \"Cafo\" by Animals as Leaders. It typically features heavily-distorted, palm-muted guitar chords, syncopated riffs, and poly-meters alongside virtuosic soloing. Another common feature is the use of extended range guitars that are seven-string, eight-string, and nine-string, or even more strings.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nSome members of the metal community have criticized the term \"djent\", either treating it as a short-lived fad, openly condemning it, or questioning its validity as a genre. However, bands such as Tesseract and Animals as Leaders have received positive critical reception and multiple awards. Post-metal band Rosetta is noted as saying, \"Maybe we should start calling doom metal 'DUNNN'\". In response to a question about \"djent\", Lamb of God vocalist Randy Blythe stated in 2011, \"There is no such thing as 'djent'; it's not a genre\". Deftones guitarist Stephen Carpenter similarly opined in 2016 that \"I thoroughly can get djent, I even have great appreciation for the bands, and I mean Meshuggah is one of my favorite bands. But it's just not a genre. It's just metal\". In an interview with Guitar Messenger, Periphery guitarist Misha Mansoor said:\n\nI was looking for gear that was djenty. I was like: 'Are these pickups djenty?' For some reason it caught on, but completely in the wrong way, because people think it's a style of music and they think it's a style of music I play.\nIn a later interview with Freethinkers Blog, Mansoor stated that he felt djent had become \"this big umbrella term for any sort of progressive band, and also any band that will [use] off-time chugs [...] You also get bands like Scale the Summit [who are referred to as] a djent band [when] 80% of their stuff sounds like clean channel, and it's all beautiful and pretty, you know [...] In that way, I think it's cool because it groups really cool bands together [...] We are surrounded by a lot of bands that I respect, but at the same time, I don't think people know what djent is either [...] It's very unclear\". Later in the interview, he stated, \"If you call us djent, that's fine. I mean, I would never self-apply the term, but at the same time, it's just so vague that I don't know what to make of it\". In 2023, Periphery directly referenced the term's controversy with the subtitle of their seventh studio album, Periphery V: Djent is not a Genre.\nTosin Abasi of Animals as Leaders takes a more lenient view of the term, stating that there are specific characteristics that are common to djent bands, and as a result the term can be legitimately used as a genre. While stating tha\nobZen is the sixth studio album by Swedish extreme metal band Meshuggah. It was released in Europe on 7 March 2008, and in North America on 11 March 2008 by Nuclear Blast. Tomas Haake made his return as a studio drummer for the record after the Drumkit from Hell drum software was used on Catch Thirtythree. It is also the first album on which bassist Dick Lovgren performs despite having been a member of the band since 2004; this is due to the bass having been digitally programmed on the previous album, Catch Thirtythree, and the bass having been performed by guitarist Fredrik Thordendal on the previous I EP. The release of the album was followed by their first world tour. A music video was filmed for a shorter version of the song \"Bleed\". A two-disc vinyl re-issue was released on 22 March 2019 through Nuclear Blast. A remastered version was released 31 March 2023 for the 15th anniversary through Atomic Fire.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn an interview with Revolver, drummer Tomas Haake stated that obZen would be a collective return to the band's past works, signalling a shift in direction away from their previous effort, Catch Thirtythree. \"We've got some fast, intense songs and hectic, heavy stuff that draws from all the things we've done in the past.\"\nThe album was originally planned for release in November 2007, prior to a European tour featuring Meshuggah and The Dillinger Escape Plan. The recording process for obZen took longer than expected and led the band to drop out of the tour, later explaining on their official website that the \"album-promotional\" aspect of the touring no longer applied and that they would rather focus their priorities on getting the record finished.\nIn an interview, Haake commented further on the time taken to record the album, saying, \"This time around we took almost six months to do all the recording and the sampling [...] we definitely took our time\". Drumkit from Hell was used on the album, but not programmed as Catch Thirtythree was. Drumkit from Hell was an auxiliary sound source. He elaborated on the concept of the album in another interview, saying: \"If you haven't figured it out yet, obZen means that mankind has found its 'zen' in the obscure and obscene.\" Haake also mentioned his favorite track on this album is \"Dancers to a Discordant System\". Meshuggah performed the song live for the first time at the opening show of the Koloss tour in Bristol, England, on 12 April 2012. It was performed as the closing song for every show on the tour since then.\nThe song \"Bleed\" was released as DLC for the Rock Band video games via the Rock Band Network on 18 June 2010.\n\n\n== Album art ==\nAlthough Meshuggah had not done so in the past, the album art of obZen was outsourced. With a vision of what they wanted the artwork to be, Meshuggah made use of cross-media artist Joachim Luetke. In an interview with Nuclear Blast USA, Haake and Hagstr√∂m explain that the artwork features a photograph of a male model in the \"zen lotus position\" with the bottom half of the photograph being from a female model. This is because the male model could not perform the position, making the figure androgynous. The model is covered in blood, which is explained as a metaphor for mankind finding peace of mind through obscenity. Additionally, each of the three blood-smeared hands poses in the shape of the number six, which is meant to symbolize the inherently evil nature of man.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nobZen was acclaimed by critics and fans alike. On Metacritic, it has a score of 83 out of 100 based on 6 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nThe album was praised for its consistency, and the band for their continued musical evolution, with Nick Terry from Decibel saying, \"Three years on, and we have a new reference point to chart Meshuggah's musical evolution. And yeah, things are evolving nicely\".\nThe album was also praised for the band revisiting their early thrash metal-oriented approach on tracks like \"Combustion\" and \"Bleed\", while still \nFredrik Carl Thordendal (born 11 February 1970) is a Swedish musician best known as the lead guitarist and backing vocalist for the extreme metal band Meshuggah, of which he is a founding member. Along with Meshuggah's rhythm guitarist M√•rten Hagstr√∂m, Thordendal was rated No. 35 by Guitar World in their list of the top 100 greatest heavy metal guitarists of all time.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Meshuggah ===\n\nThordendal began his career when he formed 'Metallien,' a heavily Metallica-influenced band, in his hometown of Ume√• in 1985. The band later changed their name to Meshuggah and released their first LP, Psykisk Testbild, in 1989. Starting as a thrash metal band, Meshuggah's music gradually evolved into a more progressive sound. This sound has become influential to other bands, such as Periphery, whose core member, Misha Mansoor, was instrumental in coining the term \"Djent\" to refer to the commonly utilized technique of playing heavily muted, extended power chords found in Meshuggah's music. Thordendal has been widely recognized in the metal community for his work with Meshuggah.\nSometime in the 90s, before the release of Destroy Erase Improve, Thordendal was involved in a carpentry accident at work in which he cut off the tip of his left middle finger. The fingertip was sewn back on, and after a significant amount of re-learning and practicing, he regained full proficiency on the guitar within a year or so.\n\n\n=== Fredrik Thordendal's Special Defects: Sol Niger Within ===\nUnder the name Fredrik Thordendal's Special Defects, Thordendal released a solo album in 1997 titled Sol Niger Within with Ultimate Audio Entertainment. The album was remixed and re-released by Ultimate Audio Entertainment and Relapse Records in 1999 under the title Sol Niger Within Version 3.33. The re-release contains two bonus tracks but omits several parts of the original version. The newly mastered version of SNW was also released for the first time on vinyl in 2016 by Husaria Records, an American label specializing in audiophile releases. The album's original material was pressed in both a lacquer cut variant (500 units) and a Direct Metal Mastering variant (500 units). Thordendal also contributed to several tracks for drummer Morgan √Ögren's Mats/Morgan Band.\nRegarding a second Special Defects album, Thordendal states, \"It's actually been messing with my head for years now. I haven't really found the time to get the project going. This is a project that I will work on for a longer time, with no rush whatsoever, to make it the best I possibly can. I'm looking forward to making it because I think it will sound so different from anything I've ever heard before.\"\n\n\n=== Other projects and contributions ===\n\nThordendal has been involved in numerous side projects, such as XXX Atomic Toejam with Petter Marklund. The project initially released a 7\" two-track single titled 'Celebration' under the name Sep√ºlchre Inc. They later adopted the name XXX Atomic Toejam and issued an MCD entitled A Gathering of the Tribes for the First / Last Human Be-In on Cold Meat Industry, as well as featuring a track on the Karmanik Collection compilation. A full-length album was long announced but never materialized. Thordendal also played bass for Petter Marklund's solo project, Memorandum, and, together with Marklund, remixed tracks on the 1995 compilation album Ars Moriendi.\nIn 2010, Thordendal recorded some drum tracks with Morgan √Ögren of the Swedish prog-rock band Kaipa and Dirk Verbeuren of Soilwork.\nSeveral of Thordendal's demos have been released on the internet as MP3s or as videos on YouTube. Demo 33 was used to demonstrate a MIDI breath controller created by Johan Haake, which is used on several Meshuggah songs, including Future Breed Machine.\nThordendal is also a notable producer, having produced all of Meshuggah's recent material as well as releases for various other bands, including Switzerland's Fragment.\nThordendal is featured in the Darkane track 'Psychic Pain' from t\nThe Violent Sleep of Reason is the eighth studio album by Swedish extreme metal band Meshuggah. It was released on 7 October 2016 via Nuclear Blast. This album was recorded live in the studio, simultaneously with all members, rather than recording each instrument separately as is more common for modern recording. The band announced the new album, its title, and track list via Blabbermouth.net and Revolver magazine on 5 August 2016.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe album's title was loosely inspired by The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters, an etching by Spanish painter Francisco Goya. The album's title and lyrical themes are a commentary on terrorism, extremist views on ideals, religious dogma, and the violent implications of \"being asleep, so to speak, or not reacting to what's going on in the proper way\". Concerning the album artwork, Tomas Haake stated:\n\n\"It was a hard one in the sense that you don't immediately have a visual to the title The Violent Sleep of Reason ‚Äì how do you portray that?\n\"So when discussing this with Keerych Luminokaya, who also did the artwork for our 25th anniversary box set along with the artwork for Koloss, we just let him loose on that idea and how to portray that.\n\"What you're seeing on the artwork is basically a human being that's been in stasis for a long time. The vines were the original idea ‚Äì they're growing into him. But it's a body that's been asleep for so long that it's been taken over by something else.\"\n\nIn an attempt to depart from the production on previous albums like Koloss and obZen, this album was recorded live. According to Haake, this allowed the band to capture their sound more \"honestly\" and to capture the \"rawness\" of albums from the late '80s and early '90s that \"inspired us when we were growing up.\" Haake elaborated:\n\n\"If you put it all together using computers then you often have to fix problems after the fact. I've gone back to records where I've not known every drum part. And once you do that you can start with drums and then just add layers of guitars and then bass and it all sounds perfect.\n\"ObZen and Koloss are great albums but, to me, they are a little too perfect. It didn't really capture what we sounded like honestly.\n\n\"But where we recorded live you get to hear the push and pull, one person might be a little ahead and the other might be a little behind. If you kill that, you can kill the energy.\"Bassist Dick L√∂vgren for the first time contributed significantly to the writing of most songs for the album. Lead guitarist Fredrik Thordendal wrote the least on this album than ever in his career due to rumored side project which is a second album continued from Sol Niger Within. This caused him to rollout from live performances. M√•rten Hagstr√∂m used a 28\" scale guitar instead of 29.4\" due to arthritis problems to shoulder.\n\n\n== Release ==\nIn advance of the album, three songs were released on the YouTube channel of the band's record label, Nuclear Blast. \"Born in Dissonance\", also released as a single, was uploaded on 25 August 2016; a lyric video for \"Nostrum\" was released on 15 September 2016, while the official video for \"Clockworks\" was released on 7 October 2016. On 20 September 2016 the band released a live play-through drum cam video of \"Nostrum\" highlighting Tomas Haake's drum playing. There was also a live drum play-through camera released for Clockworks released on 12 October 2016, which has over 1.5 million views worldwide.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nThe Violent Sleep of Reason has received universal acclaim from critics and fans alike. A review by Max Frank on the popular site Metalsucks.net gave the album five out of five stars and described it as a \"tour-de-force; a total deconstruction of heavy music.\" The review focuses on a paradox between what it describes as complex composition structures that seem to critique the norms of the metal genre, and some of the band members' professed ignorance of music theory. Frank states, \"Theoreticians out there might say that Violent Sl\nChaosphere is the third studio album by Swedish extreme metal band Meshuggah. It was released on 9 November 1998 by Nuclear Blast, and is the only studio album to feature bassist Gustaf Hielm. Chaosphere's sound shows the band toning down some of the thrash style of their previous releases in favor of the technical, polyrhythmic, groove-oriented sound they would continue to explore on subsequent albums. A video was made for \"New Millennium Cyanide Christ\".\nThe Japanese version of the album contains a bonus song, titled \"Unanything\", as track 9. This song was also included on the promotional card-sleeve CD as track 6.\nOn both this and the standard album release, after \"Elastic\" there is a period of silence then an unlisted and unindexed track where four of the album's songs are played at once, with volume changes making each song somewhat dominant and recognisable in the mix at different times.\nThe \"Reloaded\" re-release features five of the six tracks from The True Human Design EP.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Meshuggah ===\nJens Kidman ‚Äì vocals\nFredrik Thordendal ‚Äì lead guitar, keyboards\nM√•rten Hagstr√∂m ‚Äì rhythm guitar\nGustaf Hielm ‚Äì bass\nTomas Haake ‚Äì drums, vocals (on \"Sane\", \"The Exquisite Machinery of Torture\", and \"Futile Bread Machine (Campfire Version)\")\n\n\n=== Production ===\nDaniel Bergstrand ‚Äì recording, mixdown\nFredrik Thordendal ‚Äì recording, mixdown\nPeter in de Betou ‚Äì mastering (at Cutting Room, Stockholm, Sweden)\nTomas Haake ‚Äì artwork, design\nMeshuggah ‚Äì art direction\nJohn Norhager ‚Äì band photo\n\n\n== References ==\nDestroy Erase Improve is the second studio album by Swedish extreme metal band Meshuggah. It was released on 12 May 1995 by Nuclear Blast. This is the first studio album to feature rhythm guitarist M√•rten Hagstr√∂m and the final to feature bassist Peter Nordin, as he left the band during the supporting tour due to vertigo.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nDescribing the record as \"one of the 90's definitive metallic works\", Kevin Stewart-Panko argues that Destroy Erase Improve's unique fusion of genres amounted to a new \"watermark\" for heavy metal upon its release. Metal critic Martin Popoff regards Destroy Erase Improve as the first clear demonstration of what would become the quintessential Meshuggah sound, wherein \"stutter gun\" riffs and \"upset apple cart time signatures\" are featured alongside \"bone-breaking\" percussion, an approach which resulted in considerable influence in the development of genres like mathcore and djent. Popoff suggests that Destroy Erase Improve is the clear linchpin of Meshuggah's particular style, a \"specific, nearly absurd proposal that only this band has dared to own.\"\nThe album was ranked number 42 on Rolling Stone's 50 Greatest Prog Rock Albums of All Time list. In 2017, Rolling Stone ranked Destroy Erase Improve as 77th on their list of 'The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time.'

It was founded in 1987 by Markus Staiger in Donzdorf. Originally releasing hardcore punk records, the label moved on to releasing albums by thrash metal, melodic death metal, grindcore, industrial metal, power metal and black metal bands, as well as tribute albums. It also distributes and promotes post-hardcore/metalcore labels SharpTone Records; another post-hardcore/metalcore label, Arising Empire, was in Nuclear Blast portfolio until its acquirement by Kontor New Media in 2020.\nIn October 2018, French independent label Believe Digital acquired a majority stake in Nuclear Blast.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nNuclear Blast was formed in 1987 after founder Markus Staiger traveled throughout the United States for four weeks and saw a gig of his favorite band BL'AST!. The label's first release was a vinyl compilation called Senseless Death (NB 001) featuring US hardcore bands like Attitude, Sacred Denial, Impulse Manslaughter and others.\nSwedish band Meshuggah became the first band in the history of Nuclear Blast Records to crack the Billboard 200, landing at number 165 with their 2002 album, Nothing. Meshuggah also became the first Nuclear Blast band to be reviewed in Rolling Stone magazine.\nIn 2004, Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish released Once on Nuclear Blast, which rocketed to the top of the charts in multiple countries, including Finland, Germany, Norway, Greece, Sweden, Austria, and more. It became the first release in the company's history to reach number 1 on the German charts. Slayer released the album Repentless in 2015 which went to number 4 on the Billboard 200 making it the highest charting Nuclear Blast release in the United States.\nDuring the 2000s and 2010s, Nuclear Blast signed many veteran thrash metal bands including Slayer, Exodus, Testament, Anthrax, Kreator, Overkill, Sepultura, Destruction, Tankard, Death Angel, and Heathen.\nIn 2021, Nuclear Blast founder Markus Staiger launched a new record company called Atomic Fire GmbH.\nIn June 2022, Nuclear Blast unveiled a new logo. The logo caused some controversy when the canned water company Liquid Death jokingly noted its similarities with their logo (which also features a melting skull), inadvertedly leading to its designer, Justin Moll, receiving hate mail. Liquid Death quickly apologized for the joke, saying that it was not targeted at Moll but at Nuclear Blast, whose personnel had reportedly raised concerns over the new logo's similarities with Liquid Death's before it was implemented.\nOn 23 August 2022, the video game Saints Row was released, which features an in-game radio station that includes Nuclear Blast artists.\n\n\n== Blood Blast Distribution ==\nBlood Blast Distribution is a subsidiary of Nuclear Blast that focuses solely on the distribution of extreme music.

Originating as a line of greeting cards, Goggin expanded the concept into a cabaret show that ran for 38 weeks, and eventually into a full-length musical. The original Off-Broadway production opened December 12, 1985, running for 3,672 performances and becoming the second-longest-running Off-Broadway show in history. The show has since been adapted for television, starring Rue McClanahan, and has spawned six sequels and three spin-offs.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Nunsense concept originated as a line of greeting cards featuring a nun offering tart quips with a clerical slant. The cards caught on so quickly that Goggin decided to expand the concept into a cabaret show called The Nunsense Story, which opened for a four-day run at Manhattan's Duplex and remained for 38 weeks, encouraging its creator to expand it into a full-length theater production.\nThe original production of Nunsense, directed by Goggin, opened on December 12, 1985 at the Off-Broadway Cherry Lane Theatre, moving to the Douglas Fairbanks Theater for the majority of its ten-year run. It ran for 3,672 performances, becoming the second-longest running Off-Broadway show in history (after The Fantasticks). By the time it closed, it had become an international phenomenon translated into at least 26 languages with more than 8,000 productions worldwide. It has grossed over $500 million worldwide, and more than 25,000 women have played in Nunsense productions worldwide, including Edie Adams, Maxine Audley, Kaye Ballard, Honor Blackman, Pat Carroll, Peggy Cass, Phyllis Diller, Sally Struthers, Louise Gold, Maggie Fitzhugh and JoAnne Worley. The five-woman production won four Outer Critics Circle Awards, including best Off-Broadway musical, best book and best music. A 1985 London cast recording was made, as well as a 1986 recording with the off-Broadway cast. The show opened on London's West End at the Fortune Theatre in March 1987.\nGoggin adapted both Nunsense and Nunsense 2 for television productions with Rue McClanahan as the mother superior. Also starring in this version were Terri White as Sister Mary Hubert, Semina DeLaurentis as Sister Mary Amnesia, Christine Anderson as Sister Robert Anne and Christine Toy as Sister Mary Leo. The show and its sequels are popular choices of community theater and summer stock theatre troupes. In 2004, the \"20th Anniversary All-Star Tour\" of the show starred Kaye Ballard as Sister Mary Regina, Georgia Engel as Sister Mary Leo, Mimi Hines as Sister Mary Amnesia, Darlene Love as Sister Mary Hubert, and Lee Meriwether as Sister Robert Anne.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nFive of the 19 surviving Little Sisters of Hoboken, a one-time missionary order that ran a leper colony on an island south of France, discover that their cook, Sister Julia, Child of God, accidentally killed the other fifty-two residents of the convent with her tainted vichyssoise while they were off playing bingo with a group of Maryknolls. Upon discovering the disaster, Mother Superior had a vision in which she was told to start a greeting card company to raise funds for the burials. The greeting cards were an enormous success and, thinking there was plenty of money, the Reverend Mother bought a VCR and camcorder for the convent, leaving her with no money in the kitty to pay for the last four burials. With the deceased nuns on ice in the deep freeze, they decide to stage a variety show in the Mount Saint Helen's School auditorium to raise the necessary amount. Participating in the project are Mother Superior Mary Regina, a former circus performer who can not resist the spotlight; her competitive but dignified rival, second-in-command Sister Mary Hubert; Sister Robert Anne, a streetwise nun from Brooklyn; Sister Mary Leo, a novice who is determined to be the world's first ballerina nun; and wacky, childlike Sister Mary Amnesia, who lost her memory when a crucifix fell on her head.  The entertainment that they \nM√•rten Hans Hagstr√∂m (born 27 April 1971) is a Swedish musician, best known as the rhythm guitarist for the extreme metal band Meshuggah. He joined the band after the release of their first album, which allowed Jens Kidman to focus on his vocal performances and give up rhythm guitar duties. He and fellow Meshuggah guitarist Fredrik Thordendal are known for their complex rhythm guitar playing. Hagstr√∂m has cited Rush, James Hetfield, Squarepusher, Autechre, Strapping Young Lad, and GISM as influences.\nIn a Metal Injection interview he has said, \"You can't play an instrument for the technicality of it. It's a tool you use to get what's in here and here [heart and mind] out there.\" He has also stated that when he first started learning guitar, the prevailing trend was for increasingly virtuosic lead playing, and that he decided to focus on developing his intricate rhythm guitar style instead.\nAlthough Thordendal plays most of Meshuggah's guitar solos, the two of them share songwriting duties more or less equally, with Hagstr√∂m notably contributing \"Nebulous\" from Nothing, \"Acrid Placidity\" from Destroy Erase Improve, and \"Neurotica\" from Chaosphere. Hagstr√∂m has also stepped out of his role of playing exclusively rhythm guitar with the release of Meshuggah's obZen album by playing the slower, melodic leads on the songs that he wrote, such as \"Electric Red\" and \"Pravus\".\nIn addition to this, he has contributed lyrics to some of the band's later releases, co-writing Catch 33 with Meshuggah drummer Tomas Haake and penning the entirety of the words for their abstract EP I. Hagstr√∂m and Haake have been playing music together since they were nine years old.\nHagstr√∂m, along with Thordendal, was rated #35 by Guitar World in their top 100 of the greatest heavy metal guitarists of all time.\n\n\n== Equipment ==\n\n\n=== Guitars ===\n\nHagstr√∂m's main guitar is an Ibanez Custom 8-String M8M which feature RG-shaped alder or Iceman-shaped swamp ash bodies with 5-piece maple/Bubinga neck-thru necks (29.4\" {746.76 mm}), rosewood fingerboards (no inlays), fixed bridge (actually an Ibanez FX-Edge fixed tremolo), one volume, one tone, and one Lundgren Model 8 pickup. He uses .9-.70 gauge strings, tuned down half a step. Up until the late '90s, both Hagstr√∂m and Thordendal used Ibanez 7-string guitars (initially Universe models, then single-pickup variations of the RG7620 and RG7621 for Thordendal and Hagstr√∂m respectively) before moving to Nevborn 8-string guitars during the Nothing era. The group found the Nevborns to be somewhat unstable while touring and when Ibanez communicated a desire to try building them 8-string guitars they accepted the offer.\nMarten Hagstrom got his custom 8 string to be modded to accommodate some arthritis issues to his shoulder. His new custom Ibanez M8M is 28\" scale length with semi-hollow body facilitated easy stage performance and studio recording. He also got a production model 27\" scale guitar (Ibanez Iron Label ARZIR28 8 String) for the other half of the stage time.\nGuitar Strings:DR Strings, Tite-Fit, LH-9 \"Lite & Heavy\" set: [.009 ‚Äì .011 ‚Äì .016 ‚Äì .026 ‚Äì .036 ‚Äì .046], .052, .070 (stock gauges on the Ibanez M8M signature guitar)\nDR Strings, Tite-Fit, TF8-10 \"8 String Medium\" set: .010 ‚Äì .013 ‚Äì .017 ‚Äì .026 ‚Äì .036 ‚Äì .046 ‚Äì .056 ‚Äì .075\nGuitar Picks:Jim Dunlop 1mm Nylon Standard\n\n\n=== Amplifiers and effects ===\nFortin Amplifiers \"Meshuggah\" custom amplifier heads\nFractal Audio Axe-Fx Ultra (as of the obZen tour)\nLine 6 Vetta II Head Units\nT.C.

He is the bass guitarist for extreme metal band Meshuggah, which he joined in 2004.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nIn his early days, L√∂vgren was particularly impressed with the Metallica bass guitarist Cliff Burton. He said that Burton \"was probably the main reason why I became a bassist\". L√∂vgren is a schooled jazz musician, influenced by Dave Holland, John Scofield, Medeski Martin & Wood, Miles Davis and Brad Mehldau. He always preferred playing with fingers; however, in his main band, Meshuggah, he plays with a pick exclusively, stating that the exact sound from the pick and distortion is strictly what Meshuggah wants to extract from the bass guitar.\nBefore joining Meshuggah, L√∂vgren performed with a vast array of bands in his native Sweden, first with the neo-classical metal/melodic power metal band Time Requiem, then the melodic/progressive metal band Last Tribe, the death metal band Cromlech and the power metal band Armageddon (alongside Arch Enemy guitarist Christopher Amott). In the late 1990s, L√∂vgren held the enviable assignment of touring bass guitarist for both Arch Enemy and In Flames.\nL√∂vgren joined Meshuggah in 2004 after the band lost their bass guitarist, Gustaf Hielm, in 2001. In the same year, they released their EP I, that contains just one track of the same name, that lasts twenty-one minutes. However, L√∂vgren did not play in Meshuggah's recording sessions until their highly successful album, obZen (2008). This was due to the album finish deadline while recording Catch Thirtythree, so the drum and bass tracks were recorded digitally. He also released a highly acclaimed fusion-jazz album, Lounge, with the Swedish Nica Group ensemble. All tracks were composed by L√∂vgren, and the album shows his creativity as well as jazz-styled playing skills.\nIn September 2010, L√∂vgren was accepted into the Gothenburg Music University to study improvisation and composition with Anders Jormin, the Swedish jazz double bass player, arranger and bandleader who has worked with numerous jazz artists, such as Bobo Stenson, Charles Lloyd, Tomasz Sta≈Ñko, Don Cherry, Elvin Jones, Gilberto Gil, Lee Konitz, Joe Henderson, Kenny Wheeler and Jon Balke. He said that it was a huge honor and a great opportunity, emphasizing that it would not jeopardize anything with Meshuggah. \"I will be able to do the tours and come back to classes. But this does mean that I will be playing and writing a lot of jazz in the next few years between Meshuggah tours.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\nNica Group ‚Äî Lounge (2002)\nTime Requiem ‚Äî Time Requiem (2002)\nMeshuggah ‚Äî obZen (2008)\nMeshuggah ‚Äî Alive (2010)\nMeshuggah ‚Äî Koloss (2012)\nMeshuggah ‚Äî The Violent Sleep of Reason (2016)\nMeshuggah ‚Äî Immutable (2022)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMeshuggah at Allmusic\nMeshuggah official website\nMeshuggah at Nuclear Blast Europe\nMeshuggah at Nuclear Blast USA",

Thordendal, however, continued playing under a different name with new band members.\nMeshuggah was formed in 1987 by lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Jens Kidman, and took the name Meshuggah from the Yiddish word for \"crazy\" (ultimately derived from the Hebrew word ◊û÷∞◊©◊Å◊ï÷º◊í÷∏◊¢‚Äé). Kidman found the word in an American street slang dictionary. The band recorded several demos before Kidman left, which prompted the remaining members to disband. Kidman then formed a new band, Calipash, with guitarist Thordendal, bassist Peter Nordin and drummer Niklas Lundgren.

Helgesen and drummer Kristoffer Vold Austrheim under the name The Headless Children, a cover band of Slayer and Kreator. A year later singer Erik Borgen and guitarist Kenneth Bergsagel joined the group.\nThey changed the name to Carnal Tomb, then Borgen left the band and Helgesen became the singer/bassist with the female voice of Linn Achre Tveit (Keltziva). Elin Overskott joined the band as a keyboard player.\nThis was the first line-up of Dismal Euphony, officially formed in 1995. In the same year, the group composed the demo Spellbound. After this publication, they were signed by Napalm Records. Here they produced other albums like Soria Moria slott, Autumn Leaves: The Rebellion of Tides and the Lady Ablaze EP (which already features Anja Natasha as female singer).\nLater, Dismal Euphony joined Nuclear Blast and released All Little Devils, with the new female singer Anja Natasha.\nTheir last album is Python Zero.

Some of the members originated from other bands such as Green Carnation, Carpathian Forest, Trail of Tears, Dismal Euphony and In the Woods. In 2004, the Forthcoming Addiction demo, containing four songs, was recorded at DUB studio. The band signed a two album record deal with Sound Riot Records in September 2004, but due to the touring of some members with their other bands at the beginning the year, the production of The Masquerade was not finished until March 2005. In July 2005 the German label Massacre Records became interested in the band, and Sound Riot Records licensed the Chain Collector album to them. Massacre Records released The Masquerade in Europe, Canada, and Australia in November 2005, while Sound Riot Records released their edition in December 2005. The band parted ways with Sound Riot and released the second album, Unrestrained in 2007.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nG√∏ran Bomann - guitar\nSvenn Aksel Henriksen - vocals\nAnders Kobro - drums\nMartin Eltvik - bass\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nKjetil Nordhus - vocals\nKjell Jacobsen - guitar\nRunar Hansen - guitar\n\n\n== Session members ==\nHanne Kolst√∏ - vocals\nEndre Kirkesola - bass, keyboards\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe Masquerade (2005)\nUnrestrained (2008)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChain Collector's official website\nChain Collector at Encyclopaedia Metallum\nWaldemar Sorychta (born 30 October 1967) is a Polish heavy metal record producer and musician who has lived in Germany since 1982.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHe initially worked with German thrash metal band Despair, founded in 1986.\nIn 1994 he took part in the recording of the album Jesus Killing Machine by supergroup Voodoocult, led by German rock singer Phillip Boa featuring former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo among others.

B. Yeats that was published in The Rose in 1893. The poem is one of many early Yeatsian lyrical poems which use the symbol of the rose. The poem consists of twelve rhyming couplets in iambic pentameter.\n\n\n== Text ==\n\n\n== Commentary and Interpretation ==\n\nThe symbol of the rose in \"To the Rose upon the Rood of Time\" is firstly one that is constant, binding past and present through its spiritual and romantic referents. Stephen Coote notes that the rose on the rood was a symbol worn around the neck of those belonging to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn: the \"female\" rose is impaled upon the \"male\" cross. The union of these two elements was intended to help the wearer transcend beyond the physical and into the spiritual: \"the rose could also be seen as intellectual, spiritual and eternal beauty impaled upon the world and suffering with mankind as transcendence becomes immanence.\"\nAs a symbol of constancy, the rose is also the symbol of Yeats's undying love for Maud Gonne, as well as the symbol for Ireland herself as a homeland, suffering and dying on the cross, beautiful, tragic, hoping for resurrection. Although Ireland suffers, she remains eternally beautiful, an unchanging factor that transcends time. Whatever the referent, or referents, the permanence of the rose is clear, as it is the \"Red Rose, proud Rose, sad Rose of all my days\" (line 1). In order for Yeats to tell of the great Celtic heroes, the rose must come near, presumably because the rose has witnessed and embodied the sufferings of the people long past (line 2).\nFurthermore, the rose is invited to: \"Come near, that no more blinded by man‚Äôs fate,/ I find under the boughs of love and hate,/ In all poor foolish things that live a day,/ Eternal beauty wandering on her way\" (lines 9-12). \"Eternal beauty\" is the rose, personified at the end of the stanza, or at the very least made female; however, the word \"eternal\" is the word to note. The rose always was, and is, and will be forever on the \"Rood of Time.\nThe poem is settled in the rose, to the point that the poem‚Äôs tone is one of sweet, suffering melancholy, a tone that is reaching for the sublime. In the 1890s, says Stephen Coote, Yeats was concerned for the \"spiritual regeneration of his people\": he felt that a spiritual posture of awe, a posture taken before those things that were excellent, beautiful, and full of grandeur, was necessary to achieve that regeneration. The Oxford Dictionary notes that the etymology of \"sublime\" renders a Latin root, sublimus, meaning \"below the threshold\". The sublime, then, is that which is so beautiful it borders on the spiritual or the divine: Yeats poses the rose as a starting point for spiritual regeneration, and surrounds this symbol with the beautiful lyricism, euphony, rhyme and meter which characterizes his early poetry.\nThe repeated phrase \"come near\" has the feel of an incantation: the rose's proximity, so close, and yet leaving a space large enough for \"the rose-breath to fill\", contributes to the feeling of being on the verge of the divine (line 14). The lack of complete and utter communion with the rose gives the poem an air of sweet suffering that seems necessary in order to achieve the sublime.\nThe suffering in the \"sad Rose\", however, also lends an anxiety to the poem's melancholy, an anxiety that is supported by the allusions to the Irish heroes, buried interminably in Irish ground and in Irish memory. The Druid, a priest, magician and soothsayer of the ancient Celtic religion, long an extinct specimen of Ireland, is here described with romantic and wonderful qualities: \"wood-nurtured, quiet-eyed\" (line 4). Yeats mourns the lack of the good in occult religion of the past; furthermore, the mention of Cuchulain and Fergus recalls their tragic ends.\nCuchulain was a mythological hero with an Achilles-like story, an unbeatable warrior defeated because of a small weakness. He was betrayed by his enemies and died at the ",

Helgesen and drummer Kristoffer Vold Austrheim under the name The Headless Children, a cover band of Slayer and Kreator. A year later singer Erik Borgen and guitarist Kenneth Bergsagel joined the group.\nThey changed the name to Carnal Tomb, then Borgen left the band and Helgesen became the singer/bassist with the female voice of Linn Achre Tveit (Keltziva). Elin Overskott joined the band as a keyboard player.\nThis was the first line-up of Dismal Euphony, officially formed in 1995. In the same year, the group composed the demo Spellbound. After this publication, they were signed by Napalm Records. Here they produced other albums like Soria Moria slott, Autumn Leaves: The Rebellion of Tides and the Lady Ablaze EP (which already features Anja Natasha as female singer).\nLater, Dismal Euphony joined Nuclear Blast and released All Little Devils, with the new female singer Anja Natasha."

In July 2005 the German label Massacre Records became interested in the band, and Sound Riot Records licensed the Chain Collector album to them. Massacre Records released The Masquerade in Europe, Canada, and Australia in November 2005, while Sound Riot Records released their edition in December 2005.

Stephen Coote notes that the rose on the rood was a symbol worn around the neck of those belonging to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn: the \"female\" rose is impaled upon the \"male\" cross. The union of these two elements was intended to help the wearer transcend beyond the physical and into the spiritual: \"the rose could also be seen as intellectual, spiritual and eternal beauty impaled upon the world and suffering with mankind as transcendence becomes immanence.\""

                "content": "As a symbol of constancy, the rose is also the symbol of Yeats's undying love for Maud Gonne, as well as the symbol for Ireland herself as a homeland, suffering and dying on the cross, beautiful, tragic, hoping for resurrection. Although Ireland suffers, she remains eternally beautiful, an unchanging factor that transcends time. Whatever the referent, or referents, the permanence of the rose is clear, as it is the \"Red Rose, proud Rose, sad Rose of all my days\" (line 1). In order for Yeats to tell of the great Celtic heroes, the rose must come near, presumably because the rose has witnessed and embodied the sufferings of the people long past (line 2)."

The rose always was, and is, and will be forever on the \"Rood of Time."

                "content": "The poem is settled in the rose, to the point that the poem‚Äôs tone is one of sweet, suffering melancholy, a tone that is reaching for the sublime. In the 1890s, says Stephen Coote, Yeats was concerned for the \"spiritual regeneration of his people\": he felt that a spiritual posture of awe, a posture taken before those things that were excellent, beautiful, and full of grandeur, was necessary to achieve that regeneration. The Oxford Dictionary notes that the etymology of \"sublime\" renders a Latin root, sublimus, meaning \"below the threshold\". The sublime, then, is that which is so beautiful it borders on the spiritual or the divine: Yeats poses the rose as a starting point for spiritual regeneration, and surrounds this symbol with the beautiful lyricism, euphony, rhyme and meter which characterizes his early poetry."

                "content": "The repeated phrase \"come near\" has the feel of an incantation: the rose's proximity, so close, and yet leaving a space large enough for \"the rose-breath to fill\", contributes to the feeling of being on the verge of the divine (line 14). The lack of complete and utter communion with the rose gives the poem an air of sweet suffering that seems necessary in order to achieve the sublime.\nThe suffering in the \"sad Rose\", however, also lends an anxiety to the poem's melancholy, an anxiety that is supported by the allusions to the Irish heroes, buried interminably in Irish ground and in Irish memory. The Druid, a priest, magician and soothsayer of the ancient Celtic religion, long an extinct specimen of Ireland, is here described with romantic and wonderful qualities: \"wood-nurtured, quiet-eyed\" (line 4). Yeats mourns the lack of the good in occult religion of the past; furthermore, the mention of Cuchulain and Fergus recalls their tragic ends."
