{"page_content": "Meshuggah () is a Swedish extreme metal band formed in Ume\u00e5 in 1987. Since 2004, the band's lineup consists of founding members Jens Kidman (lead vocals) and Fredrik Thordendal (lead guitar), alongside rhythm guitarist M\u00e5rten Hagstr\u00f6m, drummer Tomas Haake and bassist Dick L\u00f6vgren. Since its formation, the band has released nine studio albums, six EPs and eight music videos. Their latest studio album, Immutable, was released in April 2022 via Atomic Fire Records.\nMeshuggah has become known for their innovative musical style and their complex, polymetered song structures and polyrhythms. They rose to fame as a significant act in extreme underground music, became an influence for modern metal bands, and gained a cult following. The band was labelled as one of the ten most important hard rock and heavy metal bands by Rolling Stone and as the most important band in metal by Alternative Press. In the late 2000s, the band was an inspiration for the djent subgenre.\nIn 2006 and 2009, Meshuggah was nominated for two Swedish Grammis Awards for their albums Catch Thirtythree and obZen, respectively. In 2018, the band was nominated for a Grammy Award for their song \"Clockworks\" under the \"Best Metal Performance\" category. The band has performed in various international festivals, including Ozzfest and Download, and embarked on the obZen world tour from 2008 to 2010, and also the \"Ophidian Trek\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and Contradictions Collapse (1987\u20131994) ===\n\nIn 1985, guitarist Fredrik Thordendal formed a band in Ume\u00e5, a university town in northern Sweden with a population of 105,000. The band, originally named Metallien, recorded a number of demo tapes, after which it disbanded. Thordendal, however, continued playing under a different name with new band members.\nMeshuggah was formed in 1987 by lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Jens Kidman, and took the name Meshuggah from the Yiddish word for \"crazy\" (ultimately derived from the Hebrew word \u05de\u05b0\u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05bc\u05d2\u05b8\u05e2\u200e). Kidman found the word in an American street slang dictionary. The band recorded several demos before Kidman left, which prompted the remaining members to disband. Kidman then formed a new band, Calipash, with guitarist Thordendal, bassist Peter Nordin and drummer Niklas Lundgren. Kidman, who also played guitar, and Thordendal decided to restore the name Meshuggah for the new band.\nIn 1989, Meshuggah released the self-titled, three-song EP Meshuggah, which is commonly known as Psykisk Testbild (a title that could be translated as \"Psychological Test-Picture\"). This 12\" (30 cm) vinyl EP had only 1,000 copies released, sold by local record store Garageland. The EP's back cover features the band members with cheese doodles on their faces.\nAfter replacing drummer Niklas Lundgren with Tomas Haake in 1990, Meshuggah signed a contract with German heavy metal record label Nuclear Blast and recorded its debut full-length album, Contradictions Collapse. The LP, originally entitled (All this because of) Greed, was released in 1991. The album received positive reviews, but was not a commercial success. Soon after, Kidman decided to concentrate on vocals, and guitarist M\u00e5rten Hagstr\u00f6m, who had already played in a band with Haake when they were in sixth grade, was recruited. The new lineup recorded the EP None at Tonteknik Recordings in Ume\u00e5 in 1994 for release later that year. A Japanese version was also released, including lyrics printed in Japanese.\nDuring this period, Thordendal, who was working as a carpenter, severed the tip of his left middle finger, while Haake injured his hand in a router accident. As a result, the band was unable to perform for several months. Thordendal's fingertip was later reattached, and he went on to make a full recovery. The Selfcaged EP was recorded in April and May 1994, but its release was delayed to later in 1995 due to the accidents.\n\n\n=== Destroy Erase Improve (1995\u20131997) ===\n\nIn January 1995, Meshuggah undertook a short European tour organized by its r\nMeshuggah is a Swedish extreme metal band formed in 1987 in Ume\u00e5. Meshuggah is known for its use of extended polymetric passages, complex time signatures, dissonant guitar riffs, and harsh vocals. As of 2008, the band consists of vocalist Jens Kidman, guitarists Fredrik Thordendal and M\u00e5rten Hagstr\u00f6m, bassist Dick L\u00f6vgren and drummer Tomas Haake.\nMeshuggah's first release was a self-titled three-song 12\" vinyl EP, Meshuggah, which is commonly known as Psykisk Testbild, although that title is not printed anywhere. Only 1000 copies were released by local record store Garageland in Ume\u00e5. After signing to German heavy metal record label Nuclear Blast, Meshuggah released its debut album Contradictions Collapse in 1991. Meshuggah's second album, Destroy Erase Improve, was released in 1995.\nThordendal's side project's album, Sol Niger Within, was released in 1997, as was the next Meshuggah EP, The True Human Design. These were followed by the next full-length album, Chaosphere, in 1998.\nA collection of demos (from Meshuggah) and rare recordings were released as the Rare Trax album in 2001. In 2002 the band released their next album, Nothing. Meshuggah was not satisfied with the production of the album and later re-recorded the guitars for the re-release in 2006, which also includes a bonus DVD that features the band's appearance at the Download 2005 festival, along with the official music videos for \"Rational Gaze\", \"Shed\" and \"New Millennium Cyanide Christ\". Meshuggah released I in 2004, a single 21-minute track, and in 2005 the band released the next full-length album, Catch Thirtythree, a 47-minute song divided up into 13 movements, the only album with programmed drums. In 2008, Meshuggah released obZen, followed by Koloss in 2012 and The Violent Sleep of Reason in 2016. Their newest album, Immutable, was released in 2022.\n\n\n== Studio albums ==\n\n\n== Live albums ==\n\n\n== Compilation albums ==\n\n\n== EPs ==\n\n\n== Music videos ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMeshuggah's official website\nNothing is the fourth studio album by Swedish extreme metal band Meshuggah, originally released in 2002. The album entered the Billboard 200 chart at number 165, slightly higher than the band's following effort, Catch Thirtythree.\nA last-minute decision to join 2002's Ozzfest tour forced the band to mix the album in two days and to master it in one. As a result, the album had its guitars and drums re-recorded for a remastered re-release in 2006.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\n\nThe songs on this album consist of slower tempos and a heavy focus on groove instead of the thrash metal style of previous albums. Jazz fusion elements such as the interludes found in some songs on the band's Destroy Erase Improve album are still present in this release.\nThis is also the first album on which guitarists Fredrik Thordendal and M\u00e5rten Hagstr\u00f6m experimented with 8-string guitars by re-recording the guitar tracks, replacing the original performances made using detuned 7-string guitars, due in part to their custom Nevborn guitars not being ready.\n\n\n== Release and reception ==\n\nThe track \"Rational Gaze\" was promoted with three music videos. The first was a repetitive black-and-white sequence of pictures, and did not have much connection with the song structure; the second version, directed by Torbj\u00f6rn Oyesvold, featured a blue-greenish environment with the band performing, heavy post-processed by blurry video filters; the third version, entitled \"Mr. Kidman Delirium Version\", was not an official video, but rather a handicam of Jens Kidman performing as his bandmates, with the help of different wigs. In January 2018, Loudwire named Nothing their favorite djent album.\nNothing has sold over 95,000 copies in the US.\n\n\n=== Re-release ===\nA re-recorded and remastered version of the album was released on 31 October 2006. The new version features new rhythm guitar tracks re-recorded with 8-string guitars. The drums were also re-recorded by using the original drum hits as triggers for new audio produced with virtual drum software. The vocals were not re-recorded, but were given effects processing.\nThere are two songs significantly modified from their original version. These include the tempo of \"Nebulous\" which was lowered, and the track length of \"Obsidian\" was nearly doubled with the ending fadeout removed.\nThe re-release also includes a DVD containing music videos and their Download Festival performance in 2005, as well as modified cover art.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nOriginal 2002 Release:\n\n2006 Remastered Edition:\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nJens Kidman \u2212 vocals\nFredrik Thordendal \u2212 lead guitar, bass, rhythm guitar on the 2006 re-release\nM\u00e5rten Hagstr\u00f6m \u2212 rhythm guitar, bass\nTomas Haake \u2212 drums, spoken vocals (4, 8, 9), artwork\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\nKoloss is the seventh studio album by Swedish extreme metal band Meshuggah, released on 23 March 2012 in Germany, on 26 March in the rest of Europe, and on March 27 in North America, by Nuclear Blast.\n\n\n== Background ==\nTomas Haake stated, \"As always, we try to take our music in a slightly different direction with each album and with Koloss, we feel that we really nailed what we were going for. Organic brutality, viscera and groove all crammed into a 54-minute metalicious treat, best avoided by the faint of heart!!\"\nThe Koloss album was different from others in terms of cooperation and making music together. Fredrik and M\u00e5rten worked together in creating a couple of songs together. Jens Kidman who retired from guitar playing since the album Contradictions Collapse composed \"Behind the Sun\".\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe album was released on 23 March 2012 in Germany, 26 March in the rest of Europe and on March 27 in North America. It was released as a standard compact disc, as a digipak version featuring a bonus DVD, as a limited edition boxed set \"magic cube\" (a mock-Rubik's Cube featuring the album artwork, available only through Nuclear Blast mail-order), and a double-LP pressed on brown vinyl.\nThe album debuted at number 17 in the United States, with first week sales of 18,342 copies, the band's and record label's highest position on the charts. Koloss also debuted at number 27 on the Canadian Albums Chart.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nKoloss received generally favorable reviews. Kory Grow of Spin Magazine called it \"the first real contender for the genre's album of the year\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n=== I Am Colossus EP ===\n\"I Am Colossus\" was released as a two-track EP.

It was released on April 1, 2022, via Atomic Fire Records, making it the band's first studio album to not be released through Nuclear Blast.\n\n\n== Background ==\nGuitarist M\u00e5rten Hagstr\u00f6m stated \u201cThe title Immutable fits perfectly for where we are as a band,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re older now. Most of us are in our 50s now, and we\u2019ve settled into who we are. Even though we\u2019ve been experimenting all along, I also think we\u2019ve been the same since day one.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cThe way we approach things and why we still make new albums, and why we still sound the way we do, it\u2019s immutable. Humanity is immutable, too. We commit the same mistakes over and over. And we are immutable. We do what we do, and we don\u2019t change.\u201d\nIn addition, certain Meshuggah songs on Spotify leaked a URL, which was https://immutable.se/. Clicking the link would give you a teaser of the song \"Ligature Marks\" and the release date.\nThe songs \"The Abysmal Eye\", \"Light the Shortening Fuse\" and \"I Am That Thirst\" were published as singles before the album release. Music videos were released for \"The Abysmal Eye\" and \"Broken Cog\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nImmutable has received universal acclaim from critics with a score 83 out of 100 on Metacritic. Thom Jurek of AllMusic wrote: \"Ultimately, Immutable delivers the very essence of Meshuggah. While comfortable in their collective skin, they continue expanding their reach by obliterating \u2013 hell, nearly swallowing \u2013 metal's genre boundaries in their long, relentless search for the undiscovered.\"\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Meshuggah ===\nJens Kidman \u2013 vocals\nFredrik Thordendal \u2013 lead guitar on 2, 6, 8, 11\nM\u00e5rten Hagstr\u00f6m \u2013 rhythm and lead guitars, backing vocals on 11, whispers on 1.\nDick L\u00f6vgren \u2013 bass\nTomas Haake \u2013 drums, spoken word on 11\n\n\n=== Production ===\nRickard Bengtsson and Staffan Karlsson \u2013 mixing\nVlado Meller \u2013 mastering\nLuminokaya \u2013 artwork\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\nMeshuggah, also known as Psykisk Testbild (Pronounced \"see-kisk test-build\") is the debut EP by Swedish extreme metal band Meshuggah.

It was released as a 12\" vinyl record, limited to 1000 copies, by local record store Garageland in Ume\u00e5. This is the only Meshuggah record featuring drummer Niclas Lundgren. Tomas Haake later replaced Lundgren on drums. The track \"Cadaverous Mastication\" was included on their first studio album, Contradictions Collapse.

Me and Fredrik would just jam on something, and when we found something that was kind of cool, he would walk into the control room. I would just record drums and it wasn't a set pattern, I would just kind of stray away from the pattern, but just keep going in that vibe. Then we had to chart everything and go bar by bar to record the guitars afterwards, because it's all just random.\" Thordendal would later post the chart of the first part of the song on his Instagram account.\nHaake later commented that the song was \"originally recorded for Jason Popson's Fractured Transmitter record label\" and that it was a \"'one-off' that Nuclear Blast gave us the go-ahead for \u2014 as we were under contract with them.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nThe original vinyl release has track 1 on side A, and tracks 2-4 on side B while the 2016 re-issue only has track 1\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nTomas Haake \u2013 drums\nM\u00e5rten Hagstr\u00f6m \u2013 rhythm guitar\nJens Kidman \u2013 vocals\nFredrik Thordendal \u2013 lead guitar, bass\n\n\n== References ==\nNone is the second EP by Swedish extreme metal band Meshuggah.

While sources such as The Guardian and Guitar World describe djent as a genre, some notable musicians including Randy Blythe (Lamb of God) and Stephen Carpenter (Deftones) say it is not.\n\n\n== Development ==\nFredrik Thordendal, lead guitarist of Swedish band Meshuggah, is considered the originator of the djent technique. However, the band did not coin the term itself. In a 2018 interview by Rauta, Meshuggah guitarist M\u00e5rten Hagstr\u00f6m apologized for the band's role in creating the \"djent\" style of guitar playing, calling it \"a drunk misunderstanding\".\nOther bands important in the development of the style are Animals as Leaders, Periphery, Tesseract, and Textures.\nThe scene has grown rapidly, and members of the original online community, including the bands Chimp Spanner, Sithu Aye, and Monuments, have gone on to tour and release albums commercially. Other bands influenced by djent include A Life once lost, Veil of Maya, Vildhjarta, and Xerath. Born of Osiris have also been described as being inspired by the djent movement. Furthermore, Hacktivist and DVSR are djent bands that use rapping as a primary vocal style.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nDjent as a style is characterized by progressive, rhythmic, and technical complexity accompanied by a use of polymetric groove. An example is the song \"Cafo\" by Animals as Leaders. It typically features heavily-distorted, palm-muted guitar chords, syncopated riffs, and poly-meters alongside virtuosic soloing. Another common feature is the use of extended range guitars that are seven-string, eight-string, and nine-string, or even more strings.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nSome members of the metal community have criticized the term \"djent\", either treating it as a short-lived fad, openly condemning it, or questioning its validity as a genre. However, bands such as Tesseract and Animals as Leaders have received positive critical reception and multiple awards. Post-metal band Rosetta is noted as saying, \"Maybe we should start calling doom metal 'DUNNN'\". In response to a question about \"djent\", Lamb of God vocalist Randy Blythe stated in 2011, \"There is no such thing as 'djent'; it's not a genre\". Deftones guitarist Stephen Carpenter similarly opined in 2016 that \"I thoroughly can get djent, I even have great appreciation for the bands, and I mean Meshuggah is one of my favorite bands. But it's just not a genre. It's just metal\". In an interview with Guitar Messenger, Periphery guitarist Misha Mansoor said:\n\nI was looking for gear that was djenty. I was like: 'Are these pickups djenty?' For some reason it caught on, but completely in the wrong way, because people think it's a style of music and they think it's a style of music I play.\nIn a later interview with Freethinkers Blog, Mansoor stated that he felt djent had become \"this big umbrella term for any sort of progressive band, and also any band that will [use] off-time chugs [...] You also get bands like Scale the Summit [who are referred to as] a djent band [when] 80% of their stuff sounds like clean channel, and it's all beautiful and pretty, you know [...] In that way, I think it's cool because it groups really cool bands together [...] We are surrounded by a lot of bands that I respect, but at the same time, I don't think people know what djent is either [...] It's very unclear\". Later in the interview, he stated, \"If you call us djent, that's fine. I mean, I would never self-apply the term, but at the same time, it's just so vague that I don't know what to make of it\". In 2023, Periphery directly referenced the term's controversy with the subtitle of their seventh studio album, Periphery V: Djent is not a Genre.\nTosin Abasi of Animals as Leaders takes a more lenient view of the term, stating that there are specific characteristics that are common to djent bands, and as a result the term can be legitimately used as a genre. While stating tha\nobZen is the sixth studio album by Swedish extreme metal band Meshuggah. It was released in Europe on 7 March 2008, and in North America on 11 March 2008 by Nuclear Blast. Tomas Haake made his return as a studio drummer for the record after the Drumkit from Hell drum software was used on Catch Thirtythree. It is also the first album on which bassist Dick Lovgren performs despite having been a member of the band since 2004; this is due to the bass having been digitally programmed on the previous album, Catch Thirtythree, and the bass having been performed by guitarist Fredrik Thordendal on the previous I EP. The release of the album was followed by their first world tour. A music video was filmed for a shorter version of the song \"Bleed\". A two-disc vinyl re-issue was released on 22 March 2019 through Nuclear Blast. A remastered version was released 31 March 2023 for the 15th anniversary through Atomic Fire.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn an interview with Revolver, drummer Tomas Haake stated that obZen would be a collective return to the band's past works, signalling a shift in direction away from their previous effort, Catch Thirtythree. \"We've got some fast, intense songs and hectic, heavy stuff that draws from all the things we've done in the past.\"\nThe album was originally planned for release in November 2007, prior to a European tour featuring Meshuggah and The Dillinger Escape Plan. The recording process for obZen took longer than expected and led the band to drop out of the tour, later explaining on their official website that the \"album-promotional\" aspect of the touring no longer applied and that they would rather focus their priorities on getting the record finished.\nIn an interview, Haake commented further on the time taken to record the album, saying, \"This time around we took almost six months to do all the recording and the sampling [...] we definitely took our time\". Drumkit from Hell was used on the album, but not programmed as Catch Thirtythree was. Drumkit from Hell was an auxiliary sound source. He elaborated on the concept of the album in another interview, saying: \"If you haven't figured it out yet, obZen means that mankind has found its 'zen' in the obscure and obscene.\" Haake also mentioned his favorite track on this album is \"Dancers to a Discordant System\". Meshuggah performed the song live for the first time at the opening show of the Koloss tour in Bristol, England, on 12 April 2012. It was performed as the closing song for every show on the tour since then.\nThe song \"Bleed\" was released as DLC for the Rock Band video games via the Rock Band Network on 18 June 2010.\n\n\n== Album art ==\nAlthough Meshuggah had not done so in the past, the album art of obZen was outsourced. With a vision of what they wanted the artwork to be, Meshuggah made use of cross-media artist Joachim Luetke. In an interview with Nuclear Blast USA, Haake and Hagstr\u00f6m explain that the artwork features a photograph of a male model in the \"zen lotus position\" with the bottom half of the photograph being from a female model. This is because the male model could not perform the position, making the figure androgynous. The model is covered in blood, which is explained as a metaphor for mankind finding peace of mind through obscenity. Additionally, each of the three blood-smeared hands poses in the shape of the number six, which is meant to symbolize the inherently evil nature of man.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nobZen was acclaimed by critics and fans alike. On Metacritic, it has a score of 83 out of 100 based on 6 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nThe album was praised for its consistency, and the band for their continued musical evolution, with Nick Terry from Decibel saying, \"Three years on, and we have a new reference point to chart Meshuggah's musical evolution. And yeah, things are evolving nicely\".\nThe album was also praised for the band revisiting their early thrash metal-oriented approach on tracks like \"Combustion\" and \"Bleed\", while still \nFredrik Carl Thordendal (born 11 February 1970) is a Swedish musician best known as the lead guitarist and backing vocalist for the extreme metal band Meshuggah, of which he is a founding member. Along with Meshuggah's rhythm guitarist M\u00e5rten Hagstr\u00f6m, Thordendal was rated No. 35 by Guitar World in their list of the top 100 greatest heavy metal guitarists of all time.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Meshuggah ===\n\nThordendal began his career when he formed 'Metallien,' a heavily Metallica-influenced band, in his hometown of Ume\u00e5 in 1985. The band later changed their name to Meshuggah and released their first LP, Psykisk Testbild, in 1989. Starting as a thrash metal band, Meshuggah's music gradually evolved into a more progressive sound. This sound has become influential to other bands, such as Periphery, whose core member, Misha Mansoor, was instrumental in coining the term \"Djent\" to refer to the commonly utilized technique of playing heavily muted, extended power chords found in Meshuggah's music. Thordendal has been widely recognized in the metal community for his work with Meshuggah.\nSometime in the 90s, before the release of Destroy Erase Improve, Thordendal was involved in a carpentry accident at work in which he cut off the tip of his left middle finger. The fingertip was sewn back on, and after a significant amount of re-learning and practicing, he regained full proficiency on the guitar within a year or so.\n\n\n=== Fredrik Thordendal's Special Defects: Sol Niger Within ===\nUnder the name Fredrik Thordendal's Special Defects, Thordendal released a solo album in 1997 titled Sol Niger Within with Ultimate Audio Entertainment. The album was remixed and re-released by Ultimate Audio Entertainment and Relapse Records in 1999 under the title Sol Niger Within Version 3.33. The re-release contains two bonus tracks but omits several parts of the original version. The newly mastered version of SNW was also released for the first time on vinyl in 2016 by Husaria Records, an American label specializing in audiophile releases. The album's original material was pressed in both a lacquer cut variant (500 units) and a Direct Metal Mastering variant (500 units). Thordendal also contributed to several tracks for drummer Morgan \u00c5gren's Mats/Morgan Band.\nRegarding a second Special Defects album, Thordendal states, \"It's actually been messing with my head for years now. I haven't really found the time to get the project going. This is a project that I will work on for a longer time, with no rush whatsoever, to make it the best I possibly can. I'm looking forward to making it because I think it will sound so different from anything I've ever heard before.\"\n\n\n=== Other projects and contributions ===\n\nThordendal has been involved in numerous side projects, such as XXX Atomic Toejam with Petter Marklund. The project initially released a 7\" two-track single titled 'Celebration' under the name Sep\u00fclchre Inc. They later adopted the name XXX Atomic Toejam and issued an MCD entitled A Gathering of the Tribes for the First / Last Human Be-In on Cold Meat Industry, as well as featuring a track on the Karmanik Collection compilation. A full-length album was long announced but never materialized. Thordendal also played bass for Petter Marklund's solo project, Memorandum, and, together with Marklund, remixed tracks on the 1995 compilation album Ars Moriendi.\nIn 2010, Thordendal recorded some drum tracks with Morgan \u00c5gren of the Swedish prog-rock band Kaipa and Dirk Verbeuren of Soilwork.\nSeveral of Thordendal's demos have been released on the internet as MP3s or as videos on YouTube. Demo 33 was used to demonstrate a MIDI breath controller created by Johan Haake, which is used on several Meshuggah songs, including Future Breed Machine.\nThordendal is also a notable producer, having produced all of Meshuggah's recent material as well as releases for various other bands, including Switzerland's Fragment.\nThordendal is featured in the Darkane track 'Psychic Pain' from t\nThe Violent Sleep of Reason is the eighth studio album by Swedish extreme metal band Meshuggah. It was released on 7 October 2016 via Nuclear Blast. This album was recorded live in the studio, simultaneously with all members, rather than recording each instrument separately as is more common for modern recording. The band announced the new album, its title, and track list via Blabbermouth.net and Revolver magazine on 5 August 2016.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe album's title was loosely inspired by The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters, an etching by Spanish painter Francisco Goya. The album's title and lyrical themes are a commentary on terrorism, extremist views on ideals, religious dogma, and the violent implications of \"being asleep, so to speak, or not reacting to what's going on in the proper way\". Concerning the album artwork, Tomas Haake stated:\n\n\"It was a hard one in the sense that you don't immediately have a visual to the title The Violent Sleep of Reason \u2013 how do you portray that?\n\"So when discussing this with Keerych Luminokaya, who also did the artwork for our 25th anniversary box set along with the artwork for Koloss, we just let him loose on that idea and how to portray that.\n\"What you're seeing on the artwork is basically a human being that's been in stasis for a long time. The vines were the original idea \u2013 they're growing into him. But it's a body that's been asleep for so long that it's been taken over by something else.\"\n\nIn an attempt to depart from the production on previous albums like Koloss and obZen, this album was recorded live. According to Haake, this allowed the band to capture their sound more \"honestly\" and to capture the \"rawness\" of albums from the late '80s and early '90s that \"inspired us when we were growing up.\" Haake elaborated:\n\n\"If you put it all together using computers then you often have to fix problems after the fact. I've gone back to records where I've not known every drum part. And once you do that you can start with drums and then just add layers of guitars and then bass and it all sounds perfect.\n\"ObZen and Koloss are great albums but, to me, they are a little too perfect. It didn't really capture what we sounded like honestly.\n\n\"But where we recorded live you get to hear the push and pull, one person might be a little ahead and the other might be a little behind. If you kill that, you can kill the energy.\"Bassist Dick L\u00f6vgren for the first time contributed significantly to the writing of most songs for the album. Lead guitarist Fredrik Thordendal wrote the least on this album than ever in his career due to rumored side project which is a second album continued from Sol Niger Within. This caused him to rollout from live performances. M\u00e5rten Hagstr\u00f6m used a 28\" scale guitar instead of 29.4\" due to arthritis problems to shoulder.\n\n\n== Release ==\nIn advance of the album, three songs were released on the YouTube channel of the band's record label, Nuclear Blast. \"Born in Dissonance\", also released as a single, was uploaded on 25 August 2016; a lyric video for \"Nostrum\" was released on 15 September 2016, while the official video for \"Clockworks\" was released on 7 October 2016. On 20 September 2016 the band released a live play-through drum cam video of \"Nostrum\" highlighting Tomas Haake's drum playing. There was also a live drum play-through camera released for Clockworks released on 12 October 2016, which has over 1.5 million views worldwide.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nThe Violent Sleep of Reason has received universal acclaim from critics and fans alike. A review by Max Frank on the popular site Metalsucks.net gave the album five out of five stars and described it as a \"tour-de-force; a total deconstruction of heavy music.\" The review focuses on a paradox between what it describes as complex composition structures that seem to critique the norms of the metal genre, and some of the band members' professed ignorance of music theory. Frank states, \"Theoreticians out there might say that Violent Sl\nChaosphere is the third studio album by Swedish extreme metal band Meshuggah. It was released on 9 November 1998 by Nuclear Blast, and is the only studio album to feature bassist Gustaf Hielm. Chaosphere's sound shows the band toning down some of the thrash style of their previous releases in favor of the technical, polyrhythmic, groove-oriented sound they would continue to explore on subsequent albums. A video was made for \"New Millennium Cyanide Christ\".\nThe Japanese version of the album contains a bonus song, titled \"Unanything\", as track 9. This song was also included on the promotional card-sleeve CD as track 6.\nOn both this and the standard album release, after \"Elastic\" there is a period of silence then an unlisted and unindexed track where four of the album's songs are played at once, with volume changes making each song somewhat dominant and recognisable in the mix at different times.\nThe \"Reloaded\" re-release features five of the six tracks from The True Human Design EP.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Meshuggah ===\nJens Kidman \u2013 vocals\nFredrik Thordendal \u2013 lead guitar, keyboards\nM\u00e5rten Hagstr\u00f6m \u2013 rhythm guitar\nGustaf Hielm \u2013 bass\nTomas Haake \u2013 drums, vocals (on \"Sane\", \"The Exquisite Machinery of Torture\", and \"Futile Bread Machine (Campfire Version)\")\n\n\n=== Production ===\nDaniel Bergstrand \u2013 recording, mixdown\nFredrik Thordendal \u2013 recording, mixdown\nPeter in de Betou \u2013 mastering (at Cutting Room, Stockholm, Sweden)\nTomas Haake \u2013 artwork, design\nMeshuggah \u2013 art direction\nJohn Norhager \u2013 band photo\n\n\n== References ==\nDestroy Erase Improve is the second studio album by Swedish extreme metal band Meshuggah. It was released on 12 May 1995 by Nuclear Blast. This is the first studio album to feature rhythm guitarist M\u00e5rten Hagstr\u00f6m and the final to feature bassist Peter Nordin, as he left the band during the supporting tour due to vertigo.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nDescribing the record as \"one of the 90's definitive metallic works\", Kevin Stewart-Panko argues that Destroy Erase Improve's unique fusion of genres amounted to a new \"watermark\" for heavy metal upon its release. Metal critic Martin Popoff regards Destroy Erase Improve as the first clear demonstration of what would become the quintessential Meshuggah sound, wherein \"stutter gun\" riffs and \"upset apple cart time signatures\" are featured alongside \"bone-breaking\" percussion, an approach which resulted in considerable influence in the development of genres like mathcore and djent. Popoff suggests that Destroy Erase Improve is the clear linchpin of Meshuggah's particular style, a \"specific, nearly absurd proposal that only this band has dared to own.\"\nThe album was ranked number 42 on Rolling Stone's 50 Greatest Prog Rock Albums of All Time list. In 2017, Rolling Stone ranked Destroy Erase Improve as 77th on their list of 'The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time.' Two tracks from the album appear in the shockumentary film series Traces of Death with \"Vanished\" in the third installment and \"Future Breed Machine\" in the fourth.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Meshuggah ===\nJens Kidman \u2013 vocals\nFredrik Thordendal \u2013 lead guitar, keyboards\nM\u00e5rten Hagstr\u00f6m \u2013 rhythm guitar\nTomas Haake \u2013 drums, voices\nPeter Nordin \u2013 bass\n\n\n=== Production ===\nDaniel Bergstrand \u2013 mixing, engineering, production\nFredrik Thordendal \u2013 mixing\nMeshuggah \u2013 production, cover design\nPeter In De Betou \u2013 mastering (at Cutting Room, Stockholm)\nStefan Gillbald \u2013 cover artwork\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\nContradictions Collapse is the debut studio album by Swedish extreme metal band Meshuggah.

Originally releasing hardcore punk records, the label moved on to releasing albums by thrash metal, melodic death metal, grindcore, industrial metal, power metal and black metal bands, as well as tribute albums. It also distributes and promotes post-hardcore/metalcore labels SharpTone Records; another post-hardcore/metalcore label, Arising Empire, was in Nuclear Blast portfolio until its acquirement by Kontor New Media in 2020.\nIn October 2018, French independent label Believe Digital acquired a majority stake in Nuclear Blast.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nNuclear Blast was formed in 1987 after founder Markus Staiger traveled throughout the United States for four weeks and saw a gig of his favorite band BL'AST!. The label's first release was a vinyl compilation called Senseless Death (NB 001) featuring US hardcore bands like Attitude, Sacred Denial, Impulse Manslaughter and others.\nSwedish band Meshuggah became the first band in the history of Nuclear Blast Records to crack the Billboard 200, landing at number 165 with their 2002 album, Nothing. Meshuggah also became the first Nuclear Blast band to be reviewed in Rolling Stone magazine.\nIn 2004, Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish released Once on Nuclear Blast, which rocketed to the top of the charts in multiple countries, including Finland, Germany, Norway, Greece, Sweden, Austria, and more. It became the first release in the company's history to reach number 1 on the German charts. Slayer released the album Repentless in 2015 which went to number 4 on the Billboard 200 making it the highest charting Nuclear Blast release in the United States.\nDuring the 2000s and 2010s, Nuclear Blast signed many veteran thrash metal bands including Slayer, Exodus, Testament, Anthrax, Kreator, Overkill, Sepultura, Destruction, Tankard, Death Angel, and Heathen.\nIn 2021, Nuclear Blast founder Markus Staiger launched a new record company called Atomic Fire GmbH.\nIn June 2022, Nuclear Blast unveiled a new logo. The logo caused some controversy when the canned water company Liquid Death jokingly noted its similarities with their logo (which also features a melting skull), inadvertedly leading to its designer, Justin Moll, receiving hate mail. Liquid Death quickly apologized for the joke, saying that it was not targeted at Moll but at Nuclear Blast, whose personnel had reportedly raised concerns over the new logo's similarities with Liquid Death's before it was implemented.\nOn 23 August 2022, the video game Saints Row was released, which features an in-game radio station that includes Nuclear Blast artists.\n\n\n== Blood Blast Distribution ==\nBlood Blast Distribution is a subsidiary of Nuclear Blast that focuses solely on the distribution of extreme music.

Originating as a line of greeting cards, Goggin expanded the concept into a cabaret show that ran for 38 weeks, and eventually into a full-length musical. The original Off-Broadway production opened December 12, 1985, running for 3,672 performances and becoming the second-longest-running Off-Broadway show in history. The show has since been adapted for television, starring Rue McClanahan, and has spawned six sequels and three spin-offs.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Nunsense concept originated as a line of greeting cards featuring a nun offering tart quips with a clerical slant. The cards caught on so quickly that Goggin decided to expand the concept into a cabaret show called The Nunsense Story, which opened for a four-day run at Manhattan's Duplex and remained for 38 weeks, encouraging its creator to expand it into a full-length theater production.\nThe original production of Nunsense, directed by Goggin, opened on December 12, 1985 at the Off-Broadway Cherry Lane Theatre, moving to the Douglas Fairbanks Theater for the majority of its ten-year run. It ran for 3,672 performances, becoming the second-longest running Off-Broadway show in history (after The Fantasticks). By the time it closed, it had become an international phenomenon translated into at least 26 languages with more than 8,000 productions worldwide. It has grossed over $500 million worldwide, and more than 25,000 women have played in Nunsense productions worldwide, including Edie Adams, Maxine Audley, Kaye Ballard, Honor Blackman, Pat Carroll, Peggy Cass, Phyllis Diller, Sally Struthers, Louise Gold, Maggie Fitzhugh and JoAnne Worley. The five-woman production won four Outer Critics Circle Awards, including best Off-Broadway musical, best book and best music. A 1985 London cast recording was made, as well as a 1986 recording with the off-Broadway cast. The show opened on London's West End at the Fortune Theatre in March 1987.\nGoggin adapted both Nunsense and Nunsense 2 for television productions with Rue McClanahan as the mother superior. Also starring in this version were Terri White as Sister Mary Hubert, Semina DeLaurentis as Sister Mary Amnesia, Christine Anderson as Sister Robert Anne and Christine Toy as Sister Mary Leo. The show and its sequels are popular choices of community theater and summer stock theatre troupes. In 2004, the \"20th Anniversary All-Star Tour\" of the show starred Kaye Ballard as Sister Mary Regina, Georgia Engel as Sister Mary Leo, Mimi Hines as Sister Mary Amnesia, Darlene Love as Sister Mary Hubert, and Lee Meriwether as Sister Robert Anne.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nFive of the 19 surviving Little Sisters of Hoboken, a one-time missionary order that ran a leper colony on an island south of France, discover that their cook, Sister Julia, Child of God, accidentally killed the other fifty-two residents of the convent with her tainted vichyssoise while they were off playing bingo with a group of Maryknolls. Upon discovering the disaster, Mother Superior had a vision in which she was told to start a greeting card company to raise funds for the burials. The greeting cards were an enormous success and, thinking there was plenty of money, the Reverend Mother bought a VCR and camcorder for the convent, leaving her with no money in the kitty to pay for the last four burials. With the deceased nuns on ice in the deep freeze, they decide to stage a variety show in the Mount Saint Helen's School auditorium to raise the necessary amount. Participating in the project are Mother Superior Mary Regina, a former circus performer who can not resist the spotlight; her competitive but dignified rival, second-in-command Sister Mary Hubert; Sister Robert Anne, a streetwise nun from Brooklyn; Sister Mary Leo, a novice who is determined to be the world's first ballerina nun; and wacky, childlike Sister Mary Amnesia, who lost her memory when a crucifix fell on her head.  The entertainment that they \nM\u00e5rten Hans Hagstr\u00f6m (born 27 April 1971) is a Swedish musician, best known as the rhythm guitarist for the extreme metal band Meshuggah. He joined the band after the release of their first album, which allowed Jens Kidman to focus on his vocal performances and give up rhythm guitar duties. He and fellow Meshuggah guitarist Fredrik Thordendal are known for their complex rhythm guitar playing. Hagstr\u00f6m has cited Rush, James Hetfield, Squarepusher, Autechre, Strapping Young Lad, and GISM as influences.\nIn a Metal Injection interview he has said, \"You can't play an instrument for the technicality of it. It's a tool you use to get what's in here and here [heart and mind] out there.\" He has also stated that when he first started learning guitar, the prevailing trend was for increasingly virtuosic lead playing, and that he decided to focus on developing his intricate rhythm guitar style instead.\nAlthough Thordendal plays most of Meshuggah's guitar solos, the two of them share songwriting duties more or less equally, with Hagstr\u00f6m notably contributing \"Nebulous\" from Nothing, \"Acrid Placidity\" from Destroy Erase Improve, and \"Neurotica\" from Chaosphere. Hagstr\u00f6m has also stepped out of his role of playing exclusively rhythm guitar with the release of Meshuggah's obZen album by playing the slower, melodic leads on the songs that he wrote, such as \"Electric Red\" and \"Pravus\".\nIn addition to this, he has contributed lyrics to some of the band's later releases, co-writing Catch 33 with Meshuggah drummer Tomas Haake and penning the entirety of the words for their abstract EP I. Hagstr\u00f6m and Haake have been playing music together since they were nine years old.\nHagstr\u00f6m, along with Thordendal, was rated #35 by Guitar World in their top 100 of the greatest heavy metal guitarists of all time.\n\n\n== Equipment ==\n\n\n=== Guitars ===\n\nHagstr\u00f6m's main guitar is an Ibanez Custom 8-String M8M which feature RG-shaped alder or Iceman-shaped swamp ash bodies with 5-piece maple/Bubinga neck-thru necks (29.4\" {746.76 mm}), rosewood fingerboards (no inlays), fixed bridge (actually an Ibanez FX-Edge fixed tremolo), one volume, one tone, and one Lundgren Model 8 pickup. He uses .9-.70 gauge strings, tuned down half a step. Up until the late '90s, both Hagstr\u00f6m and Thordendal used Ibanez 7-string guitars (initially Universe models, then single-pickup variations of the RG7620 and RG7621 for Thordendal and Hagstr\u00f6m respectively) before moving to Nevborn 8-string guitars during the Nothing era. The group found the Nevborns to be somewhat unstable while touring and when Ibanez communicated a desire to try building them 8-string guitars they accepted the offer.\nMarten Hagstrom got his custom 8 string to be modded to accommodate some arthritis issues to his shoulder. His new custom Ibanez M8M is 28\" scale length with semi-hollow body facilitated easy stage performance and studio recording. He also got a production model 27\" scale guitar (Ibanez Iron Label ARZIR28 8 String) for the other half of the stage time.\nGuitar Strings:DR Strings, Tite-Fit, LH-9 \"Lite & Heavy\" set: [.009 \u2013 .011 \u2013 .016 \u2013 .026 \u2013 .036 \u2013 .046], .052, .070 (stock gauges on the Ibanez M8M signature guitar)\nDR Strings, Tite-Fit, TF8-10 \"8 String Medium\" set: .010 \u2013 .013 \u2013 .017 \u2013 .026 \u2013 .036 \u2013 .046 \u2013 .056 \u2013 .075\nGuitar Picks:Jim Dunlop 1mm Nylon Standard\n\n\n=== Amplifiers and effects ===\nFortin Amplifiers \"Meshuggah\" custom amplifier heads\nFractal Audio Axe-Fx Ultra (as of the obZen tour)\nLine 6 Vetta II Head Units\nT.C.

He is the bass guitarist for extreme metal band Meshuggah, which he joined in 2004.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nIn his early days, L\u00f6vgren was particularly impressed with the Metallica bass guitarist Cliff Burton. He said that Burton \"was probably the main reason why I became a bassist\". L\u00f6vgren is a schooled jazz musician, influenced by Dave Holland, John Scofield, Medeski Martin & Wood, Miles Davis and Brad Mehldau. He always preferred playing with fingers; however, in his main band, Meshuggah, he plays with a pick exclusively, stating that the exact sound from the pick and distortion is strictly what Meshuggah wants to extract from the bass guitar.\nBefore joining Meshuggah, L\u00f6vgren performed with a vast array of bands in his native Sweden, first with the neo-classical metal/melodic power metal band Time Requiem, then the melodic/progressive metal band Last Tribe, the death metal band Cromlech and the power metal band Armageddon (alongside Arch Enemy guitarist Christopher Amott). In the late 1990s, L\u00f6vgren held the enviable assignment of touring bass guitarist for both Arch Enemy and In Flames.\nL\u00f6vgren joined Meshuggah in 2004 after the band lost their bass guitarist, Gustaf Hielm, in 2001. In the same year, they released their EP I, that contains just one track of the same name, that lasts twenty-one minutes. However, L\u00f6vgren did not play in Meshuggah's recording sessions until their highly successful album, obZen (2008). This was due to the album finish deadline while recording Catch Thirtythree, so the drum and bass tracks were recorded digitally. He also released a highly acclaimed fusion-jazz album, Lounge, with the Swedish Nica Group ensemble. All tracks were composed by L\u00f6vgren, and the album shows his creativity as well as jazz-styled playing skills.\nIn September 2010, L\u00f6vgren was accepted into the Gothenburg Music University to study improvisation and composition with Anders Jormin, the Swedish jazz double bass player, arranger and bandleader who has worked with numerous jazz artists, such as Bobo Stenson, Charles Lloyd, Tomasz Sta\u0144ko, Don Cherry, Elvin Jones, Gilberto Gil, Lee Konitz, Joe Henderson, Kenny Wheeler and Jon Balke. He said that it was a huge honor and a great opportunity, emphasizing that it would not jeopardize anything with Meshuggah. \"I will be able to do the tours and come back to classes. But this does mean that I will be playing and writing a lot of jazz in the next few years between Meshuggah tours.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\nNica Group \u2014 Lounge (2002)\nTime Requiem \u2014 Time Requiem (2002)\nMeshuggah \u2014 obZen (2008)\nMeshuggah \u2014 Alive (2010)\nMeshuggah \u2014 Koloss (2012)\nMeshuggah \u2014 The Violent Sleep of Reason (2016)\nMeshuggah \u2014 Immutable (2022)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMeshuggah at Allmusic\nMeshuggah official website\nMeshuggah at Nuclear Blast Europe\nMeshuggah at Nuclear Blast USA", "metadata": {"title": "Meshuggah", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meshuggah"}}
