{"page_content": "Miss International (Miss International Beauty or The International Beauty Pageant) is a Japan-based international major beauty pageant organized by the International Culture Association. First held in 1960, it is the fourth largest pageant in the world in terms of the number of national winners participating in the international contest.\nAlong with Miss World, Miss Universe, and Miss Earth, the pageant is one of the Big Four beauty pageants. The Miss International Organization and the brand are currently owned (since 1968), along with Miss International Japan, by the International Cultural Association and Miss Paris Group. The pageant crown used by the organization is supplied and patented by the Mikimoto pearl company.\nIn 2020 and again in 2021, the pageant was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe current Miss International is Andrea Rubio of Venezuela who was crowned on 26 October 2023 in Tokyo, Japan.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe pageant was created in Long Beach, California, United States in 1960, after the departure of the Miss Universe pageant to Miami Beach. Hosted in Long Beach until 1967, the pageant moved to Japan from 1968 to 1970, being hosted each year in the same city as the Expo '70. For 1971, it was held in Long Beach again, but since that time it had been held annually in Japan until 2003. Since 2004, it is held in China or Japan. The first winner of the pageant in 1960 was Stella Araneta of Colombia.\nSince then, Japan became the host country and the pageant has mostly been held in Japan, around autumn season either in October or November. The pageant is also called \"Miss International Beauty\". The pageant advocacy is to achieve a world where women can live with positivity, inner strength and individuality. The slogan of Miss International is to \"correct understanding of Japan in the international community\" and \"the realization of world peace through mutual understanding\". It has also recently adapted the slogan \"Cheer All Women\".\nThe winner of Miss International 2012, Ikumi Yoshimatsu of Japan, was stripped of her title and was not able to crown her successor due to conflict with a talent agency that threatened her safety and the pageant night itself; instead Miss International 2008, Alejandra Andreu, crowned Bea Santiago of the Philippines as Miss International 2013. Yoshimatsu was the first titleholder of the pageant from Japan to be dethroned shortly before the end of her reign. The organization was criticized for allegedly asking Yoshimatsu to skip the succession ceremony and \"play sick and shut up\" in order to avoid a scandal with a Japanese production company whose president was allegedly harassing her. In 2017, Kevin Lilliana Junaedy of Indonesia became the first Muslim woman to win Miss International. 2020 and 2021 edition was the second and third times the pageant has been cancelled since 1966 edition, because of the COVID-19 pandemic and Japanese government banned International events, following the 2020 Summer Olympics postponement.\n\n\n== Recent titleholders ==\n\n\n== Gallery of winners ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Crowns ==\n\n\n=== Gallery of Miss International crowns ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nThe Long Beach Pearl Crown (2022\u2013present) \u2013 This crown was designed by Mrs. B\u00f9i Th\u1ecb M\u1ef9 C\u1ea3nh - founder of Long Beach Pearl, the official crown sponsor of the Miss International Organization.

It consists of the annual national pageant Miss Grand Thailand, as well as the international competition Miss Grand International, to which participating rights are licensed to organizers in other countries.

The pageant was founded in Thailand amidst a political crisis, inspiring the organizers to use the slogan 'No mob, Stop the Wars' as part of its identity, later rephrased to 'Stop the War and Violence' in the following year. The pageant aims to promote peace by being against all kinds of conflicts.\nThe pageant has primarily been focusing on humanitarian issues with the reigning titleholders dedicating their year to work as the organization's spokesperson as well as involved in the charity events related to the said campaigns. For instance, corresponding with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to raise funds available for humanitarian aid, visiting and donated necessities to the internally displaced people in the refugee camps, being the guest speaker at the related events and act as the ambassador of the NGOs (e.g., Catholic Medical Mission Board, Model United Nations), or taking part in any projects of the local charitable organization in the visited countries. Before 2021, the winner of the contest, together with all runners-up, often serve as the campaigners of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, to promote the tourism industry of the pageant-based country.\nThe contest features contestants selected by licensees in each country. Its first three competitions were held in Thailand under the sponsorship of the country's government and televised worldwide via Channel 7, while subsequent events have also taken place overseas, and was broadcast via the local television channels together with the social media platforms including its official YouTube channel and Facebook page.\nIn 2019, the pageant was being held in Venezuela amid the country's political crisis; several candidates withdrew from the competition due to security concerns and visa regulation problems, such as South Korea, Cambodia, and Laos.

In its first decade, due to being a newly established pageant, almost half of the participating contestants were appointed; no national pageant was held. Nonetheless, in pageant-popular countries, especially in the Far East and the Americas, annual national pageants are usually being held to crown a winner for the Miss Grand International pageant. For example,  Miss Grand Cambodia, Miss Grand Malaysia, Miss Grand Nepal, and Miss Grand Paraguay. Some of the participatants were the runner-up or obtained the title in other national pageants, e.g. the delegates from Femina Miss India (2015\u20132021), Binibining Pilipinas (2013, 2015 \u2013 2022), Miss Mexico (2017 \u2013 2020), Felvid\u00e9k Sz\u00e9pe (2015 \u2013 2017), etc.\nDespite not being considered an economically popular event in Europe and Africa, many countries have conducted national pageants separately for Miss Grand, for instance, Albania, Kosovo, Spain, France,  Italy, and South Africa. \nIn Spain, Italy, and several countries in Asi\nMiss International 2024 will be the 62nd Miss International pageant, that is scheduled for November 12, 2024, at the Tokyo Dome City Hall in Japan.\nAndrea Rubio of Venezuela will crown her successor at the end of the event.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Location and date ===\nThe Miss International Organization announced that the pageant will take place at Tokyo Dome City Hall, Tokyo, Japan.
