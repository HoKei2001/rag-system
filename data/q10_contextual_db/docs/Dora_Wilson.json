{"page_content": "Dora Lynnell Wilson (31 August 1883 \u2013 21 November 1946) was a British-born Australian artist, best known in her adopted country of Australia for her etchings and street scenes.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDora Lynnell Wilson was born on 31 August 1883 in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Her parents were James Wilson, agent, and Annie Maria, n\u00e9e Green. The family emigrated to the state of Victoria in Australia in 1884, when Dora was a year old.\n\n\n== Education ==\nWilson was educated at Somerset School and Methodist Ladies' College in Melbourne. From 1901\u20131906 she studied at the National Gallery under Bernard Hall and Frederick McCubbin, forming friendships with fellow artists Ruth Hollick, Gwendolyn Grant, Norah Gurdon, and her partner Pegg Clarke. She also took lessons from John Mather with Jessie Traill and Janie Wilkinson Whyte.\n\n\n== Artistic career ==\nWilson was best known for her etchings, pastels and oils of still lifes and nudes. Her work was praised for her 'strong sense of colour' but also critiqued for demonstrating a 'chocolate box prettiness'.\nHer work was included in a number of notable exhibitions, including the five week Australian Exhibition of Women's Work in Melbourne, a Royal Academy exhibition of Australian art in London. In 1923 her work, 'Reve d'Or', was reproduced on the cover of Women's World and exhibited at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Fran\u00e7ais in Paris.\nHer studio at Collins Street West was the meeting place of ex\u2013Gallery School students who exhibited in 1913\u201314 as 'The Twelve Melbourne Painters.' This group included Jessie Traill, Janet Cumbrae Stewart, Norah Gurdon, Penleigh Boyd, and Lindsay Bernard Hall. Wilson was also a member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors.\nFrom the 1920s onwards she concentrated largely on street scenes, and in  1923 she was commissioned by Sir Baldwin Spencer to undertake a series of paintings of European landmarks, which saw her travelling around Europe for over two years, accompanied by the photographer Pegg Clarke. In 1928 these works were exhibited at the Beaux Arts Gallery, London, and the following year at Australia House. In the early 1930s she focused on historical scenes from Melbourne's history, with an exhibition entitled 'Milestones of Melbourne' held at the Fine Art Society Gallery in March 1935. Her work was received favorably by Arthur Streeton for being \"fresh in colour and treatment and free from the depressing appearance of black paint.\" In 1937 she joined and exhibited with Robert Menzies' Australian Academy of Art.\n\n\tDora L Wilson, Pictures Collection, State Library Victoria\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Death ==\nWilson died of cancer on 21 November 1946 and was cremated at Springvale Cemetery, Melbourne. She made a bequest to the National Gallery trustees in the amount of \u00a31100 as it was her wish to help Australian artists to travel abroad.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n1943, from 1 December; Inclusion in a group show of ninety-one paintings and etchings with Arnold Shore, Max Meldrum, John Rowell, Jas.

Joan Kerr has her death only as an estimate; \"between 1956 and 1958,\" while a 2009 exhibition sets it at 1959. Pegg Clarke claimed to be some seven years younger than Dora L Wilson, her lifelong companion, who was born in 1883. Dr. Jim Mitchell, archivist of Scotch College has proposed that she was related to Olive Clarke, secretary to Dr Colin Gilray, the college principal, from 1934 to 1953.\n\n\n== Career ==\nClarke had an early win with a picture Minnie in the October 1915 Australasian photo-review Home Portraiture Competition.\nRosebank from which she was operating before 1923 was row of terraces in Hawthorn that took its name from a 19th-century estate from which their land was subdivided. Her work featured in prominent early 20th century Australian magazines, at first in thumbnail portraits for The Bulletin. While the Australian quarterly The Home launched by Ure Smith in 1920, nominated Harold Cazneaux (1878\u20131953) as their \"Special Photographer\", Pegg Clarke, probably 8 to 12 years his younger was accorded bylines in almost every issue from its inception for photographs of stately homes and portraits of artists, and performers. During the interwar period, Clarke's clientele included rich and prominent Melbourne society figures at Government House and Flemington race track of Lady Stradbroke (wife of the Governor of Victoria), Dame Margaret Davidson (wife of the Governor of NSW), and Lady Allardyce (wife of the Governor of Tasmania).\nHer main rival, Ruth Hollick, award-winning society photographer who exhibited in Australia and internationally, and one of Australia's most successful professional photographers soon became a friend. With her professional and life partner Dorothy Izard, Hollick met the painter Dora Wilson and her lifelong companion Pegg Clarke (the pair were soon to share a studio), and together the two close couples forged a strong personal friendship. A 1937 article in The Australian Home Beautiful makes clear that despite their lasting relationship their tastes differed, with Wilson favouring period-style decor for their studio and Clarke, the modernist furnishings.\n\nBy the end of WW1 Clarke, along with her friend Hollick, were considered the leading photographers in Melbourne. Both were respected for their fashion photography, their high society portraits, especially of debutantes and brides, and their portraits of visiting celebrities such those by Clarke of actress Joan Rowell, wives of diplomats and composer/musician Margaret Sutherland. Amongst Clarke's more famous friends, and subjects of her portraits were Australian poet Dorothea Mackellar, and Dame Sybil Thorndike The Australian Gallery Directors' Council notes that, \"[t]he role of Cazneaux covering home and social photographs for magazine in Sydney was shared by Hollick and Clarke in Melbourne.\"  Hollick specialised in fashion photography and Clarke in interiors and architecture. She also provided photographic reproductions of her friend Dora Wilson's paintings to the press.\nFrom 1923 Clarke started to advertise her services with mention of her inclusions in \"The London Salon 1921\" and \"The Pittsburgh Salon 1922\", and shifted with Wilson to an upstairs studio which they shared in Linden Hall, a block of luxury flats at 403 Glenferrie Road, Malvern, then from 1927-1940s, relocated to a studio she designed at 476 Glenferrie Road, Hawthorn, opposite the private school Scotch College, the clientele and grounds of which she photographed.\n\n\n=== Europe ===\n\nNewspapers' social columns covered the couple's activities regularly, and the farewell parties when in April 1927 they readied to d\nDora De Winton was a British actress of the silent era. Born Dora Wilson in London in 1874, De Winton was a well-known drama and comedy theatre performer during the 1880s. She starred in a number of films from 1912 to 1925, especially melodramas and crime films. She began her film career working with the British & Colonial Film Company in 1912, but with her first feature film in 1913 she worked with the Barker Film Company, where she would remain for most of her acting career. She may be best remembered for her role as Miss Western in Edwin J. Collins's Tom Jones starring Langhorn Burton and produced by the Ideal Film Company in 1917, and also for her last screen performance as Lady Barmouth in The Presumption of Stanley Hay, MP at the Stoll Film Company in 1925.

The sixth of seven siblings; Cora Harriet, Irene Selby, Hilda Elsie, Charles Edmund, Harold Edgar, and Richard Harbison, she was also a direct descendant of John Evelyn, the seventeenth-century diarist and horticulturist. Her father was stationmaster at Numurkah and reportedly much-liked, but tragically committed suicide due to insomnia in 1904, when she was seven years old.\n\n\n== Training ==\nRoach was living with her family at 'Sayes', Gordon Street Toorak when, from age sixteen, she studied at the Drawing School of the National Gallery of Victoria Art School from 1913 to 1916 under the guidance of Frederick McCubbin and William Beckwith McInnes. Later, she joined its School of Painting from the second term in 1916 to 1921, studying under  head of the Painting School, Lindsay Bernard Hall, and where she was first noted in a December 1917 review as a still life painter in an exhibition works of students\nIt was during this time that she became close to fellow student Madge Freeman. In addition, she received private lessons in watercolour painting from M. J. MacNally. In 1918, she was photographed for Punch at the Students' Fancy Dress Bal Masque dressed as a 'gypsy.'\n\n\n== England and Europe ==\nIn May 1923, Roach and Freeman organised their first joint exhibition of watercolours at the Fine Art Society's Galleries in Melbourne. In January 1924, having raised funds from their romantic Hilderesque watercolors and sold their painted and lacquered 'Madgelma' woodwork, they ventured to England, settling in the artists' hub of Chelsea. There, they briefly attended the Slade School under the tutelage of Henry Tonks. The two friends shared flats in London and Paris and embarked on painting journeys across France, Italy, Spain, and North Africa. In St Ives, Cornwall, they shared a studio with Gwen Horne.\n\n\n== Influences ==\nDuring their time in Paris, Roach and Freeman came into contact with Adolphe Milich (1884 - 1964), a French painter and teacher originally from Poland. Milich was associated with the School of Paris and specialised in oil and watercolour paintings, focusing on landscapes, still life, figure compositions, and portraits. His artistic approach, heavily influenced by Paul C\u00e9zanne, had a profound impact on Roach during the years she studied under him.\n\n\n== Australian exhibitions ==\nWhile in Europe, Roach would send her artwork back to Australia for exhibition with the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, The Independent Group, and various Melbourne commercial galleries. \n\nProfiled in a magazine article in February 1927 after her return from overseas only weeks before, she is described as: a Melbourne girl who has made herself a place in the artistic world with her craftsmanship in stained wood. Her ware is known by its beautiful glaze. Candlesticks, boxes and the like decorated with floral designs and shining like glass are among her fancies. Just a month or two ago she returned from a three years tour, chiefly on the Continent, and she has added to her repertoire designs in bas-relief and a fine French enamel finish. Though now known chiefly for her stained wood bric-a-brac, of which she is the originator here, she is also painter, and her watercolor sketches of scenes in Italy were hung at the last art show of the year at the Athen\u00e6um Gallery. While in France Elma had lessons at a famous arts and crafts school in Paris. She intends to hold an exhibition soon.Her first solo show was at the Fine Art Society in July 1927. In a new venture the Cheyne run by Rene Monteath Roach showed enamelled wood alongside etchings by John Shirlow, paintings by Dora Wilson, and pottery of Merric Boy\nDora Nkem Akunyili    (14 July 1954 \u2013 7 June 2014) was the Director-General of National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) of Nigeria from 2001 to 2008.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nDora Edemobi was born in Makurdi, Benue State, Nigeria to Chief Paul Young Edemobi who hailed from Nanka, Anambra State. She received her First School Leaving Certificate from St. Patrick's Primary School, Isuofia, Anambra State, in 1966 and had her West African School Certificate Examination (W.A.S.C) at Queen of the Rosary Secondary School Nsukka, Enugu State in 1973, where she graduated with Grade I Distinction consequently, she won the Eastern Nigerian Government Post Primary Scholarship and the Federal Government of Nigeria Undergraduate Scholarship. She went on to study Pharmacy at the University of Nigeria (U.N.N.), graduating in 1978 and received her Ph.D. in ethnopharmacology in 1985.\n\n\n== Career ==\nShe served on several State Government Boards and then was named Supervisory Councilor for Agriculture in a Local Government unit in Anambra State. She worked as a hospital pharmacist in the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital. (U.N.T.H), Enugu State.\nIn 1981, she became a Graduate Assistant in the FaU.NN. of Pharmaceutical Sciences, U.N.N. In 1990, she became a Senior Lecturer and in 1996, she was made a Consultant Pharmacologist at the College of Medicine.\nIn 1996, Akunyili became Zonal Secretary of the Petroleum Special Trust Fund (P.T.F), coordinating projects funded by profits from oil in Nigeria's South Eastern States. In 2001, President Olusegun Obasanjo appointed her the Director-General of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC).\n\n\n=== NAFDAC ===\nShe was appointed NAFDAC DG in 2001 and served till 2009.\nAkunyili had a special motivation for attacking the country's counterfeit drug problem  and this is because, in 1988, she had watched her sister aged 21, die after being given injections of fake insulin as part of regular diabetes treatment. She put together a team of mostly female pharmacists and inspectors and started a war against counterfeit drugs that saw many open-air medicine markets across the country closed down. Including one in Kano State after her officers confiscated \u00a3140,000 worth of fake drugs. The agency, under her leadership, broadcast jingles on radio and television to make the public aware of the dangers of substandard drugs and to encourage people to report suspicious drugs while also publishing lists of counterfeit products regularly in the newspapers.\nIn July 2003, the International Children's Heart Foundation visited Nigeria to operate on sick children at a teaching hospital in Enugu. After four children died in what appeared to be a case of counterfeit medical supplies, and despite being confronted with what seemed to be a hospital cover-up, Akunyili confiscated supplies and found fake adrenalin, fake muscle relaxant and infected intravenous drips.\nAs of June 2006, she was reported to have secured convictions for 45 counterfeiters with 56 cases pending. Her efforts led to increased public awareness about counterfeit drugs and more direct and purposeful surveillance at Nigerian customs.\n\n\n==== Assassination attempt ====\nOn 26 December 2003, while Akunyili was on the way to Anambra State in Eastern Nigeria, gunmen fired on her convoy. The bullets narrowly missed her, with one of the bullets going through her headscarf and through the windscreen of the car. Prior to the incident, she had faced constant death threats against herself, her family, and her staff. In 2014, at least six people were charged with conspiracy and attempted murder, but acquitted and discharged in 2014.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nIn 2008, Akunyili was appointed Minister of Information and Communications.\nShe resigned her appointment as Minister of Information and Communications on December 16, 2010, after two years of service to run for office as senator representing Anambra Central in\nRuth Sutherland (1884\u20131948), was an Australian painter and art critic. She was a founding member of the Twenty Melbourne Painters Society.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSutherland was born in Adelaide in 1884. She was granddaughter to notable sketcher George Sutherland, who emigrated to Australia from Scotland. She was a pupil of Gwen Barringer in South Australia before coming to Melbourne. She attended the National Gallery of Victoria Art School where she was taught by Lindsay Bernard Hall.\nSutherland wrote articles for the Melbourne newspaper 'The Age' and to the journal 'Art in Australia' about Max Meldrum and Hilda Rix Nicholas. \nSutherland was the niece of the painter Jane Sutherland and the sister of the composer Margaret Sutherland. She was also a cousin of Stella Bowen's.  She was a member of the Twenty Melbourne Painters. She had a joint exhibition of oils, watercolours and pastels with fellow artists Dora Wilson and May Roxburgh in 1918. Sutherland had a history with Dora Wilson prior to later established artist societies, exhibiting as part of \"The Waddy\" in 1909, along with Janet Cumbrae Stewart and Nora Gurdon. She enjoyed doing landscapes, renting a cottage in Lilydale with Bernice Edwell and Florence Rodway to sketch the surrounding country. She also exhibited with the Yarra Sculptors' Society. \nShe died in 1948. A memorial exhibition of her work referred to her as \"a quiet artist in a mode of painting now largely abandoned\" and that her works were most sympathetic.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n\tWatercolour paintings by Ruth Sutherland\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n1909, \"The Waddy\" society of artists, Guild Hall\n1909, Federal Art Exhibition, North terrace\n1911, Yarra Sculptors Society, Athenaeum Hall\n1912, \"The Waddy\" society (with Dora Taylor and Janet Cumbrae Stewart), Tuckett and Styles' Gallery\n1912, Group exhibition (with Dora Wilson and Nora Gurdon), Tuckett and Styles' Gallery\n1912 Victorian Artists Society autumn exhibition, Albert Street galleries\n1913, Group exhibition, Athenaeum Hall\n1914, Australian Art Association, Athenaeum Hall\n1914, British History Tableaux (in aid of Red Cross), Victorian Artists Society\n1914, Twelve Melbourne Painters Society second exhibition, Athenaeum Hall\n1915, Victorian Artists Society twentieth annual exhibition\n1916, Victorian Artists Society annual exhibition\n1916, French Week appeal exhibition, Town Hall\n1917, Australian Art Association fifth annual exhibition\n1918, Group exhibition (with Dora Wilson and May Roxburgh), Fine Art Society\n1919, French aid exhibition, Fine Art Galleries\n1919, Twenty Melbourne Painters Society, Athenaeum Gallery\n1919, Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors annual exhibition, Victoria Markets\n1920, Twenty Melbourne Painters Society, Athenaeum Hall\n1940, Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors annual exhibition, Athenaeum Gallery\n1941, Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors annual exhibition, Athenaeum Gallery\n1950, Memorial exhibition for Ruth Sutherland, Melbourne Book Club Gallery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nimages of Ruth Sutherland's paintings on MutualArt\nBiographical cuttings on Ruth Sutherland, National Library of Australia\nRuth Sutherland: Australian art and artists file, State Library Victoria\nAll the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are Men, But Some of Us Are Brave (1982) is a landmark feminist anthology in Black Women's Studies printed in numerous editions, co-edited by Akasha Gloria Hull, Patricia Bell-Scott, and Barbara Smith.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nHull received the National Institute's Women of Color Award for her contribution to this book. Her contribution to this \"landmark scholarship directed attention to the lives of Black women and, combined with the numerous articles she wrote thereafter, helped remedy the emphasis within Feminist Studies on white women and within Black studies on Black men\".\n\n\n== Context ==\n\nThe interest in black feminism was on the rise in the 1970s, through the writings of Mary Helen Washington, Audre Lorde, Alice Walker, and others.:\u200a87\u200a\nIn 1981, the anthology This Bridge Called My Back, edited by Cherr\u00ede Moraga and Gloria E. Anzald\u00faa, was published and But Some of Us Are Brave was published the following year. In both anthologies, the emphasis was placed on the intersection between race and gender. The contributors argued that previous waves of feminism had focused on issues related to white women. They wanted to negotiate a large space for women of color. According to Teresa de Lauretis, This Bridge Called My Back and But Some of Us Are Brave revealed \"the feelings, the analyses, and the political positions of feminists of color, and their critiques of white or mainstream feminism\" and created a \"shift in feminist consciousness.\":\u200a221\u200a\n\n\n== Impact ==\nIn the 2000 reprint of their anthology, editors Hull, Bell-Scott, and Smith described how in 1992 black feminists mobilized \"a remarkable national response\" - African American Women in Defense of Ourselves - to the controversy:\u200axvi\u200a surrounding the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court of the United States against the backdrop of allegations by law professor Anita Hill, about sexual harassment that became part of Thomas' confirmation hearings.\nLegal scholar Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw cited But Some of Us Are Brave at the beginning of her seminal 1989 paper, \"Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics\", in which she introduced the concept of Intersectionality. Crenshaw is known for introducing and developing intersectional theory to feminism. Crenshaw noted that it was one of the \"very few Black women's studies books\". She used the title All the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are Men, But Some of Us are Brave, as her \"point of departure\" to \"develop a Black feminist criticism\".:\u200a139\u200a\nBarbara Y. Welke published her article entitled \"When All the Women Were White, and All the Blacks Were Men: Gender, Class, Race, and the Road to Plessy, 1855\u20131914\", in reference to Hull et al., in 1995 in the Law and History Review. Welke wrote how Crenshaw, referring to But Some of Us Are Brave, said that the title \"sets forth a problematic consequence of the tendency to treat race and gender as mutually exclusive categories of experience and analysis.:\u200a139\u200a :\u200a139\u200a\n\n\n== Related readings ==\nThis Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color (1981), edited by Cherr\u00ede Moraga and Gloria E.

Her first name is often misspelled Nora in many articles reviewing her work.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nNorah Gurdon was born around Jan-March 1882 in Norfolk, England, to Dr. Edwin John Gurdon and Ellen Ann Randall. She was baptised on 11 April 1882. She was the second of four surviving children, and her family emigrated to Ballarat, Victoria in 1886, travelling on board ship the Carlisle Castle. They eventually settled in Brighton where her father had a doctor's surgery at their home. Gurdon showed early artistic talent while attending Brighton High School for Girls.\n\n\n== Career ==\nGurdon attended the National Gallery School from 1901 to 1908, being taught by noted artists Frederick McCubbin and Bernard Hall. While there she studied with fellow artists Jessie Traill, Dora Wilson, Constance Jenkins, and Janet Cumbrae Stewart, who were to become her lifelong friends. An accomplished landscape and still-life painter, Gurdon exhibited her works with the Victorian Artists Society while still a student. She established her artistic prowess early on by winning the major category for oil painting in the 1909 City of Prahran's Art Exhibition Prize. By the following year she had rented a studio in Collins Street along with friends Stewart and Traill. As well as being a prominent figure in the Melbourne Society of Painters and Sculptors, Gurdon went on to exhibit with fellow National Gallery School alumni in 1913 as part of Twelve Melbourne Painters. The group included Ruth Sutherland, Charles Wheeler, Dora Wilson, May Roxburgh, Percy Leason, Louis McCubbin, Penleigh Boyd, H. B. Harrison, and Frank Cozier.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nIntending to continue her artistic training overseas, in 1914 Gurdon travelled to England with her sister Winifred. Gurdon along with friend Jessie Traill was stuck in Europe due to the outbreak of war ten weeks after arriving. She signed up as a British Red Cross volunteer nurse in a French military hospital at Le Croisic, serving for three and a half years and was awarded a British Victory medal for her services. Much of her painting during this time was landscapes from travels to England and Scotland prior to war breaking out, and when armistice was reached in 1920 she stayed on to paint through Scotland, Suffolk, and Cornwall. This was hardly her only venture overseas however, as she returned in 1927, meeting fellow artists Pegg Clarke and Dora Wilson in Rome, and narrowly avoiding World War II on her 1938 travels to Norway and Sweden.\n\n\n=== Kalorama ===\nUnlike many other female artists of the time, Norah Gurdon was unmarried and financially independent. She purchased land in 1922 with plans to build her dream house in the Dandenong Ranges at Kalorama. When the house was finished she lived there with her sister Winifred and had many fellow artists as guests, with former students and teachers joining her for plen air landscape painting. While Gurdon painted in an impressionist style similar to her contemporaries, she favoured muted blue and grey tones to capture the hills of the Dandenongs. She also enjoyed handicrafts, spending her spare time at tapestry looms designing and producing her own floor rugs and mats.\n\n\tSelected photographs\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nGurdon was a regular and successful exhibitor of work, exhibiting with the Victorian Artists Society, Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, and the Australian Art Association.

Trained by Frederick McCubbin at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School, and by painter and printmaker Frank Brangwyn in London, Traill worked in England and France in the period immediately preceding World War I. During the war she served in hospitals with the Voluntary Aid Detachment.\nTraill is best known for a series of prints created in the early 1930s depicting the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Critic and art historian Sasha Grishin describes her as \"one of the great Australian artists of the 20th century\".\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nJessie Traill was born in Brighton, Victoria, on 29 July 1881. Her father was Scotland-born George Hamilton Traill, who had administered a vanilla plantation in the Seychelles, before becoming a bank manager in Victoria; her mother Jessie Neilley was Tasmanian.\nTraill was one of four daughters of George and Jessie, all of them educated at a boarding school in Switzerland, where they learned French and German. The family were deeply religious Anglicans; two of Traill's sisters would later join religious orders, while Margaret would become a carver.\nReturning to Australia, Traill in 1900 studied under John Mather (artist) at his Austral Art School.  In 1903 she kept a notebook of her lessons commenting on the etchings within it as they progress through various states. The notebook details her active engagement in the print making process and the tuition of John Mather. Together with jottings of sales, news clippings and a congratulatory letter from John Mather, her early success with the medium is documented. \nJessie Traill also studied at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School from 1902 to 1906, where she was taught by a leading member of the Heidelberg School, Frederick McCubbin. Her fellow students were mostly women and included Hilda Rix Nicholas, Norah Gurdon, Ruth Sutherland, Dora Wilson, and Vida Lahey. In March 1906, Traill and her sister Minna, together with her father, sailed for England, while her two older sisters, Kathleen and Elsie, remained in Victoria. George died while they were travelling in 1907, and is buried in Rome.\nTraill studied in London under Anglo-Welsh painter and printmaker Frank Brangwyn, as well as taking classes in summer with him, in Belgium and the Netherlands. She was the most accomplished student from Australia that he taught.\n\n\n== Early career, 1908 to 1931 ==\nTraill's first notable successes were in 1909, when works by the artist were hung at the Paris Salon and London's Royal Academy of Arts, while her first solo show was opened in Melbourne. She was successful again in 1914 with work hung at the Royal Academy.\nWhen war broke out in 1914 Traill, like fellow artist Iso Rae, joined the Voluntary Aid Detachment. She worked in hospitals, including at a convalescent facility in Roehampton in May 1915, then later in a military hospital in Rouen. Traill and Rae became the only Australian women artists to portray the war while in France. When in 1918 Australia first appointed official war artists, sixteen men were chosen; Traill was not included.\nBack in Australia, Traill in 1921 became a member of the Australian Painter-Etchers' Society, and entered its exhibitions. Her works from this period reflected her interest in both Art Nouveau and in the woodblock printing of Japan.\n\n\n== Sydney Harbour Bridge series ==\nWhen the Australian Painter-Etchers Society in 1932 held its only thematic exhibition, Sydney Harbour Bridge Celebrations, Traill contributed a series of seven prints. The works comprised six etchings completed across the period 1927 to 1931, and a coloured aquatint created after construction was finished in 1932. These have become Traill's best known and most highly regarded images. At the time they were created, the artist Arthur Streeton observed: Melbourne should be proud of that fine draughtswoman and etcher Miss Jessie Traill. By incessant labour \nAustralian women in World War I, were involved in militaries, and auxiliary organisations of the Allied forces abroad, and in administration, fundraising, campaigning, and other war time efforts on home front in Australia. They also played a role in the anti-war movement, protesting conscription, as well as food shortages driven by war activities. The role of women in Australian society was already shifting when the war broke out, yet their participation on all fronts during the Great War escalated these changes significantly.\nThe Australian Imperial Force (AIF) restricted women's enlistment to participation in the Australian Army Nursing Service (AANS), accepting only single women with professional nursing degrees, as well as a group of trained masseuses, 14 ward assistants and one bacteriologist. Initially the union of the AANS into the AIF was unclear and disorganized, with the nurses having no official rank. Tensions between the organisations resulted in principal matron Jane Bell of the AANS, and Lieutenant-Colonel William Ramsay Smith of the AIF to be recalled from duty. A subsequent enquiry into the feud resulted in the AANS receiving official recognition and officer rankings, with Evelyn Conyers leading the AANS as Matron-in-Chief for the duration of the war. Many nurses were decorated with military honours such as the Royal Red Cross, and seven nurses received the Military Medal for demonstrating bravery under fire.\nWomen doctors were told they would not be accepted into the Australian, or British militaries, and likewise there were no roles for women as cooks, orderlies, ambulance drivers, or any other role. However, many women who were determined to serve found their own way abroad, and participated through auxiliary organisations such as Red Cross organisations, and the Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service, or simply created their own opportunities by establishing hospital units, such as Rachel Ward's, Australian Voluntary Hospital, and Helen Sexton's H\u00f4pital Australien de Paris, or by establishing canteens for soldiers in Cairo as Alice Chisholm did. Some Australian women were also able to enlist the French and eventually the British militaries. The most senior Australian woman in military service during the war was Maud McCarthy, the British Expeditionary Force Matron-in-Chief for France and Flanders.\nAustralian women also played a significant role on the Australian home front. Led by Lady Helen Munro Ferguson, Australian women played a fundamental role in establishing the Australian branch of the British Red Cross, just a few days after the outbreak of the war. This organisation became the Australian Red Cross. Women undertook fundraising and recruiting activities as well as organising comfort packages for soldiers serving overseas. Other women also filled jobs made vacant by men joining the armed forces.\nAnti-war movements and campaigns were established by Australian women including the Women's Peace Army led by Vida Goldstein. Women were actively involved in campaigning on both sides of the debate on conscription, leading to events such as the Conscription disturbance at the Brisbane School of Arts which saw public conflict between the Women's Compulsory Service Petition League and the Brisbane branch of the Women's Peace army, led by Margaret Thorp. Anti-war protests led to some women, such as Adela Pankhurst being arrested for public disturbance.\nNevertheless, despite this involvement, women have never occupied a central position in the Australian version of the Anzac legend, although since the 1970s their role has been examined in more detail as a result of the emergence of feminist historiography, and specialist histories such as the history of nursing.\n\n\n== Australian societal context ==\nWith the British colonisation, Australian society became firmly patriarchal. Men held dominant positions in society, professional professions, and politics, as well as in families, having legal right of ownershi\nAllan Holder Jordan (1898\u20131982) was an Australian painter, designer, printmaker and teacher.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAllan Jordon was born in 1898 in Elsternwick, the son of Sandhurst-born customs agent James Oliver Jordan and Maud Ethel (n\u00e9e Alleyne) who married in 1897.\nLiving in Malvern, Jordan's interest at age sixteen was in amateur photography, on the subject of which he contributed three articles, with concise diagrams, to The Australasian Photo-Review, one in the 15 January 1916 edition about making \"Photographic Bookplates,\" another on building a home darkroom in a bathroom, and one instructing how to use a camera as a solar enlarger. His photographs featured in the magazine, and he was also awarded prizes in the A P-R competitions.\n\n\n== Career ==\nJordan studied at Swinburne Technical College from 1915\u20131919.\n\n\n=== Printmaker ===\n\nHe worked mainly in woodcuts and wood engraving and was an influential teacher in printmaking and book arts in Australia. His oeuvre numbers sixty graphic prints, twenty designed and illustrated small books and seventy-one bookplates, as well as drawings, paintings, pastels and small mosaics, a body of work noted by Robert Littlewood \"for its consistent quality of design and draftsmanship combined with the expert manner in which the works have been created.\"\nLittlewood identifies  \"three notable areas of interest in Jordan's creative effort: linocuts and colour woodcuts in the 1930s; book design and illustration in the 1940s; and bookplate design for two decades from 1939 until 1958.\" Jordan exhibited in group shows through the 1930s, and less frequenlty in subsequent years.\n\n\n=== Coin design ===\nAfter complaints to the Federal Treasurer that some of Australia's coin designs were heraldically incorrect, action was taken in September 1946, when Prime Minister Chifley, while at Renmmark, was presented with a suggested lyrebird design by Jordan to replace the coat of arms displayed on the sixpence that was claimed to be obsolete. Chifley promised to consider the Jordan's design made in collaboration with Sydney V. Hagley of the Numismatic Society. Ultimately the design of the coin was unchanged.\n\n\n=== Illustrator ===\nAmongst his work are five wood engravings for Joseph O'Dwyer's The Turning Year 1944. Other designs he created for Hawthorn Press, Melbourne in the 1940s included a series of paperback booklets printed on lesser-quality wartime paper and sold at 1 shilling and sixpence, which were written by Frank Clune, each dealing with some aspect of Australian history, such as his 1944 Stories of Central Australia.\n\n\n=== Bookplates ===\nJordan joined artists Neville Barnett, Roy Davies, Adrian Feint, Lionel Lindsay and Philip Litchfield in a revival of the bookplate before World War Two. His Ex Libris bookplates often employ intricate rebuses to characterise their owners, and such is the case with that he created for World War Two hero Russell Francis Wright MBE (1920-2012).\nJordan\u2019s prints and paintings are in national and international collections.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nJordan's work in a 1931 group show was praised in The Age as \"the most unique of the four contributors,\"for his fifteen color and black prints from wood blocks\" and picked out for \"an outstanding print in black, Treasure Ship, admirably drawn and full of movement.\" The Bulletin reviewing the same show reports that \"Allan Jordan has been trying to capture some of the subtlety of Melbourne's winter atmosphere per the very difficult medium of the woodblock, and in The Changing Skyline, Exhibition Building and Winter Sunshine, Fitzroy Garden, has succeeded in nabbing some of the bolder contrasts.\" Artist and critic Harold Herbert also prasied his work in that show, writing that \"Mr. Jordan is an accomplished designer and an efficient craftsman.\"\nOf a joint exhibition he held in Melbourne in 1932 with Dorothy Lungley, the Age reviewed his linocuts, etchings and drypoints, describing the colour prints as \"uniformly good in execution and concep\nJanie Wilkinson Whyte (1869\u20131953) was an Australian artist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nWhyte was a painter, etcher, and wood-carver who studied at the National Gallery School from 1890\u20131895 and together with Dora Wilson and Jessie Traill took lessons in etching from John Mather. Their etchings were published in The Lone Hand in 1907 as some of the earliest works in this field made by women. Whyte was an impressionist artist who painted portraits, figure studies, and landscapes, and was one of the first Melbourne women to paint dockyard scenes. She also painted interiors and flowers, and worked with oils, watercolours, and pastels. Her cityscapes contained charming observations of Melbourne life. Whyte showed with the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors in the 1920s.\nAs part of a first wave of feminist artists in Melbourne, Whyte presented a paper at women's cultural group the Austral Salon along with Violet Teague in August 1907. While a copy of her lecture was not archived it is said she discussed the struggle for Australian women artists to get recognition.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJanie Wilkinson Whyte Australian art and artists file, State Library Victoria\nJanie Wilkinson Whyte : work old and new (Athenaeum, Sept 17\u201328, 1935) digitised item, State Library Victoria\nThe Australian Academy of Art was a conservative Australian government-authorised art organisation which operated for ten years between 1937 and 1946 and staged annual exhibitions. Its demise resulted from opposition by Modernist artists, especially those associated with the Contemporary Art Society, though the influence of the Academy continued into the 1960s.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Precedents ===\nEfforts to form an art academy in Australia were initially limited to individual States: The Academy of Arts, Australia, under the presidentship of P. Fletcher Watson was founded in Sydney in 1891, with its first exhibition held in 1892, but survived only four years. The Society of Artists, founded in Sydney in 1897, and the Australian Artists\u2019 Association, of Melbourne, both had members from various States, but held their regular exhibitions only in their home states.\n\n\n=== Formation ===\nAspiring to the principles of the long-established, but independent, privately funded, and also by then conservative, British Royal Academy of Arts (founded in 1768), Attorney-General Robert Menzies envisaged an overarching, Federal organisation promoting art that would be \"understood by\" the ordinary Australian amongst the middle class who were his prime supporters in his later prime-ministerships.\n\nIn The Argus of 3 May 1937 in an article headed \"Does Not Like the \"cross-eyed drawing\" of Modern Art,\" he was reported to take issue with the idea that this might be de facto censorship of \"those whose conception of art is not his,\" as had been suggested by Mr. Norman Macgeorge in a letter published the previous Saturday. MacGeorge, Menzies responded, was \"misinformed about the object of the proposed Australian Academy;\" It is true, however, as Mr. Macgeorge claims, that I find nothing but absurdity in much so-called modern art, with its evasion of real problems and its cross-eyed drawing. It is equally true that I think that in art beauty is the condition of immortality - a conclusion strengthened by an examination of the works of the great European masters and that the language of beauty ought to be capable of being understood by reasonably cultivated people who are not themselves artists. I realise that an academy should find room in its membership for all schools of artistic thought provided they are based on competent craftsmanship. So much do I realise this truth, which I take to be the basis of Mr. Macgeorge's letter, that at the outset, when mentioning the academy idea to a committee of artists, I stipulated that I would take no steps to further it unless this principle were adhered to. The published list of those invited to join the proposed academy is the best proof that the principle has been followed. The list was selected by artists of the highest standing. My only function has been, and is, as an uninstructed lover of fine painting and drawing, to do as much as I can to help obtain for Australia the benefits of an artistic organisation which has been invaluable in England.\"\nSubsequently, at a meeting of ten state delegates in the smokeroom of the Canberra Hotel, Menzies formed the Australian Academy of Art, on 19 June 1937 and was its inaugural chair.  Where long-established European art academies were teaching institutions, the Australian Academy was not, and served to present annual salons by invitation to established artists.  Its other role was to advise government on art administration as \"a body which will be recognised as a standard reference on art.\" It was to be the second such academy in the British dominions, following Canada's which was established in 1880 with a Royal charter, which was sought also by Australia's.\n\nThe Academy was to continue in an anti-Modernist stance, with one member, Norman St Clair Carter, describing 'contemporary art' as a 'fungoid growth.' While tolerating some Australian post-impressionism, its exhibitions showed traditional figurative and realist paintings by Hans Heysen, William Dargie, John Longsta\nEileen Alberta Boyd became Mrs Gordon Lane (13 December 1890 \u2013 14 September 1975) was an Australian singer. She began as a child performer and she toured in the UK during World War One.\n\n\n== Life ==\nBoyd was born in 1890 in Sydney to Margaret (born Shalvey) and Albert Boyd. Both her parents had been born in Australia and her father ran a hotel. Her parents arranged lessons for her in singing and elocution and she was a child singer. She toured New Zealand in 1900 when she was known as the \"The Baby Baritone, Clog Dancer and Whistler\". She continued her education with a tutor while on tour. In 1910 a concert was arranged in Sydney to mark her transition from a child performer to a singer with a fine contralto voice. In 1915 she married in Britain in May and in October she was a widow with a child and a young teenage step-daughter. Her husband, Hugh Ernest Roberts had been a master mariner.\nIn 1917 she sang at the Royal Albert Hall in London and many prestigious venues when she joined a tour in support of the Red Cross starring and organised by Clara Butt and Kennerley Rumford. She and Butt were \"favourably compared\" and they sang  The Dream of Gerontius being George V and Queen Mary in 1917. By 1925, she had two children although she still found time to sing as Mrs Gordan Lane.\nIn 1934 she was still using the name \"Eileen Boyd\" when recording. In 1937 it was \"Mrs Gordon Lane\" who commissioned a pastel portrait from the Australian artist Dora Wilson. It was called \"Nada\" and it was exhibited at Margaret MacLean's Gallery in Melbourne.\nBoyd died in 1975 in Hammondville.\n\n\n== Recordings include ==\n\nYour King and Country Want You, Jumbo, c. 1915\nThe Stranger of Galilee,1934\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography at ADB\nThe Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, established in Melbourne, Victoria in 1902, is the oldest surviving women's art group in Australia.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors (MSWPS) began in 1902 as a monthly gathering of eight former students of Frederick McCubbin from the National Gallery School which members called the Students' Art Club. It is known that among these founders were Daisy Stone, Tina Gowdie, Annie Gates, Kate Allan, Ella Thorn, Henrietta Maria Gulliver and a Miss Stock (otherwise unidentified, who died in 1906). In 1905 they added the indigenous word  \"Woomballano\" (meaning either 'everlasting beauty' or 'search for beauty') to identify their Art Club, changing its title to The Women's Art Club in 1913 then to the Melbourne Society of Women Painters in 1930. The present designation was adopted in 1954.\nMany of its early members were plein air painters and identified with the Heidelberg School, which was regarded widely as a male group but which involved many women. The interest in the decorative arts at the opening of the twentieth century attracted other members who were significant craftspeople. By the 1920s, the Society was assimilating the generation of professional women artists emerging from the Melbourne National Gallery School, with significant women artists, representatives of both the Meldrum tonal school and modernism, being invited to join. The Society was less overtly feminist than its Sydney counterpart The  Society of Women Painters (later named Women\u2019s Industrial Arts Society) which was founded in 1910 in reaction to the discrimination of male-dominated juries of art institutions and societies.  During the Second World War the MSWPS opened volunteer headquarters at Grosvenor Chambers (9 Collins Street, Melbourne) where they made and sold handcrafts and art to raise money for the war effort.\nMSWPS has met at heritage-listed Ola Cohn House 41-43 Gipps Street, East Melbourne since the sculptor's death in 1964.

Green, and starring George Brent, Bette Davis, and Ann Dvorak. The screenplay by Manuel Seff and Lillie Hayward is based on a story by Hayward and Robert Lord.\nA print is held at the Library of Congress.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nNan Reynolds (Ann Dvorak) struggles to run the household on her meek husband Bill's (George Brent) meager salary as an office manager. She urges him to apply for better jobs elsewhere, but he is disinclined to take risks, and his lack of ambition is placing a strain on their marriage.\nPat Berkeley (Bette Davis), who attended high school with Nan and Bill, is hired by his firm as an advertising copywriter, and her success prompts Nan to coerce her husband into asserting himself with his boss. When he fails to spark any interest with his ideas, Bill succumbs to his wife's suggestion that he start his own agency using the money she has managed to save. Spurred by Nan, he steals a major client from his former firm and hires Pat to help him handle it. Complications arise when the feelings the two had for each other years before are reignited and they embark upon an affair. Nan becomes aware of their relationship but chooses to ignore it.\nBill announces he wants a divorce. When Nan refuses to grant him one, he angrily leaves the house and accidentally hits their son Buddy (Ronnie Cosby) with the car, seriously injuring him. Months pass, Buddy recovers, and Bill and Nan's divorce is in its final stages. Hearing Nan's court testimony, Bill realizes how good she is as a wife and mother and how much he loves and needs her, and the two decide to reconcile.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nGeorge Brent as William Reynolds\nBette Davis as Patricia Berkeley\nAnn Dvorak as Nan Reynolds\nJohn Halliday as Paul Duprey\nRuth Donnelly as Dora Wilson\nHobart Cavanaugh as George Wilson\nRobert Barrat as Sam Blake\nJoseph Cawthorn as Krueger (as Joe Cawthorne)\nPhil Regan as Radio Singer\nWillard Robertson as Judge\nRonnie Cosby as Buddy Reynolds\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nFrank S. Nugent of The New York Times observed, \"A characteristic of a poor boxer is that he telegraphs his punches. In Housewife . . . the dramatic punches are not merely telegraphed, but radioed. About the most unexpected element of the film is the bewildering regularity with which the unexpected fails to happen . . . Mr. Brent and Miss Dvorak do as well as any one might expect, but Miss Davis is a trifle too obvious as the siren.\"\nAlthough Variety called it \"satisfactory entertainment,\" when asked about the film in later years, Bette Davis responded, \"Dear God! What a horror!\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nHousewife at IMDb\nHousewife at the TCM Movie Database\nHousewife at AllMovie\nHousewife at the AFI Catalog of Feature Films\nHalf a Soul is a Regency fantasy romance novel written by Olivia Atwater. It is the first installment in her Regency Faerie Tales trilogy. The novel follows Theodora \"Dora\" Ettings, a girl unable to feel and express her emotions since the faerie Lord Hollowvale stole half of her soul. After moving to London, Dora meets the royal magician Elias Wilder, who promises to help her find a cure. However, he is busy investigating a mysterious sleeping plague that is spreading among children in the workhouses. Dora joins the investigation, which will lead her to confront Lord Hollowvale once again.\nAtwater published Half a Soul on her own in 2020, before it was acquired by Orbit Books and re-released in 2022. Reviewers appreciated its cozy atmosphere that contrasts with the portrayal of the darker side of London during the period.\n\n\n== Development and publication ==\nOlivia Atwater submitted her first novel to a publishing company at the age of twelve, but later decided to pursue different careers and continue writing in her spare time. The first idea for Half a Soul came from a singular scene where the protagonist washes her gown in a fountain during a ball. Atwater said: \"I just had the idea that she was a Regency lady who felt and acted as though she were in a dream, and I knew it was going to be difficult for her because that sort of thing would not do well in an era of strict manners.\" While researching the Regency period, she decided to also portray the struggles of the lower social classes, introducing a more serious element to the story.\nAfter researching self-publishing, Atwater followed a friend's advice and published Half a Soul on her own in 2020. It was the first installment in her Regency Faerie Tales trilogy, later followed by Ten Thousand Stitches and Longshadow. Orbit Books acquired the English rights for all three novels in 2022 from Christable McKinley at David Higham Associates. The ebook editions were released in April 2022, while the new paperback edition of Half a Soul was published in June 2022. Matthew Burne illustrated the new covers for all the novels. German and French rights were sold to CBJ and Albin Michel, respectively.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring the Regency era, Theodora \"Dora\" Eloisa Charity Ettings lives with her aunt and uncle, Lady and Lord Lockheed, and their daughter Vanessa in the English countryside after her parents' death. Dora wanders into the woods and encounters the faerie Lord Hollowvale, who claims Dora's mother sold her to him and tries to steal her soul. However, Vanessa stabs him with a pair of iron scissors and the faerie escapes with only half of Dora's soul. Dora has now heterochromatic eyes and is unable to feel and express most of her emotions. Her aunt says she is cursed and urges them to keep the secret to avoid bringing shame on their family. Fearing the faerie might come back, Vanessa gives the scissors to Dora for protection.\nYears later, her aunt is trying to find a husband for Vanessa, who suggests moving their search to London. They stay at Lady Hayworth's house and both ladies exclude Dora from preparations for future balls. While exploring London, Dora ends up in a magic shop where she sees a glimpse of the future in a mirror: she is wearing a gown stained with what seems to be blood. She also meets the royal magician, Elias Wilder, and Lady Carroway's third son, physician Albert Lowe, who invites her to a ball. Dora's aunt and Lady Hayworth suggest she seduce Albert, while Vanessa will charm his eldest brother, Edward, set to inherit the title of viscount. At the ball, her vision becomes true, but the blood ends up being just spilled punch. Vanessa reveals Dora's secret to the royal magician, hoping he might find a cure. Elias promises to help, but he is also preoccupied with a sleeping plague that is afflicting children in the workhouses.\nTo elude the ladies' strict control, Elias fakes interest in Dora and gives her an enchanted mirror, which allows her to contact him.

She was a founding member of the Australian Tonalist movement and part of the Twenty Melbourne Painters Society.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDescribed in a 2009 review by Sasha Grishin as \u201ca South Australian Meldrumite who has been almost totally forgotten,\u201d Mary 'Polly' Hurry in fact was born in Kyneton, Victoria, on 2 May, 1883, daughter of Henry Hurry and Mary Herring and the middle child of two siblings, Maurice and George. She spent her early years there at the family home South Lodge, 29 Donnithorne Street, then was educated at Ruyton Girls' School, Kew.\n\n\n== Training ==\nLater, at the Kyneton School of Mines, Hurry took lessons in drawing and wood carving, then studied watercolour painting with the Scottish-born artist, John Mather. During a camping holiday she met several artists, who like Mather were associates of the tonalist Max Meldrum, and decided to take up art seriously. She began drawing from life at Melbourne's 1859 Old Temple Court building where studios were occupied by students of Frederick McCubbin; Jessie Traill, Dora Wilson, Janet Cumbrae Stewart, Norah Gurdon and AME Bale; before approaching Meldrum to join his studio as one of the first of his pupils, alongside Harry McClelland.\n\n\n== Australian tonalist artist ==\nHurry regarded Meldrum as the most important influence on her artistic development, but the association also shaped her personal life; in Meldrum\u2019s studio she met John Farmer whom she married on 13 August 1921. Farmer (1897-1989) was a close friend of fellow student 10 years younger, Justus Jorgensen, when both attended the National Gallery School in 1914, where he also met Clarice Beckett and Colin Colahan. Brought up in a large family in Brunswick, Farmer worked as a scenery painter for J.C. Williamson Ltd. Richard McCullin, a drawing master at the Gallery School, suggested that students might be interested in going to hear a lecture in 1917 by controversial young painter, Max Meldrum, who argued that \"the art of painting is a pure science - the science of optical analysis.\"\n\nHurry became a founding member of the original Twenty Melbourne Painters Society \u2014 Jas Stuart Anderson, Alice Bale, Elsie Barlow, Alexander Colquhoun, George Colville, Edith Downing, Bernice Edwell, William Frater, Henrietta Maria Gulliver, Carl Hampel, C.E. James, Richard McCann, Bertha Merfield, A.E. Newbury, Clara Southern, Ruth Sutherland, Jo Sweatman,  Isobel Tweddle, and Rose A. Walker  \u2014 all supporters and students of Meldrum, which split from The Victorian Artists Society in protest at his defeat in the 1918 election for its president. In 1919, the breakaway group held their first exhibition. Twenty Melbourne Painters Society founding Secretary A.M.E. Bale declared:\u201cWe desire nothing but sincerity and a humble study of nature, from which alone all art, whether decorative or realistic, draws any enduring life.\u201d\nAlso in 1921, Hurry entered the inaugural Archibald Prize, in which 41 works were submitted and all exhibited from 17 January 1922 for two months. The Prize was awarded to WB McInnes, but no catalogue for the 1921 exhibition has been found, and the subject of the work submitted by Hurry is not known. \nThe couple shared one of the purpose-built studios (Studio 2) at the 1888 Grosvenor Chambers, 9 Collins Street, Melbourne (its name a direct reference to Grosvenor Gallery of London) occupied also at various times by Meldrum, Tom Roberts, Frederick McCubbin, Arthur Streeton, Percival Ball, Charles Francis Summers, Clara Southern, Jane Sutherland, Charles Conder, E. Phillips Fox, John Longstaff, Girolamo Nerli, Louis Abrahams, Rose Walker, George Lambert, and Ola Cohn. Frequent visitors to the studio were Janet Cumbrae Stewart, Norah Gurdon, Dora L. Wilson (who also had a studio in the building), Jessie Traill, Norah Wilkie and Margaret Pestell.\n\n\n== Asia ==\nFor their honeymoon the Farmers left via Hong Kong for China, visiting Sha\nThe Dora Mavor Moore Awards (also known as the Dora Awards or the Doras) are awards presented annually by the Toronto Alliance for the Performing Arts (TAPA), honouring theatre, dance and opera productions in Toronto.
