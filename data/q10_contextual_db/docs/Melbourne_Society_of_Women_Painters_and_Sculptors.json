{"page_content": "The Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, established in Melbourne, Victoria in 1902, is the oldest surviving women's art group in Australia.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors (MSWPS) began in 1902 as a monthly gathering of eight former students of Frederick McCubbin from the National Gallery School which members called the Students' Art Club. It is known that among these founders were Daisy Stone, Tina Gowdie, Annie Gates, Kate Allan, Ella Thorn, Henrietta Maria Gulliver and a Miss Stock (otherwise unidentified, who died in 1906). In 1905 they added the indigenous word  \"Woomballano\" (meaning either 'everlasting beauty' or 'search for beauty') to identify their Art Club, changing its title to The Women's Art Club in 1913 then to the Melbourne Society of Women Painters in 1930. The present designation was adopted in 1954.\nMany of its early members were plein air painters and identified with the Heidelberg School, which was regarded widely as a male group but which involved many women. The interest in the decorative arts at the opening of the twentieth century attracted other members who were significant craftspeople. By the 1920s, the Society was assimilating the generation of professional women artists emerging from the Melbourne National Gallery School, with significant women artists, representatives of both the Meldrum tonal school and modernism, being invited to join. The Society was less overtly feminist than its Sydney counterpart The  Society of Women Painters (later named Women\u2019s Industrial Arts Society) which was founded in 1910 in reaction to the discrimination of male-dominated juries of art institutions and societies.  During the Second World War the MSWPS opened volunteer headquarters at Grosvenor Chambers (9 Collins Street, Melbourne) where they made and sold handcrafts and art to raise money for the war effort.\nMSWPS has met at heritage-listed Ola Cohn House 41-43 Gipps Street, East Melbourne since the sculptor's death in 1964. She was President of the Society from 1948 to 1964.\n\n\n== Notable members ==\nMelbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors members included:\n\nCristina Asquith Baker, painter, print-maker (1868\u20131960)\nAlice Marian Ellen Bale (1875\u20131955), Studied at National Gallery School 1895\u20131904, from 1917 to 1955 a consistent exhibitor with the Women\u2019s Art Club \nMargaret Francis Ellen Baskerville sculptor (1861\u20131930)\nClarice Beckett (1887\u20131935) participated in Women\u2019s Art Club shows until the early 1930s.\nLina Bryans (1909\u20132000), exhibited 1940\u20131965 and prominent in the 1960s, resigned 1966, rejoined 1991\u2014.

It was formed in March 1888 when the Victorian Academy of Arts (previously Victorian Society of Fine Arts) and the Australian Artists' Association amalgamated.\nThe Victorian Artists\u2019 Society is a not-for-profit organisation and charity registered with the Victorian government. The Artists' Society routinely practices a range of art forms and styles through classes and gatherings in their permanent home, a heritage-listed bluestone building on Albert Street, Melbourne, opposite St. Patrick's Cathedral. As of 2021, the Victorian Artists' Society premises include four galleries, members\u2019 rooms, an administrative office, and the original bluestone studio which operates as an art school. The original studio was not finished until 1902.\nThe general public can view the seasonal collections of artworks in the gallery or buy artworks. The gallery is open seven days a week and the cost is free entry. New exhibitions are held fortnightly within the five galleries.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Victorian Society of Fine Arts, a forerunner to the Victorian Academy of Arts, was established in 1856. The Victorian Academy of Arts was formed in 1870 with \"about twenty artists and amateurs\" amongst its first members, including Eliezer Levi Montefiore.\nThe Australian Artists' Association held its first exhibition in 1886, with works by Tom Roberts, Louis Buvelot, Frederick McCubbin, and Arthur Streeton.\nIn March 1888 the academy and the Association amalgamated, creating the Victorian Artists Society. The founding president of the new Society was Joseph Anderson Panton; later presidents included Frederick McCubbin and Paul Raphael Montford.\nThe premises at 430 Albert Street in East Melbourne were erected for the society in 1888, enlarged in 1892 and modernised in 1953. Facilities include four galleries, teaching studio, members room, offices and other ancillary facilities.\n\nDuring its early establishment, the Artists\u2019 Society met in a private house in St. Kilda. Its founding members included landscape painter Louis Buvelot, painter Hubert de Castella and etcher J.A. Panton. The Artists\u2019 Society was known for throwing parties and picnics at Brighton. By the 1890s, there were 400 members.\nThis historical building was not limited to fine arts and was also established as a music conservatory that offered singing lessons by Nellie Melba. Melba taught music lessons at the historical building from 1915 until close to her death in 1931. She would perform to crowds outside from the balcony of the house. In 2014, the Society honoured Melba with a special plaque for the gallery to record her musical history at the Victorian Artists\u2019 Society.\n\nThe Artists\u2019 Society was a starting point for young artists of the Heidelberg school, a Victorian impressionist art movement of the 19th century, to exhibit their work and make their first major sales. Artists of the Heidelberg school who were active members of the Victorian Artists\u2019 Society included Charles Conder, Frederick McCubbin, Arthur Streeton, and Tom Roberts.\nMax Meldrum, the Victorian Artists\u2019 Society president in 1917, taught tonal realism at the gallery studio. In 1918 he left the Victorian Artists\u2019 Society to form \u2018The Society of Twenty Melbourne Painters\u2019. Meldrum ran this society in its early stages from his studio in Hardware Chambers, Elizabeth Street, Melbourne. They later changed their name to Twenty Melbourne Painters Society.\nMost of the early exhibitors in the Society were women.\nAlbert Tucker, an Australian artist, and member of the Heide Circle, went to night art classes at the Victorian Artists\u2019 Society studio in the 1930s.\nIn 1938, at a VAS meeting, artists interested in contemporary styles decided to form Contemporary Artists\u2019 Society (CAS). CAS is still active.\n\n\n== Today ==\nAs of 2021\nThe Victorian Artists Society is a gallery and p\nThe Society of Women Painters was a major art group in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia in the early 20th century with a significant history across three decades. Significant women creatives of the period such as Eirene Mort, Florence Taylor, Florence Rodway, Ethel Stephens, Maude Sherwood, Frank Payne, Bernice Edwell, Hulda Marshall and Gladys Owen had long connections to the Society of Women Painters and unlike later art historians, contemporary sources document most members as being well trained active professionals with noticeable public profiles, rather than suburban hobbyists.\n\n\n== Establishment ==\nThe establishment of the Society of Women Painters was the culmination of nearly two decades of advocacy and activism for women artists, frequently centred around Ethel Anna Stephens, who was elected to the committee of the Royal Art Society in 1892 to represent the interests of the many female exhibitors. Women made up at least a quarter of the members but had little say in the governance of the organisation. Women artists had been among the large group of artists discontent with selection policies in the two major art groups towards the end of the first decade of the twentieth century.  \n\"During the past three years the pressure of exhibitors claiming space at the Royal Art Society's annual show has led to a good deal of discontent and in 1908 two or three groups of women painters held exhibitions of their own with a large measure of success.\"  \nThe bickering around and between various art groups led to representatives of the Society of Artists making deputations to politicians and demanding that the government pressure the Royal Art Society to share their premises with other groups or otherwise the government should build a new exhibition gallery for other Sydney groups. The Society of Artists' \"interests were also identical with those of the Society of Women Painters, the Institute of Architects, the Photographic Society, Arts and Crafts, and other kindred societies.\" No promise to do so was given.\nThe inaugural meeting to launch the society was held in Edith Cusack's studio in July 1909, and at a second meeting in August 1909 thirty members joined the society and a provisional committee selected pending formal election of officer bearers. Miniaturist, Bernice Edwell was a founding Council member. Emily Meston and Lilian Chauvel were the contacts for membership. The press noted that the group \"really grew into being through the discontent of certain exhibitors in having a percentage of their work excluded from the Royal Art Society's and the Society' of Artists' exhibitions.\" In some ways the Society of Women Painters had a more overtly feminist origin than the much longer lived Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors. Yet from the very start, the Society of Women Painters also identified itself with the most prominent sectors of Sydney society, inviting Lady Chelmsford the Governor's wife, who enjoyed painting, both to show work and be the President of the society. She also opened the first exhibition. In 1928 Lady Fuller, seated on a throne in a bower of greenery, was crowned Queen by Ethel Stephens, in front of 200 guests at the Society of Women Painters' fundraising pageant. This alignment to socially prominent personalities was not untypical of other art and applied art groups in early and mid 20th century Sydney, such as the Arts and Crafts Society and the Embroiderers' Guild.\n\n\n== Reviews ==\nThe Society of Women Painters regularly received poor notices from Sydney critics.  \"From the point of view of the art critic there is little of significance to be noted. The contemporary movements find no echo in this sheltered haven. A feminine flair for prettiness, for apt flower arrangement for agreeable but never bold colour reigns. However the same critic also noted that the black and white section was more radical and \"distinctive\" in outlook than the oils and praised the work of printmakers, including Ethel S\nHenrietta Maria Gulliver (29 October 1866 \u2013 15 July 1945) was an Australian artist who specialized in landscape and floral still-life paintings. She was also a florist, horticulturalist and landscape designer.\n\n\n== Life and family ==\nHenrietta grew up in Sale, in Eastern Victoria.  She was the fifth of eight children born to pharmacist Robert Shanklin and Maria Barbara n\u00e9e Ronalds, who was a professional fly tier and daughter of renowned fly fisherman Alfred Ronalds. Henrietta married George Ekins Gulliver in 1900 and had two daughters. Gulliver was a successful and wealthy pharmacist who developed and manufactured the famous Australian drug \"Laxettes\". They spent the majority of their married life in the Melbourne area although they also lived for several years in Capel, Surrey in England. Sam Griffiths is one of their great-grandsons.\n\n\n== Gardener and florist ==\nHenrietta had moved to Melbourne around 1885 to work for her uncle Nathaniel Ronalds, who was a leading nurseryman and florist. She then opened her own florist business in the city centre which quickly gained a strong reputation. After her marriage she was able to design and create substantial garden estates in Cheltenham and Sassafras, both of which were widely admired.\n\n\n== Painter ==\nHenrietta studied at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in the period 1892-99. Tom Roberts encouraged her interest in painting, and she also interacted with the landscape painter Arthur Streeton, who influenced her style and remained a lifelong friend. She was invited to exhibit at Frederick McCubbin\u2019s studio in 1905. She was a founding member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors and served in two different periods as president. She was an original member of the Twenty Melbourne Painters Society in 1918, and was also active in the Victorian Artists Society, including on its council. Henrietta mounted a solo exhibition in 1925.\nHer gardens and their flowers were the inspiration for many of her paintings. Other artists who also sketched and painted at her properties included Clara Southern, Hilda Rix Nicholas, Elsie Barlow and Alice Marian Ellen Bale.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n\tOil paintings by Henrietta Maria Gulliver\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nVictorian Artists' Society Spring exhibition, Galleries East Melbourne (1917)\nMelbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors annual exhibition, Queen Victoria Markets (1919)\nTwenty Melbourne Painters, Athenaeum Gallery (15 - 29 September 1925)\nDecoration Gallery, 289 Collins Street (November 24 - December 5, 1925)\nMelbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors 28th annual exhibition, Athenaeum Gallery (1937)\nFlower studies, Stair Gallery, 131 Collins Street (November 29 - December 11, 1937)\nMelbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors 29th annual exhibition, Athenaeum Gallery (1938)\nMelbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors annual exhibition, Athenaeum Gallery (1941)\nVictorian Artists' Society Spring exhibition (September 29 - October 11, 1942)\nMelbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors 36th annual exhibition, Athenaeum Gallery (9 - 20 October 1945)\n\n\n== Collections ==\nCastlemaine Art Museum\n\n\n== References ==\nThis is a list of women's organization by civics\n\n\n== International ==\n\nAll India Democratic Women's Association - founded in 1981 to achieve women's emancipation in India\nAlliance of Pan American Round Tables \u2013 founded 1916 to foster women's relationships throughout the Americas\nArab Feminist Union \u2013 founded 1945\nAssociated Country Women of the World \u2013 international organization formed in 1933\nThe Association of Junior League International \u2013 Women's development organization founded in 1901\nBeta Sigma Phi \u2013 founded 1931\nCommunist Women's International (1920\u20131930) \u2013 established to advance communist ideas among women\nCouncil of Women World Leaders \u2013 Membership of nearly all the world's current and former women presidents and prime ministers\nEllevate Network \u2013 Global professional network dedicated to closing the gender achievement gap (founded 1997)\nEquality Now \u2013 founded in 1992 to ensure gender equality and an end to violence against women\nEvery Woman Foundation \u2013 celebrating International Women's Day\nGather the Women Global Matrix \u2014 A global grassroots network of women activating the Divine Feminine in Leadership (founded 2003)\nGraduate Women International \u2013 Organized to promote women's education (founded 1919)\nInner Wheel Club \u2013 founded 1924 for the wives and daughters of Rotarians\nInternational Alliance of Women \u2013 founded in 1904 to advocate suffrage\nInternational Alliance for Women \u2013 founded 1980 for professional women\nInternational Association of Women Police \u2013 (established 1915) network for women in law enforcement and criminal justice\nInternational Council of Women \u2013 founded in the year 1888, first international women's organization\nInternational Federation for Research in Women's History \u2013 founded 1987, organizes international conferences\nInternational Federation of Business and Professional Women \u2013 founded 1930, network for professional women\nInternational Federation of Women Lawyers \u2013 founded 1944, enhances the status of women and children by providing legal aid, legal literacy and education programs, and through advocacy, law reform, research and publications\nInternational Women's Forum \u2013 founded 1974\nInternational Women's Health Coalition \u2013 founded 1984, based in New York to advocate for issues pertaining to women's health, this foundation also helps bring to light severe issues such as the stigmatization of women's health\nInternational Women's Suffrage Alliance \u2013 major suffrage organization\nLeanIn.Org \u2013 founded in 2013, runs programs that counter gender stereotypes and advance opportunities for all women.

She was also a cousin of Stella Bowen's.  She was a member of the Twenty Melbourne Painters. She had a joint exhibition of oils, watercolours and pastels with fellow artists Dora Wilson and May Roxburgh in 1918. Sutherland had a history with Dora Wilson prior to later established artist societies, exhibiting as part of \"The Waddy\" in 1909, along with Janet Cumbrae Stewart and Nora Gurdon. She enjoyed doing landscapes, renting a cottage in Lilydale with Bernice Edwell and Florence Rodway to sketch the surrounding country. She also exhibited with the Yarra Sculptors' Society. \nShe died in 1948.

Founded in 1839, it is the city's oldest cultural institution.\nIts building on Collins Street in the East End Theatre District sits opposite the Regent Theatre, and currently consists of a main theatre, a smaller studio theatre, a restaurant and a subscription library. It has also served as a mechanics' institute, an art exhibition space, and a cinema. \n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe Athenaeum is a restrained boom-style neoclassical three-storey building designed by architects Smith and Johnson with stuccoed facade with pilasters, label moulds, and bracketed cornice. It was completed in 1886 on the site of the original building of 1842, and is surmounted with a parapet with a niche housing a statue by Richard Kretzschmar of Minerva (Athena, hence 'Athenaeum'), goddess of reason, wisdom, arts and literature. The building was added to the National Trust's Register of Historic Buildings in 1981 and is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nIn August 1840, the Melbourne Mechanics Institution acquired land spanning 110 feet along Collins Street and extending to Little Collins Street, for a sum of \u00a3285. The initial structure, a two-story brick building known as the Hall of Arts was completed in December 1842. \nThe first President was Captain William Lonsdale, the first Patron was the Superintendent of Port Phillip, Charles La Trobe and the first books were donated by Vice-President Henry Fyshe Gisborne. Originally called the Melbourne Mechanics' Institute, it was renamed the Melbourne Mechanics' Institution and School of Arts  in 1846.\nThe Melbourne City Council met in the ground floor of the building until 1852 when the Melbourne Town Hall was built. The Institute received an annual grant of \u00a3150 from the government, and in 1854, an additional \u00a35,000 was granted for construction of a new building, but from 1857, it had to rely on its own funds. By 1851, the membership count reached 488 individuals. Additionally, it served as the headquarters for the First Church of Christ, Scientist. \nConstruction on the new building began in 1855, but only the front portion was finished. The rear hall, intended to be designed by Charles Webb, was deferred until 1871 and ultimately completed in 1872. Alfred Smith served as the architect, while Turnbull and Dick were the builders. The Institution changed its name to the Melbourne Athenaeum in 1872  During the period when its own church was being reconstructed, Scots Church utilized the premises as its temporary location. \nAmong the office bearers of the institution in the nineteenth century was the author Marcus Clarke who was the chairman of the library committee in 1877. As now, a focal point was the library and by 1877, membership was 1,681 and in 1879 there were 30,000 visits to the library. In 1880 it was reported 'that the floor of the large hall was the only one in Melbourne expressly constructed for dancing'. The remodeled facade was finally concluded in 1886. The statue of Minerva, which was modelled by Richard Kretzschmar on that at the Vatican, was funded through Alderman Thomas Moubray's gift of 100 guineas.\n\n\n=== Theatre and cinema ===\nIn October 1896, the first movie was shown in the Athenaeum Hall. This may not have been the first in Australia however, as a cinematograph was being demonstrated at the Melbourne Opera House in August. On 26 January 1901 Life in Our Navy, a 60,000 foot film of life on HMS Jupiter, was shown by G. H. Snazelle, who provided additional entertainment. \nThe Hall became a regular venue for screening films and the premiere of The Story of the Kelly Gang by the Tait brothers, the world's first dramatic feature film, was at the Athenaeum in 1906.\nThe theatre in its present form, a proscenium arch theatre with 880 seats on three levels, was created in 1924, designed by Henry\nJanie Wilkinson Whyte (1869\u20131953) was an Australian artist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nWhyte was a painter, etcher, and wood-carver who studied at the National Gallery School from 1890\u20131895 and together with Dora Wilson and Jessie Traill took lessons in etching from John Mather. Their etchings were published in The Lone Hand in 1907 as some of the earliest works in this field made by women. Whyte was an impressionist artist who painted portraits, figure studies, and landscapes, and was one of the first Melbourne women to paint dockyard scenes. She also painted interiors and flowers, and worked with oils, watercolours, and pastels. Her cityscapes contained charming observations of Melbourne life. Whyte showed with the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors in the 1920s.\nAs part of a first wave of feminist artists in Melbourne, Whyte presented a paper at women's cultural group the Austral Salon along with Violet Teague in August 1907.

Her first name is often misspelled Nora in many articles reviewing her work.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nNorah Gurdon was born around Jan-March 1882 in Norfolk, England, to Dr. Edwin John Gurdon and Ellen Ann Randall. She was baptised on 11 April 1882. She was the second of four surviving children, and her family emigrated to Ballarat, Victoria in 1886, travelling on board ship the Carlisle Castle. They eventually settled in Brighton where her father had a doctor's surgery at their home. Gurdon showed early artistic talent while attending Brighton High School for Girls.\n\n\n== Career ==\nGurdon attended the National Gallery School from 1901 to 1908, being taught by noted artists Frederick McCubbin and Bernard Hall. While there she studied with fellow artists Jessie Traill, Dora Wilson, Constance Jenkins, and Janet Cumbrae Stewart, who were to become her lifelong friends. An accomplished landscape and still-life painter, Gurdon exhibited her works with the Victorian Artists Society while still a student. She established her artistic prowess early on by winning the major category for oil painting in the 1909 City of Prahran's Art Exhibition Prize. By the following year she had rented a studio in Collins Street along with friends Stewart and Traill. As well as being a prominent figure in the Melbourne Society of Painters and Sculptors, Gurdon went on to exhibit with fellow National Gallery School alumni in 1913 as part of Twelve Melbourne Painters. The group included Ruth Sutherland, Charles Wheeler, Dora Wilson, May Roxburgh, Percy Leason, Louis McCubbin, Penleigh Boyd, H. B. Harrison, and Frank Cozier.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nIntending to continue her artistic training overseas, in 1914 Gurdon travelled to England with her sister Winifred. Gurdon along with friend Jessie Traill was stuck in Europe due to the outbreak of war ten weeks after arriving. She signed up as a British Red Cross volunteer nurse in a French military hospital at Le Croisic, serving for three and a half years and was awarded a British Victory medal for her services. Much of her painting during this time was landscapes from travels to England and Scotland prior to war breaking out, and when armistice was reached in 1920 she stayed on to paint through Scotland, Suffolk, and Cornwall. This was hardly her only venture overseas however, as she returned in 1927, meeting fellow artists Pegg Clarke and Dora Wilson in Rome, and narrowly avoiding World War II on her 1938 travels to Norway and Sweden.\n\n\n=== Kalorama ===\nUnlike many other female artists of the time, Norah Gurdon was unmarried and financially independent. She purchased land in 1922 with plans to build her dream house in the Dandenong Ranges at Kalorama. When the house was finished she lived there with her sister Winifred and had many fellow artists as guests, with former students and teachers joining her for plen air landscape painting. While Gurdon painted in an impressionist style similar to her contemporaries, she favoured muted blue and grey tones to capture the hills of the Dandenongs. She also enjoyed handicrafts, spending her spare time at tapestry looms designing and producing her own floor rugs and mats.\n\n\tSelected photographs\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nGurdon was a regular and successful exhibitor of work, exhibiting with the Victorian Artists Society, Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, and the Australian Art Association. In the 1920s she held many solo exhibitions at the Athenaeum Gallery, and later at the Women's Industrial Arts Society in Sydney, and the Royal Queensland Art Society in Brisbane. She held an exhibition in 1937 at the Fine Arts Gallery in aid of the construction of St George's Hospital in Kew.\n\n1909\nThe Waddy Club, Guildhall, Melbourne, June 1909\n1910\n\nVictorian Artists' Society, Athenaeum Art Gallery, Melbourne, October 1910\n1911\n\nCity of Pr\nStephanie Taylor (1899\u20131974) was an Australian artist, printmaker, gallerist, lecturer and art writer and broadcaster. She attained a wide audience in the later 1930s when the Australian Broadcasting Commission featured her art programs on radio stations in Sydney and Canberra as well as her hometown of Melbourne.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nTaylor was the daughter of colonial artist, Elizabeth Ball, who studied at the National Gallery School in the 1860s, was elected as an associate of the Victorian Academy of Arts in 1879 and exhibited with that group.  Elizabeth Ball married Captain Charles Taylor and settled in Williamstown where Taylor and her other three siblings were born.\nTaylor studied with sculptor Charles Douglas Richardson, who became a lifelong friend and whose memorial exhibition she organised in 1933. She also studied at the National Gallery of Victoria School from 1914 to 1922. After leaving the school she shared a studio in Collins Street with fellow Gallery student Dorothy Moore. She showed with the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors in the 1920s.\nTaylor was a competent etcher in the English painter-etcher tradition and a watercolourist. Her greatest impression on her contemporaries was, however, as a lecturer, broadcaster and gallerist, as an incipient iteration of the later curatorial profession. She also published art criticism in the 1930s with the Melbourne journal Adam and Eve.\n\n\n== Cultural impact as an art lecturer ==\nTaylor was best known as a lecturer on the history of art in Melbourne and presented lectures during the 1930s at the National Gallery of Victoria. Although she was opposed to modernism, she supported the Gallery's purchasing of expensive European masterworks. She presented exhibition reviews and lectures on art for ABC radio as early as the 1920s as well as teaching a course in the history of Australian Art at the Emily McPherson College and also in 1934 an art history course for the University of Melbourne. The Sydney Morning Herald claimed that \u2018hundreds of art lovers\u2019 had enjoyed her lectures and noted that the Athenaeum Club had made a list of outstanding public lectures delivered in Melbourne and that Taylor had been selected for this honour alongside major scholars from the University of Melbourne of that era,\nProfessors Osborne and Crawford and Sir Ernest Fiske. Perhaps her greatest impact on Australian cultural life was her active lobbying for the establishment of a School of Art History at the University of Melbourne in the 1930s. Her suggestion that the University should teach historical and theoretical matters around art predates the establishment of the Herald Chair of Fine Arts by nearly a decade.\n\n\n== Feminist art advocacy ==\nUnlike many women artists in Australia prior to the 1970s with the exception of Portia Geach, Taylor made many pro-feminist public statements, particularly in relation to equal representation and visibility of artists in the Australian art market. In 1940 she led a deputation to the Chief secretary of Victoria complaining that the director of the National Gallery of Victoria, James Stuart MacDonald was opposed to women artists. \"Most of the few examples of work by women artists are kept in basements and storerooms that are not accessible to the public,\" she said. \"It is rare for a piece by a woman to be purchased for the collection.\" In 1929 she criticised Arthur Streeton for mentioning only one woman artist in an article outlining the history of Australian art. She stated that works by \u201870 or 80\u2019 Australian women artists had been bought by public galleries across the country and listed a group of Australian women who had received major awards and honours overseas. In 1939 she wrote to the editor of the Age  \"I still maintain that there is a popular prejudice against women in the fine arts.\"\n\n\n== Later career ==\nDuring the 1940s she was no longer employed by the National Gallery of Victoria but managed the Velasquez Gallery in Tye's store, 100\nIsabel May (Diana) Tweddle  (1875\u20131945), was an Australian painter.  She was a member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors and the Twenty Melbourne Painters Society Inc.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nTweddle was born Isabel May Hunter on 26 November 1875 in New South Wales. From 1894 through 1897 she studied at the National Gallery School in Melbourne. There she met fellow artist Ada May Plante.\nAfter her studies she began exhibiting at the Victorian Artists Society. In 1904 she married Joseph Thornton Tweddle, an Australian businessman and philanthropist. The couple traveled throughout Europe, and lived in London, England in 1921. Tweddle visited Scandinavia and the Pacific (the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, and Japan). Her paintings from  those trips were exhibited in London.\nTweddle had an interest in Post-Impressionist art, mainly though the work of Arnold Shore and William Frater. She is thought to have influenced Sybil Craig, Peggie Crombie and Jessie Mackintosh.\nShe was a member of many artistic groups in Melbourne; the Contemporary Art Group, the Contemporary Art Society, the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, and the Women's Art Club.\nHer paintings are in the collections of the Shepparton Art Museum, the National Gallery of Victoria, and the Art Gallery of New South Wales.\nShe died  on 9 July 1945 in Melbourne.\nTweddle Place in the Canberra suburb of Chisholm is named in her honour.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n1943, from 1 December; Inclusion in a group show of ninety-one paintings and etchings with Arnold Shore, Max Meldrum, John Rowell, Jas.

She studied art at the National Gallery School under W.B. McInnes, later doing weekend classes at George Bell's Bourke Street studio in the 1930s. She studied at the Gallery School at the same time as Sybil Craig, Constance Stokes, and Helen Ogilvie, though they were in different classes. Her mother didn't want her to continue studying art, and got her to go work at a flower shop instead. Bernard Hall allowed her to continue studying part time, a privilege not afforded to many at the time.\nShe first exhibited with The New Group at the Athenaeum Gallery in 1937, at a show consisting of still-life, landscape, and drawings. The group consisted of artists Albert Tucker and Hal Porter, and Maidie's work The Portrait of Minka was considered second only to Tucker. A review of the show in The Herald by Basil Burdett described her work as showing real promise. McGowan's portrait Manya featured in the Herald Exhibition 'Outstanding Artists of 1937' and alongside Thea Proctor's article in Art in Australia.\nMcGowan attended classes at the Victorian Artists Society with her future husband Colin around this time. She was a founding member of the Contemporary Art Society and later a three-terms President of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors. Her and Colin married in 1948 and moved to Mount Eliza, mostly withdrawing from the art scene. They later returned in 1954 by invitation to help launch the Peninsula Arts Society. She was encouraged to return to practicing art during this time by George Bell, returning to his classes while also teaching art at Mount Eliza.\nColin worked in printing at an advertising firm, and Maidie's work Collage of Screenprinted Paper was made out of posters he screenprinted. She would gift this work to Bell on his 80th birthday. In the 1960s McGowan would become the first secretary of the McClelland Gallery Group, with Colin printing and designing the invitations and catalogues. The group's membership included artists such as Daryl Lindsay. Her work and experience led to her assisting in curation for two exhibitions at the National Gallery of Victoria in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nApril\u2013May 1978, Paintings of Figure and Landscape by Maidie McGowan, Clive Parry Galleries\nApril\u2013May 1988, George Bell Students & Friends, Holland Fine Art\nOctober 1988, Jim Alexander Gallery Spring Exhibition\nMay\u2013June 1990, Modern Australian Paintings, Bridget McDonnell Gallery (with Sidney Nolan, Arthur Boyd, Charles Blackman)\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMaidie McGowan retrospective : November 4, 1995 \u2013 January 7, 1996, State Library Victoria\nForm and flowers : Maidie McGowan, Anne Montgomery, Marjorie Woolcock, State Library Victoria\nNew Group, Melbourne, Vic. : Australian Gallery File, State Library Victoria\nMaidie McGowan : Australian Art and Artists file, Art Gallery of New South Wales Research Library and Archive\nBiographical cuttings on Maidie McGowan, National Library of Australia\n\n\n== References ==\nAlice Marian Ellen Bale, known as A.M.E.

She was an only child, and her family had houses in both Kew and Castlemaine.\nShe studied art under Frederick McCubbin and Lindsay Bernard Hall at the National Gallery School 1895\u20131904.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBale came to prominence as an artist in Melbourne in the 1920s and 1930s, developing a reputation as one of Australia's pre-eminent flower and still life painters. Distancing herself from her fellow female artists who were more aligned with the suffragette movement, Bale preferred to work hard within the constraints of the traditional structures of the art world, and never left Victoria. \nAn active member of the Pickwick Club of Kew, she would gather with young members, some of whom were fellow Gallery School students, for weekly discussions where they adopted the personas of Charles Dickens' characters. There she developed an intimacy with fellow club member Norman Brown, which came to an end by 1906 with Brown's departure and Bale's reluctance to leave her ordered family life.\nAs a painter Bale did landscapes and portraits but was best known for her flower studies. She was able to sell her paintings and exhibit in not just Australia but also London and Paris.\nShe exhibited with the Melbourne Society of Women Painters 1917\u20131955.\n\n\n== Other activities ==\nBale edited the Victorian Artists' Society's journal VAS before her efforts to reform the society in 1917 and 1918 and an election loss got her ousted as a troublemaker.

Her parents were James Wilson, agent, and Annie Maria, n\u00e9e Green. The family emigrated to the state of Victoria in Australia in 1884, when Dora was a year old.\n\n\n== Education ==\nWilson was educated at Somerset School and Methodist Ladies' College in Melbourne. From 1901\u20131906 she studied at the National Gallery under Bernard Hall and Frederick McCubbin, forming friendships with fellow artists Ruth Hollick, Gwendolyn Grant, Norah Gurdon, and her partner Pegg Clarke. She also took lessons from John Mather with Jessie Traill and Janie Wilkinson Whyte.\n\n\n== Artistic career ==\nWilson was best known for her etchings, pastels and oils of still lifes and nudes. Her work was praised for her 'strong sense of colour' but also critiqued for demonstrating a 'chocolate box prettiness'.\nHer work was included in a number of notable exhibitions, including the five week Australian Exhibition of Women's Work in Melbourne, a Royal Academy exhibition of Australian art in London. In 1923 her work, 'Reve d'Or', was reproduced on the cover of Women's World and exhibited at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Fran\u00e7ais in Paris.\nHer studio at Collins Street West was the meeting place of ex\u2013Gallery School students who exhibited in 1913\u201314 as 'The Twelve Melbourne Painters.' This group included Jessie Traill, Janet Cumbrae Stewart, Norah Gurdon, Penleigh Boyd, and Lindsay Bernard Hall. Wilson was also a member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors.\nFrom the 1920s onwards she concentrated largely on street scenes, and in  1923 she was commissioned by Sir Baldwin Spencer to undertake a series of paintings of European landmarks, which saw her travelling around Europe for over two years, accompanied by the photographer Pegg Clarke. In 1928 these works were exhibited at the Beaux Arts Gallery, London, and the following year at Australia House. In the early 1930s she focused on historical scenes from Melbourne's history, with an exhibition entitled 'Milestones of Melbourne' held at the Fine Art Society Gallery in March 1935. Her work was received favorably by Arthur Streeton for being \"fresh in colour and treatment and free from the depressing appearance of black paint.\" In 1937 she joined and exhibited with Robert Menzies' Australian Academy of Art.\n\n\tDora L Wilson, Pictures Collection, State Library Victoria\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Death ==\nWilson died of cancer on 21 November 1946 and was cremated at Springvale Cemetery, Melbourne.

She went to school at Girton College in Bendigo and then studied drawing and sculpture at the Bendigo School of Mines. She continued her studies in Melbourne at Swinburne Technical College and then at the Royal College of Art in London. On her return to Melbourne in 1930 she established a studio at Grosvenor Chambers (9 Collins Street, Melbourne, subsequently occupied by Georges and Mirka Mora), later moving to Gipps Street, East Melbourne.\n\n\n== Works ==\nCohn's works in bronze, stone and wood are held in many state and regional galleries. Important works include:\n\nthe Fairies' Tree in the Fitzroy Gardens, Melbourne which she sculpted between 1931 and 1934 and donated to the children of Melbourne and\nthe statue for the Pioneer Women's Memorial Garden in Adelaide, South Australia, carved in limestone in 1940\u20131941.\nThe Fairies Tree work also inspired her writing and publication of The Fairies' Tree (1932), More about the Fairies' Tree (1933) and Castles in the Air (1936). Her book Mostly Cats was published in 1964. In 2014 her autobiography was published; A Way with the Fairies: The Lost Story of Sculptor Ola Cohn.\n\n\n== Career and influence ==\nShe was president of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors from 1948 to 1964, a founding member of the Australian Sculptors Society and an active member of the Victorian Artists' Society, the Victorian Sculptors' Society and Melbourne Contemporary Artists.\nThrough her membership of artists' and sculptors' societies, Cohn gave lectures and demonstrations to make sculpture more accessible to the public. Private instruction in sculpture was given from her studio in East Melbourne, which became an important centre for artists. During the Second World War, she gave recreational sculpture lessons for soldiers.\nCohn travelled through Europe and Iceland from 1949 to 1951. In 1952, she won the Crouch Prize at Ballarat for her woodcarving, \"Abraham\". This was the first time that the prize had been awarded to a sculpture.\nHer studio home in Gipps Street, East Melbourne, was bequeathed to the Council of Adult Education (since renamed the Centre for Adult Education) and is now known as the Ola Cohn Memorial Centre.\nIn 2002, the Centre for Adult Education considered selling Cohn's studio to raise money for new buildings. A public campaign at the time motivated the Victorian state government to intercede and fund the restoration of the Ola Cohn Memorial Centre Her studio at Gipps Street is still under the control of the CAE and is heritage listed.\n\n\n== Honours and awards ==\nOn 1 January 1965, shortly after her death, Cohn was appointed a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for her work in the service of art, especially sculpture. In 2007, she was added to the Victorian Honour Roll of Women.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\nABC Radio - Hindsight, Broadcast 28 September 2008, The Word in the Stone: sculptor Ola Cohn\n\n\n== External links ==\nPapers of Ola Cohn, 1912\u20131964, State Library Victoria\nPolly Hurry (2 May, 1883, Kyneton - 5 August 1963, Frankston), was an Australian painter. She was a founding member of the Australian Tonalist movement and part of the Twenty Melbourne Painters Society.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDescribed in a 2009 review by Sasha Grishin as \u201ca South Australian Meldrumite who has been almost totally forgotten,\u201d Mary 'Polly' Hurry in fact was born in Kyneton, Victoria, on 2 May, 1883, daughter of Henry Hurry and Mary Herring and the middle child of two siblings, Maurice and George. She spent her early years there at the family home South Lodge, 29 Donnithorne Street, then was educated at Ruyton Girls' School, Kew.\n\n\n== Training ==\nLater, at the Kyneton School of Mines, Hurry took lessons in drawing and wood carving, then studied watercolour painting with the Scottish-born artist, John Mather. During a camping holiday she met several artists, who like Mather were associates of the tonalist Max Meldrum, and decided to take up art seriously. She began drawing from life at Melbourne's 1859 Old Temple Court building where studios were occupied by students of Frederick McCubbin; Jessie Traill, Dora Wilson, Janet Cumbrae Stewart, Norah Gurdon and AME Bale; before approaching Meldrum to join his studio as one of the first of his pupils, alongside Harry McClelland.\n\n\n== Australian tonalist artist ==\nHurry regarded Meldrum as the most important influence on her artistic development, but the association also shaped her personal life; in Meldrum\u2019s studio she met John Farmer whom she married on 13 August 1921. Farmer (1897-1989) was a close friend of fellow student 10 years younger, Justus Jorgensen, when both attended the National Gallery School in 1914, where he also met Clarice Beckett and Colin Colahan. Brought up in a large family in Brunswick, Farmer worked as a scenery painter for J.C. Williamson Ltd. Richard McCullin, a drawing master at the Gallery School, suggested that students might be interested in going to hear a lecture in 1917 by controversial young painter, Max Meldrum, who argued that \"the art of painting is a pure science - the science of optical analysis.\"\n\nHurry became a founding member of the original Twenty Melbourne Painters Society \u2014 Jas Stuart Anderson, Alice Bale, Elsie Barlow, Alexander Colquhoun, George Colville, Edith Downing, Bernice Edwell, William Frater, Henrietta Maria Gulliver, Carl Hampel, C.E. James, Richard McCann, Bertha Merfield, A.E. Newbury, Clara Southern, Ruth Sutherland, Jo Sweatman,  Isobel Tweddle, and Rose A. Walker  \u2014 all supporters and students of Meldrum, which split from The Victorian Artists Society in protest at his defeat in the 1918 election for its president. In 1919, the breakaway group held their first exhibition. Twenty Melbourne Painters Society founding Secretary A.M.E. Bale declared:\u201cWe desire nothing but sincerity and a humble study of nature, from which alone all art, whether decorative or realistic, draws any enduring life.\u201d\nAlso in 1921, Hurry entered the inaugural Archibald Prize, in which 41 works were submitted and all exhibited from 17 January 1922 for two months. The Prize was awarded to WB McInnes, but no catalogue for the 1921 exhibition has been found, and the subject of the work submitted by Hurry is not known. \nThe couple shared one of the purpose-built studios (Studio 2) at the 1888 Grosvenor Chambers, 9 Collins Street, Melbourne (its name a direct reference to Grosvenor Gallery of London) occupied also at various times by Meldrum, Tom Roberts, Frederick McCubbin, Arthur Streeton, Percival Ball, Charles Francis Summers, Clara Southern, Jane Sutherland, Charles Conder, E.

She had a younger sister Hazel, also an artist, and their father built them a studio at the back of their Loch Street home in Surrey Hills, Victoria. Her family was associated with amateur theatre group 'The Benwerrin Players'.  Mabel had to be rescued when swimming at Moon Bay near Black Rock when she was 19, which she visited with her family. She studied at the National Gallery School with Adelaide Perry and Napier Wallace under Bernard Hall. She studied drawing from 1912-1915, and painting 1915-1919.\n\n\n== Career ==\nWorking in watercolours and linocuts, Pye painted landscapes, still-lifes, and portraits with bold colours and lines. She was a member of the Victorian Artists Society from 1918-1941, and the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, with whom she served on the committee with Esther Paterson, Ola Cohn, Jessie Mackintosh, Sybil Craig, Lina Bryans, and Violet McInnes. As well as exhibiting with both societies she also protested to the Lord Mayor about destruction of trees on Alexandra Avenue.\nShe was particularly noted for her ballet scenes.

She studied drawing at the School of Mines, Ballarat, where she was taught by David Davies. She also studied under Frederick McCubbin at the National Gallery School in Melbourne. Her aunt, Elizabeth Glover, owned \"Gracedale Hotel\" in Healesville. Fleay did a painting of \"Gracedale\", which hung in Elizabeth Glover's home in Gardenvale.\nShe exhibited with the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors and she was a member of the Victorian Artists Society. In 1938 she exhibited at the Athenaeum Gallery with fellow women artists Annie Gates and Henrietta Maria Gulliver. Glover Fleay exhibited at the Leighton Galleries in 1945 where her work was commended for its \"rather unfeminine strength and confidence of approach.\" Noted artist Arthur Streeton said her paintings \"reflect great sympathy with and knowledge of the animals.\" She was also a writer and music teacher, and art director of the Daylesford School of Mines.\nIn 1905 she married William Henry Fleay at St. Peter's Church of England, Sturt Street, Ballarat. They had three children, including the naturalist David Fleay.

Much of her career was spent in France and in Australia, where she was associated with the movement known as the Heidelberg School.\n\n\n== Life ==\nEthel Carrick was born in Uxbridge, Middlesex, to Emma (Filmer) Carrick and Albert William Carrick, a wealthy draper. The family of ten children lived at Brookfield House, Uxbridge. She trained in London at the Guildhall School of Music and at the Slade School of Fine Art under Henry Tonks (ca. 1898-1903). She married the Australian Impressionist painter Emanuel Phillips Fox in 1905. They moved to Paris, where they remained until 1913. She travelled widely in Europe, North Africa, and the South Pacific (Tahiti) during this period and made trips to Australia in 1908 and 1913.\nThe outbreak of World War I brought Carrick and her husband to Melbourne, Australia, where they  organised to raise war funds from artists and to support the French Red Cross.\nEmanuel died of cancer in 1915, and the following year Carrick began two decades of travels that took her through the Middle East, South Asia including India, and Europe. She returned intermittently to Australia to exhibit her work and go out on painting expeditions around the country. In the 1920s, she was recommended by the Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re in Paris as a private teacher of still life painting, and she counted a number of Australians and Americans in Paris among her students.\nShe died in Melbourne in 1952, aged 80.\n\n\n== Art career and critical estimation ==\n\nMainly a painter, Carrick is known for her floral still life, landscapes and scenes of outdoor urban life in parks and on beaches. Some of these draw on her international travels, such as her paintings of outdoor markets in the Middle East and elsewhere. In the 1920s, she began painting flower studies, which overall are more conventional than her earlier work. In the 1930s, she created some lithographs, and during World War II, which she spent in Australia, she painted some scenes of women war workers.\nCarrick began as an Impressionist plein air painter but fairly quickly moved to a more Post-Impressionist style featuring blockier compositions and sharper colour contrasts. Some of the works produced around 1911-12 are distinctly Fauvist in their strong colours, high abstraction, and loose handling of the paint.\nCarrick first showed her work in London in 1903. She exhibited at the Paris Salon d'Automne from 1906 onwards, the London Royal Academy of Arts, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts (from 1906 on), and various progressive galleries in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia (from 1908 on). In addition to her own solo and group exhibitions, she was in dual shows with her husband at the Melbourne Athenaeum in 1914 and again in 1944. \nIn 1911, she became soci\u00e9taire of the Salon d'Automne, and she served as a jury member from 1912 to around 1925, both unusual positions for women to hold and marks of the high regard in which she was held by the Paris art world. Prior to World War I, she also served as the vice-president of the International Union of Women Artists. Late in her career, in the 1940s and 1950s, she exhibited with the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors.\nIn her lifetime, Carrick's reputation was eclipsed by her husband's, in part because she spent a good deal of her time promoting his career rather than her own, lobbying Australian collectors and curators to buy his work and arranging exhibitions both while he was alive and posthumously. In recent years, her reputation has been rising, and critics today consider her work more adventurous than that of her husband. In 1996, one of her paintings set an auction record of A$105,500 for works by an Australian woman artist, and the following year saw the publication of a biography, Ethel Carrick Fox: Travels and Triumphs of a Post-Impressionist by art historian Susanna de Vries.\nClara Southern (3 October 1860 \u2013 15 December 1940) was an Australian artist associated with the Heidelberg School, also known as Australian Impressionism. She was active between the years 1883 and her death in 1940. Physically, Southern was tall with reddish fair hair, and was nicknamed 'Panther' because of her lithe beauty.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nSouthern was born in Kyneton, Victoria, in 1860, the eldest of six children. She was the daughter of local timber merchant and farmer John Southern and Jane Elliott. From 1883 to 1887, Southern studied at the School of Design, National Gallery of Victoria under Oswald Rose Campbell and at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School under George Folingsby and Frederick McCubbin.\nDuring her studies she joined the Buonarotti Club, a bohemian society of writers, painters and musicians to which other members of the Heidelberg School belonged. She is credited by some as 'among the first women to be elected' to it in 1886, though several other female artists were already members, and amateur poet and painter Alice Brotherton had been the first woman elected to the Club in 1883, followed by several other important women artists such as Jane Sutherland and May Vale, who both joined in 1884.\nSouthern was a member of the Victorian Artists Society, the Australian Art Association, the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, the Twenty Melbourne Painters, and the Lyceum Club. Paving the way for women's involvement in the arts, Southern was the first female member of the Australian Artists' Association.\nWhen in Melbourne Southern shared a studio at Grosvenor Chambers, 9 Collins Street, with Jane Sutherland and Tom Roberts from 1888. She taught art classes from her studio, and regularly joined her Heidelberg School colleagues on plein air painting trips to Heidelberg and Eaglemont.\n\n\n== Warrandyte ==\nBy 1908 Southern had established an artistic community of younger landscape painters at Warrandyte, a township on the Yarra about 30 kilometres from Melbourne. The community included Penleigh Boyd and Harold Herbert. Her teacher and mentor Walter Withers often visited her in Warrandyte to paint the landscape. Her residence at cottage 'Blythe Bank' in Warrandyte was integral to the development of the artistic community there, with regular visits from the McCubbins and Colquhouns, and Jo Sweatman becoming her neighbour at 'Kipsy.' Many of her works capture the spirit of the area, such as 'Evensong' and 'A Cool Corner', and she encouraged many a young artist to visit her studio there. At one point she was regarded as the eminent female landscape artist in Melbourne.\nOn 9 November 1905, Southern married local miner John Arthur Flinn at St. John's Anglican Church in Blackburn. Together they built a cottage, and later a studio, at Blythe Bank, Warrandyte. Even after her marriage, Southern continued to exhibit under her own name.\nAn Old Bee Farm, held by the National Gallery of Victoria is one of her better known works. It was one of 56 paintings included in Lloyd O'Neil's Classic Australian Paintings, and was used as the cover illustration for Kay Schaffer's 1988 book Women and the Bush: Forces of Desire in the Australian Cultural Tradition.\n\nClara was also supportive of charity and relief efforts, supporting Violet Teague and her sister Una in an exhibition for the Hermannsburg Mission Water Supply in Central Australia. Bushfires were a devastating risk in her township of Warrandyte, and she contributed to the Artists' Bushfire Relief Fund Exhibition. Unfortunately some time after her death, her beloved cottage 'Blythe Bank' was lost to bushfires.Miss Clara Southern (Mrs J. Flinn) is a sweet and original singer of the Australian bush in colour, which, by the most skilful use of her pigments, she realises in all its beauty and charm, its majestic silences, its harmonies, and those mysterious distances we all know and feel when in its midst. We can almost hear the wind sighing and sobbing through her tr\nJane Rebecca Price (18 February 1860 \u2013 24 May 1948) was an Australian painter who was a foundation member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors. Two of her works have been acquired by the National Gallery of Victoria and two by the Art Gallery of South Australia.  She was a close associate of members of the group of painters known as the Heidelberg school.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nPrice was born in Cheddar, Somerset, England, on 18 February 1860. Her father, William Thomas Price, was a clergyman, her mother was Rebecca Jane Evans; she had five siblings.\nPrice trained as an artist at the Royal College of Art (RCA) in London (then called the South Kensington Art School).\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nAt the age of 20, Price migrated from England to Sydney, then moved to Melbourne two years later.  She returned to Sydney several times (1907\u20131910, 1925, 1935) but lived chiefly in Melbourne\u2019s suburbs, spending her final 13 years in St. Kilda, at the house of her friend Ina Gregory, another artist who is associated with the Heidelberg school.\nPrice continually painted throughout her life, but, needing an income and somewhere to live, also worked as a governess, which reduced her productivity as an artist. She was a governess for artists Alexander and Beatrix Colquhoun from 1903, and later for Frederick and Annie McCubbin. Her paintings were exhibited by the Victorian Artists Society between 1882 and 1906, and at other places in Melbourne.\nPrice enjoyed life-long friendship with artists who were central to the circle that came to be known as the Heidelberg school.  Amongst her closest associates were Jane Sutherland, Clara Southern, Tom Roberts and Frederick McCubbin. Hammond and Peers  record that Price is mentioned in a letter written by McCubbin to Roberts  noting that he was pleased to see that \"Janey Price did very well\" in an exhibition held at McCubbin's house in Shipley St, South Yarra, in 1906.  A number of her paintings were sold at the exhibition, according to Hammond and Peers.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nPrice died on 24 May 1948 at the age of 88, living in the house shared with her friend and fellow artist, Ina Gregory.\nJane Price Crescent in the Canberra suburb of Conder is named in her honour.\nSince her death there have been several exhibitions that have included her work, for example:\n\n1988 The Australian Impressionists: Their Origins and Influences, Lauraine Diggins, North Caulfield \n1992 Completing the Picture: Women Artists of the Heidelberg Era, travelling exhibition curated by Artmoves \n1993 A Century of Australian Women Artists 1840s -1940s, Deutscher Galleries, Melbourne \nHer work is represented in The National Gallery of Victoria and the Art Gallery of South Australia:\n\nThe Patch, Kallista, 1941 (inscribed on the reverse of the painting:  \u201cview from Tom Robert\u2019s Studio\u201d).
