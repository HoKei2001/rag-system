She spent the 1920s and 1930s painting in Britain, France and Italy.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCumbrae Stewart was born on 23 December 1883 in Brighton, Victoria, Australia. She was born Janet Agnes Stewart, the youngest of ten children born to Francis Edward Stewart (1833–1904) and Agnes Park (1843–1927). Janet's eldest brother, Francis William Sutton Stewart, became convinced of a family connection to the Stuarts of Bute and despite never proving the link, adopted \"Cumbrae\" to his name, and his siblings followed suit. This addition to the name would later serve a greater purpose for Janet, who quickly abandoned the hyphen and identified herself professionally as simply Cumbrae Stewart, and so avoided, to a certain extent, the limitations and scrutiny attached to her sex.\nThe Stewarts lived a very traditional upper middle class existence, with the boys studying at private school and the three girls receiving their early education at home under the supervision of a governess. As well as her lessons, Cumbrae Stewart also received instruction in several suitable 'past-times' including dancing, piano and drawing; this latter she was instructed by Zena Beatrice Selwyn, who would later marry Cumbrae Stewart's brother Francis in 1906. During her late teens, Cumbrae Stewart joined landscape painter, John Mather, and his students, on outdoor sketching exhibitions.\nFrom 1903 though 1908 Cumbrae Stewart studied at the Melbourne National Gallery School, where she was taught by Lindsay Bernard Hall and Frederick McCubbin. During this time she won a slew of awards: first prize for Drawing from Antique in 1904, Still Life Painting in 1905, Second place for Half Nude Painting and Life Drawing in 1906, and third prize for Drawing a Head from Life in 1903 and third place in the coveted Travelling Scholarship prize in 1908 for The Old Gown in 1908 (first and second places were both awarded to Constance Jenkins).\nFollowing her art education, Cumbrae Stewart rented premises in Melbourne and commenced exhibiting. She participated in the first Exhibition of Women's Work held in Melbourne in 1907, and exhibited with the Victorian Artists Society from 1908 to 1920. She also exhibited with the Queensland Art Society, the Australian Artists Association and the South Australian Society of Arts, as well as the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors. She held her first solo exhibition at the Coles Book Arcade gallery in Collins Street in 1911, from which Bernard Hall purchased a pastel of a head, and Rupert Bunny purchased a landscape. Other solo exhibitions were regularly held at the Athenaeum Hall in Melbourne, Gayfield Shaw's Salon in Sydney and Preece's Gallery in South Australia, under the management of Gayfield Shaw.\nIn 1922 Cumbrae Stewart travelled to England with her sister, Beatrice Peverill, on board the Aeneas, arriving in Liverpool on 21 July. In an interview with the Brisbane Telegraph, Beatrice reports on a journey during which her sister was kept extremely busy with commissions from fellow passengers, working from a small studio space created by the ship's captain, below the bridge. The journey apparently concluded with a small exhibition of portraits and travel sketches held in the music room.\nPrior to embarking on the journey, Janet had organised for a ship to carry over a selection of works with which she intended to commence immediate exhibition. Upon its arrival however, she was devastated to find that the vast majority had been destroyed in transit and she had to quickly set about replacing them, and so finding a studio became an immediate priority. She held her first solo exhibition in February 1923 at Walkers Galleries in London. This was a tremendous success financially and socially. Several prominent London society ladies turned out to view the works and Cumbrae Stewart was kept immediately busy thereafter with commissions. Reports als\nStewart is a Scottish and English surname, also used as a given name. It is possibly derived from the old English word \"stigweard\", a compound of \"stig\" meaning household, and \"weard\", a guardian (ward), or from the Gaelic Stiùbhart meaning steward. Alternative spellings are Stuart, Steward and Steuart. The surname Stewart has large concentrations in the United States (mainly in the Deep South, and the other southern states), United Kingdom (mainly in Scotland, Northern Ireland, North East England, South West England, Cumbria, Lancashire, and Yorkshire), Canada, Jamaica, New Zealand, Australia and elsewhere that has large Scottish or Ulster Scots diaspora.\nThe progenitor of the Stewart family was Alan fitz Flaad, a Breton knight who settled in England after the Norman Conquest. His son, Walter fitz Alan, relocated to Scotland during the Anarchy and became the High Steward of Scotland, hence the origin of the surname. In 2014, Stewart was the 66th-most common surname in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== House of Stewart ==\n\nOne of the hereditary Stewart stewards, Walter Stewart, married Marjorie Bruce, daughter of King Robert I, and founded the royal House of Stewart, beginning with their son King Robert II. The House of Stewart was the longest serving royal dynasty of Scotland. Mary, Queen of Scots formalised the use of the spelling Stuart, while resident in France, in order to preserve the correct pronunciation. In 1603, the Stewart King James VI of Scotland became King James I of England and Wales by his succession to Queen Elizabeth I. The Stewart dynasty ruled Scotland, England and Wales (with an interruption during Cromwell's Commonwealth after the English Civil War) until 1714, when Queen Anne died and the British Crown passed to the German Electors of Hanover.\nThe grandson of James II, Prince Charles Edward Stuart, led the last attempt to restore the Stewart dynasty to the British Crown in 1745-6 and became known to history as \"Bonnie Prince Charlie\". This attempted coup d'état ended in the slaughter of Charles' army at the Battle of Culloden in April, 1746.\n\n\n== Stewart peers ==\nIn addition to the Royal House of Stuart, various branches of the Stewart family became Scottish peers, at various times holding the Marquisate of Bute, the earldoms of Atholl, Mar, Moray, Angus, Galloway, as well as several Lordships of Parliament. Several families of Stewarts became Highland clans in their own right, including the Stewarts of Appin, the Stewarts of Ardvorlich, the Stewarts of Atholl and the Stewarts of Garth.\n\n\n== Diaspora ==\nMany Stewart emigrants from the lowlands of Scotland settled in the Irish province of Ulster in the seventeenth century.  Stewarts also emigrated from other parts of Scotland and settled throughout the rest of Ireland.\n\n\n== People named Stewart ==\n\n\n=== Surname ===\nAdam Stewart (disambiguation), multiple people\nAl Stewart (born 1945), Scottish singer-songwriter\nAlana Stewart (born 1945), American actress, former wife of Rod Stewart\nAlastair Stewart (born 1952), British journalist and broadcaster\nAlec Stewart (born 1963), British cricketer, kept wicket for England\nAlexander P.

Her first name is often misspelled Nora in many articles reviewing her work.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nNorah Gurdon was born around Jan-March 1882 in Norfolk, England, to Dr. Edwin John Gurdon and Ellen Ann Randall. She was baptised on 11 April 1882. She was the second of four surviving children, and her family emigrated to Ballarat, Victoria in 1886, travelling on board ship the Carlisle Castle. They eventually settled in Brighton where her father had a doctor's surgery at their home. Gurdon showed early artistic talent while attending Brighton High School for Girls.\n\n\n== Career ==\nGurdon attended the National Gallery School from 1901 to 1908, being taught by noted artists Frederick McCubbin and Bernard Hall. While there she studied with fellow artists Jessie Traill, Dora Wilson, Constance Jenkins, and Janet Cumbrae Stewart, who were to become her lifelong friends. An accomplished landscape and still-life painter, Gurdon exhibited her works with the Victorian Artists Society while still a student. She established her artistic prowess early on by winning the major category for oil painting in the 1909 City of Prahran's Art Exhibition Prize. By the following year she had rented a studio in Collins Street along with friends Stewart and Traill. As well as being a prominent figure in the Melbourne Society of Painters and Sculptors, Gurdon went on to exhibit with fellow National Gallery School alumni in 1913 as part of Twelve Melbourne Painters. The group included Ruth Sutherland, Charles Wheeler, Dora Wilson, May Roxburgh, Percy Leason, Louis McCubbin, Penleigh Boyd, H. B. Harrison, and Frank Cozier.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nIntending to continue her artistic training overseas, in 1914 Gurdon travelled to England with her sister Winifred. Gurdon along with friend Jessie Traill was stuck in Europe due to the outbreak of war ten weeks after arriving. She signed up as a British Red Cross volunteer nurse in a French military hospital at Le Croisic, serving for three and a half years and was awarded a British Victory medal for her services. Much of her painting during this time was landscapes from travels to England and Scotland prior to war breaking out, and when armistice was reached in 1920 she stayed on to paint through Scotland, Suffolk, and Cornwall. This was hardly her only venture overseas however, as she returned in 1927, meeting fellow artists Pegg Clarke and Dora Wilson in Rome, and narrowly avoiding World War II on her 1938 travels to Norway and Sweden.\n\n\n=== Kalorama ===\nUnlike many other female artists of the time, Norah Gurdon was unmarried and financially independent. She purchased land in 1922 with plans to build her dream house in the Dandenong Ranges at Kalorama. When the house was finished she lived there with her sister Winifred and had many fellow artists as guests, with former students and teachers joining her for plen air landscape painting. While Gurdon painted in an impressionist style similar to her contemporaries, she favoured muted blue and grey tones to capture the hills of the Dandenongs. She also enjoyed handicrafts, spending her spare time at tapestry looms designing and producing her own floor rugs and mats.\n\n\tSelected photographs\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nGurdon was a regular and successful exhibitor of work, exhibiting with the Victorian Artists Society, Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, and the Australian Art Association. In the 1920s she held many solo exhibitions at the Athenaeum Gallery, and later at the Women's Industrial Arts Society in Sydney, and the Royal Queensland Art Society in Brisbane. She held an exhibition in 1937 at the Fine Arts Gallery in aid of the construction of St George's Hospital in Kew.\n\n1909\nThe Waddy Club, Guildhall, Melbourne, June 1909\n1910\n\nVictorian Artists' Society, Athenaeum Art Gallery, Melbourne, October 1910\n1911\n\nCity of Pr\nRuth Sutherland (1884–1948), was an Australian painter and art critic.

She was granddaughter to notable sketcher George Sutherland, who emigrated to Australia from Scotland. She was a pupil of Gwen Barringer in South Australia before coming to Melbourne. She attended the National Gallery of Victoria Art School where she was taught by Lindsay Bernard Hall.\nSutherland wrote articles for the Melbourne newspaper 'The Age' and to the journal 'Art in Australia' about Max Meldrum and Hilda Rix Nicholas. \nSutherland was the niece of the painter Jane Sutherland and the sister of the composer Margaret Sutherland. She was also a cousin of Stella Bowen's.  She was a member of the Twenty Melbourne Painters. She had a joint exhibition of oils, watercolours and pastels with fellow artists Dora Wilson and May Roxburgh in 1918. Sutherland had a history with Dora Wilson prior to later established artist societies, exhibiting as part of \"The Waddy\" in 1909, along with Janet Cumbrae Stewart and Nora Gurdon. She enjoyed doing landscapes, renting a cottage in Lilydale with Bernice Edwell and Florence Rodway to sketch the surrounding country. She also exhibited with the Yarra Sculptors' Society. \nShe died in 1948. A memorial exhibition of her work referred to her as \"a quiet artist in a mode of painting now largely abandoned\" and that her works were most sympathetic.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n\tWatercolour paintings by Ruth Sutherland\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n1909, \"The Waddy\" society of artists, Guild Hall\n1909, Federal Art Exhibition, North terrace\n1911, Yarra Sculptors Society, Athenaeum Hall\n1912, \"The Waddy\" society (with Dora Taylor and Janet Cumbrae Stewart), Tuckett and Styles' Gallery\n1912, Group exhibition (with Dora Wilson and Nora Gurdon), Tuckett and Styles' Gallery\n1912 Victorian Artists Society autumn exhibition, Albert Street galleries\n1913, Group exhibition, Athenaeum Hall\n1914, Australian Art Association, Athenaeum Hall\n1914, British History Tableaux (in aid of Red Cross), Victorian Artists Society\n1914, Twelve Melbourne Painters Society second exhibition, Athenaeum Hall\n1915, Victorian Artists Society twentieth annual exhibition\n1916, Victorian Artists Society annual exhibition\n1916, French Week appeal exhibition, Town Hall\n1917, Australian Art Association fifth annual exhibition\n1918, Group exhibition (with Dora Wilson and May Roxburgh), Fine Art Society\n1919, French aid exhibition, Fine Art Galleries\n1919, Twenty Melbourne Painters Society, Athenaeum Gallery\n1919, Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors annual exhibition, Victoria Markets\n1920, Twenty Melbourne Painters Society, Athenaeum Hall\n1940, Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors annual exhibition, Athenaeum Gallery\n1941, Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors annual exhibition, Athenaeum Gallery\n1950, Memorial exhibition for Ruth Sutherland, Melbourne Book Club Gallery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nimages of Ruth Sutherland's paintings on MutualArt\nBiographical cuttings on Ruth Sutherland, National Library of Australia\nRuth Sutherland: Australian art and artists file, State Library Victoria\nAustralian feminist art timeline lists exhibitions, artists, artworks and milestones that have contributed to discussion and development of feminist art in Australia.

She eventually left Paris to live in other parts of France, Italy, Spain, and Tahiti.\nIn 1938 Mercer returned to Australia, settling in Melbourne. There she associated with George Bell, William Frater, Lina Bryans and Arnold Shore. She also renewed her friendship with Janet Cumbrae Stewart, who she previously met in Paris in the 1920s. While in Melbourne, Mercer took art classes from George Bell and later taught at her private studio, where her students included Colin McCahon, Cumbrae Stewart and Lina Bryans.\nIn the 1940s Mercer exhibited at the Contemporary Art Society in Melbourne.\nIn 1953, Mercer returned to France and died there on 14 August 1963.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn 2017-2018 Mercer was included in the Australian National Trust show Intrepid Women – Australian women artists in Paris 1900-1950.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nimages of Mary Cockburn Mercer's work at the National Gallery of Victoria\nSandra Leveson (born 1944), also known as Sandra Leveson-Meares, is an Australian painter, printmaker, and teacher.\n\n\n== Training ==\nFrom 1959, aged fourteen, to 1963, Leveson studied design at Caulfield Institute of Technology where she and sculptor Ken Leveson met while he was taking fashion illustration.  She continued studies at the National Gallery School 1959-63 and they married in 1966 and lived in Sandringham and both taught at Brighton Technical College. In 1971 they were contemplating buying nineteenth-century mill near Castlemaine \"for another environment to work in,\" but instead converted a warehouse to a studio-cum-townhouse at 4 Tyrone Street, South Yarra. She undertook overseas study in the UK and US in 1974 and 1976.\n\n\n== Career and reception ==\n\n\n=== Teacher ===\nWhile resident at 23 Tennyson Street, Sandringham, where she was photographed in 1970 by Paul Cox (lecturer at Prahran College) with her then husband Ken, Leveson taught printmaking at Brighton Technical College. From 1970 to 1982 she lectured in Fine Art at the Prahran College of Advanced Education where she was Head of printmaking 1972–82. In Sydney, Prahran College graduate Carol Jerrems made a sequence of photographs of her in 1974 for A Book About Australia Women.\n\n\n=== Artist ===\nIn the late mid-1960s Leveson adopted a geometric Op Art style in her early screen prints. Of these reviewer Patrick McCaughey wrote:\nGood design wins out too often. These prints may contain intricacies but never real difficulties for the spectator. They do too much and make life much too easy with their bland matt colors. Pleasant enough and skilful in their decorative organisatiton, it's a pressure free art, demanding little and sustaining little. The exhibition, one suspects, hides a better artist than it reveals. The shaped polyptych upstairs promises a curtness awaiting future delivery.Later works established her as a colourist when in 1968 they were shown at Pinacotheca Gallery, Melbourne, in a joint show Recent prints 18 – 29 November with Alan Warren. However, despite their adherence to the high Modernist colour field style and to geometric abstraction then ascendant, as Foster points out, Leveson's work, and Lesley Dumbrell's likewise, was not included amongst the predominantly male artists' in the 1968 The Field survey.\nIn 1971 Leveson started screen printing on her canvases. Ruth Faerber in 1972 confirmed the lyrical quality of her imagery;Sandra Leveson uses an optical off-register dot pattern to create moire patterned surfaces in lyrical romantic color. Built up with a minute pointilistic technique, large silkscreen prints in editions, single canvases and double-sided glass images conjure up drifting recangular and diamond forms, structured by strongly contrasting stable and strict borders of flat color. Skill and sensitivity are superbly combined in works of restful elegance.That emphasis led her American Abstract Expressionist-influenced works of the 1970s, and first seen in Sydney in 1972 at The Holdsworth Galleries, which in turn was adapted to her semi-abstract representation of expansive Australian landscape.\nHowever McCaughey continued to regard Leveson's work of this period, shown at Realties at the end of 1972, as lightweight;They make all the right moves for seriousness. I mean they've got \"color spread\", \"optical displacement\" and even some cautious shaped prints. But we've all been dragged round this track too often for the moves to come off. There's not a twitch we can't predict, except one's own aghast grimace.Daniel Thomas pointed out in her 1974 show at Bonython the link between Leveson's screen printing, through the use of stencils, with her painting, describing the effect in her \"Optic Series\" as \"like looking at a pale Rothko through a flyscreen.\"  Thomas noted that she was then selling works at around $1,000. Leveson in interview said the effect was inspired on her overseas residencies during which she took photographs of mist and fog, \"s\nPegg Clarke (c. 1890 – 1959) was an Australian professional fashion, portrait, architectural and society photographer whose work, published frequently in magazines, was referred to by historian Jack Cato as being of \"the highest standard.\"\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nLittle is known of Pegg Clarke's early years, place or exact date of birth, or of what attracted her to photography. Joan Kerr has her death only as an estimate; \"between 1956 and 1958,\" while a 2009 exhibition sets it at 1959. Pegg Clarke claimed to be some seven years younger than Dora L Wilson, her lifelong companion, who was born in 1883. Dr. Jim Mitchell, archivist of Scotch College has proposed that she was related to Olive Clarke, secretary to Dr Colin Gilray, the college principal, from 1934 to 1953.\n\n\n== Career ==\nClarke had an early win with a picture Minnie in the October 1915 Australasian photo-review Home Portraiture Competition.\nRosebank from which she was operating before 1923 was row of terraces in Hawthorn that took its name from a 19th-century estate from which their land was subdivided. Her work featured in prominent early 20th century Australian magazines, at first in thumbnail portraits for The Bulletin. While the Australian quarterly The Home launched by Ure Smith in 1920, nominated Harold Cazneaux (1878–1953) as their \"Special Photographer\", Pegg Clarke, probably 8 to 12 years his younger was accorded bylines in almost every issue from its inception for photographs of stately homes and portraits of artists, and performers. During the interwar period, Clarke's clientele included rich and prominent Melbourne society figures at Government House and Flemington race track of Lady Stradbroke (wife of the Governor of Victoria), Dame Margaret Davidson (wife of the Governor of NSW), and Lady Allardyce (wife of the Governor of Tasmania).\nHer main rival, Ruth Hollick, award-winning society photographer who exhibited in Australia and internationally, and one of Australia's most successful professional photographers soon became a friend. With her professional and life partner Dorothy Izard, Hollick met the painter Dora Wilson and her lifelong companion Pegg Clarke (the pair were soon to share a studio), and together the two close couples forged a strong personal friendship. A 1937 article in The Australian Home Beautiful makes clear that despite their lasting relationship their tastes differed, with Wilson favouring period-style decor for their studio and Clarke, the modernist furnishings.\n\nBy the end of WW1 Clarke, along with her friend Hollick, were considered the leading photographers in Melbourne. Both were respected for their fashion photography, their high society portraits, especially of debutantes and brides, and their portraits of visiting celebrities such those by Clarke of actress Joan Rowell, wives of diplomats and composer/musician Margaret Sutherland. Amongst Clarke's more famous friends, and subjects of her portraits were Australian poet Dorothea Mackellar, and Dame Sybil Thorndike The Australian Gallery Directors' Council notes that, \"[t]he role of Cazneaux covering home and social photographs for magazine in Sydney was shared by Hollick and Clarke in Melbourne.\"  Hollick specialised in fashion photography and Clarke in interiors and architecture. She also provided photographic reproductions of her friend Dora Wilson's paintings to the press.\nFrom 1923 Clarke started to advertise her services with mention of her inclusions in \"The London Salon 1921\" and \"The Pittsburgh Salon 1922\", and shifted with Wilson to an upstairs studio which they shared in Linden Hall, a block of luxury flats at 403 Glenferrie Road, Malvern, then from 1927-1940s, relocated to a studio she designed at 476 Glenferrie Road, Hawthorn, opposite the private school Scotch College, the clientele and grounds of which she photographed.\n\n\n=== Europe ===\n\nNewspapers' social columns covered the couple's activities regularly, and the farewell parties when in April 1927 they readied to d\nJohn Mather (1848 – 18 February 1916) was a Scottish-Australian plein-air painter and etcher.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMather was born in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, son of John Mather, a surveyor, and his wife Margaret, née Allan. Mather worked as a house decorator.\nMather studied art at the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts and migrated to Australia in 1878. He was married in 1882 to Miss Jessie Pines Best, a daughter of Captain James Best, a pilot of Hobson's Bay. Together they had one daughter and three sons; Margaret Playfair, John Allan, Louis Melville (died in infancy), and Leslie Frank Strand (died in 1919).\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1880, Mather was partly responsible for the decoration of the dome of the Royal Exhibition Building, Melbourne. He joined the bohemian Buonarotti Club, camping with other members on plein-air painting expeditions, and from 1886 served, with Frederick McCubbin, Louis Abrahams and Jane Sutherland, on its exhibition selection committee established by Tom Roberts. In 1892 he was appointed to the board of trustees of the Public Library, Museums and National Gallery of Victoria, then was a founding member of the Victorian Artists' Society, and its president in 1893–1900, 1906–1908 and 1911. Mather was a member of the Felton Bequest Committee from 1905 to 1916 and as trustee, strongly supported Australian art.\nAs a painter, Mather was also involved in the bohemian Artists' Camps of Sydney. In 1912 along with Frederick McCubbin, Max Meldrum, Walter Withers Mather formed the breakaway Australian Art Association.\nThree of Mather's own paintings, Autumn in the Fitzroy Gardens in oils, and Morning, Lake Omeo and Wintry Weather, Yarra Glen, both watercolours, were purchased by the National Gallery of Victoria.\n\n\n== Residences, Studios and other Addresses ==\nMather had a number of homes, studios and other addresses throughout his career, including:\n\n\n== Students ==\nMr John Mather is reported to have, had a wide celebrity as a teacher, and ... there are artists of repute in Melbourne now who commenced their careers in his Austral School in Collins Street.

She was a founding member of the Australian Tonalist movement and part of the Twenty Melbourne Painters Society.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDescribed in a 2009 review by Sasha Grishin as “a South Australian Meldrumite who has been almost totally forgotten,” Mary 'Polly' Hurry in fact was born in Kyneton, Victoria, on 2 May, 1883, daughter of Henry Hurry and Mary Herring and the middle child of two siblings, Maurice and George. She spent her early years there at the family home South Lodge, 29 Donnithorne Street, then was educated at Ruyton Girls' School, Kew.\n\n\n== Training ==\nLater, at the Kyneton School of Mines, Hurry took lessons in drawing and wood carving, then studied watercolour painting with the Scottish-born artist, John Mather. During a camping holiday she met several artists, who like Mather were associates of the tonalist Max Meldrum, and decided to take up art seriously. She began drawing from life at Melbourne's 1859 Old Temple Court building where studios were occupied by students of Frederick McCubbin; Jessie Traill, Dora Wilson, Janet Cumbrae Stewart, Norah Gurdon and AME Bale; before approaching Meldrum to join his studio as one of the first of his pupils, alongside Harry McClelland.\n\n\n== Australian tonalist artist ==\nHurry regarded Meldrum as the most important influence on her artistic development, but the association also shaped her personal life; in Meldrum’s studio she met John Farmer whom she married on 13 August 1921. Farmer (1897-1989) was a close friend of fellow student 10 years younger, Justus Jorgensen, when both attended the National Gallery School in 1914, where he also met Clarice Beckett and Colin Colahan. Brought up in a large family in Brunswick, Farmer worked as a scenery painter for J.C. Williamson Ltd. Richard McCullin, a drawing master at the Gallery School, suggested that students might be interested in going to hear a lecture in 1917 by controversial young painter, Max Meldrum, who argued that \"the art of painting is a pure science - the science of optical analysis.\"\n\nHurry became a founding member of the original Twenty Melbourne Painters Society — Jas Stuart Anderson, Alice Bale, Elsie Barlow, Alexander Colquhoun, George Colville, Edith Downing, Bernice Edwell, William Frater, Henrietta Maria Gulliver, Carl Hampel, C.E. James, Richard McCann, Bertha Merfield, A.E. Newbury, Clara Southern, Ruth Sutherland, Jo Sweatman,  Isobel Tweddle, and Rose A. Walker  — all supporters and students of Meldrum, which split from The Victorian Artists Society in protest at his defeat in the 1918 election for its president. In 1919, the breakaway group held their first exhibition. Twenty Melbourne Painters Society founding Secretary A.M.E. Bale declared:“We desire nothing but sincerity and a humble study of nature, from which alone all art, whether decorative or realistic, draws any enduring life.”\nAlso in 1921, Hurry entered the inaugural Archibald Prize, in which 41 works were submitted and all exhibited from 17 January 1922 for two months. The Prize was awarded to WB McInnes, but no catalogue for the 1921 exhibition has been found, and the subject of the work submitted by Hurry is not known. \nThe couple shared one of the purpose-built studios (Studio 2) at the 1888 Grosvenor Chambers, 9 Collins Street, Melbourne (its name a direct reference to Grosvenor Gallery of London) occupied also at various times by Meldrum, Tom Roberts, Frederick McCubbin, Arthur Streeton, Percival Ball, Charles Francis Summers, Clara Southern, Jane Sutherland, Charles Conder, E. Phillips Fox, John Longstaff, Girolamo Nerli, Louis Abrahams, Rose Walker, George Lambert, and Ola Cohn. Frequent visitors to the studio were Janet Cumbrae Stewart, Norah Gurdon, Dora L. Wilson (who also had a studio in the building), Jessie Traill, Norah Wilkie and Margaret Pestell.\n\n\n== Asia ==\nFor their honeymoon the Farmers left via Hong Kong for China, visiting Sha\nJessie Constance Alicia Traill (29 July 1881 – 15 May 1967) was an Australian printmaker. Trained by Frederick McCubbin at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School, and by painter and printmaker Frank Brangwyn in London, Traill worked in England and France in the period immediately preceding World War I. During the war she served in hospitals with the Voluntary Aid Detachment.\nTraill is best known for a series of prints created in the early 1930s depicting the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Critic and art historian Sasha Grishin describes her as \"one of the great Australian artists of the 20th century\".\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nJessie Traill was born in Brighton, Victoria, on 29 July 1881. Her father was Scotland-born George Hamilton Traill, who had administered a vanilla plantation in the Seychelles, before becoming a bank manager in Victoria; her mother Jessie Neilley was Tasmanian.\nTraill was one of four daughters of George and Jessie, all of them educated at a boarding school in Switzerland, where they learned French and German. The family were deeply religious Anglicans; two of Traill's sisters would later join religious orders, while Margaret would become a carver.\nReturning to Australia, Traill in 1900 studied under John Mather (artist) at his Austral Art School.  In 1903 she kept a notebook of her lessons commenting on the etchings within it as they progress through various states. The notebook details her active engagement in the print making process and the tuition of John Mather. Together with jottings of sales, news clippings and a congratulatory letter from John Mather, her early success with the medium is documented. \nJessie Traill also studied at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School from 1902 to 1906, where she was taught by a leading member of the Heidelberg School, Frederick McCubbin. Her fellow students were mostly women and included Hilda Rix Nicholas, Norah Gurdon, Ruth Sutherland, Dora Wilson, and Vida Lahey. In March 1906, Traill and her sister Minna, together with her father, sailed for England, while her two older sisters, Kathleen and Elsie, remained in Victoria. George died while they were travelling in 1907, and is buried in Rome.\nTraill studied in London under Anglo-Welsh painter and printmaker Frank Brangwyn, as well as taking classes in summer with him, in Belgium and the Netherlands. She was the most accomplished student from Australia that he taught.\n\n\n== Early career, 1908 to 1931 ==\nTraill's first notable successes were in 1909, when works by the artist were hung at the Paris Salon and London's Royal Academy of Arts, while her first solo show was opened in Melbourne. She was successful again in 1914 with work hung at the Royal Academy.\nWhen war broke out in 1914 Traill, like fellow artist Iso Rae, joined the Voluntary Aid Detachment. She worked in hospitals, including at a convalescent facility in Roehampton in May 1915, then later in a military hospital in Rouen. Traill and Rae became the only Australian women artists to portray the war while in France. When in 1918 Australia first appointed official war artists, sixteen men were chosen; Traill was not included.\nBack in Australia, Traill in 1921 became a member of the Australian Painter-Etchers' Society, and entered its exhibitions. Her works from this period reflected her interest in both Art Nouveau and in the woodblock printing of Japan.\n\n\n== Sydney Harbour Bridge series ==\nWhen the Australian Painter-Etchers Society in 1932 held its only thematic exhibition, Sydney Harbour Bridge Celebrations, Traill contributed a series of seven prints. The works comprised six etchings completed across the period 1927 to 1931, and a coloured aquatint created after construction was finished in 1932. These have become Traill's best known and most highly regarded images. At the time they were created, the artist Arthur Streeton observed: Melbourne should be proud of that fine draughtswoman and etcher Miss Jessie Traill. By incessant labour \nThe Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, established in Melbourne, Victoria in 1902, is the oldest surviving women's art group in Australia.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors (MSWPS) began in 1902 as a monthly gathering of eight former students of Frederick McCubbin from the National Gallery School which members called the Students' Art Club. It is known that among these founders were Daisy Stone, Tina Gowdie, Annie Gates, Kate Allan, Ella Thorn, Henrietta Maria Gulliver and a Miss Stock (otherwise unidentified, who died in 1906). In 1905 they added the indigenous word  \"Woomballano\" (meaning either 'everlasting beauty' or 'search for beauty') to identify their Art Club, changing its title to The Women's Art Club in 1913 then to the Melbourne Society of Women Painters in 1930. The present designation was adopted in 1954.\nMany of its early members were plein air painters and identified with the Heidelberg School, which was regarded widely as a male group but which involved many women. The interest in the decorative arts at the opening of the twentieth century attracted other members who were significant craftspeople. By the 1920s, the Society was assimilating the generation of professional women artists emerging from the Melbourne National Gallery School, with significant women artists, representatives of both the Meldrum tonal school and modernism, being invited to join. The Society was less overtly feminist than its Sydney counterpart The  Society of Women Painters (later named Women’s Industrial Arts Society) which was founded in 1910 in reaction to the discrimination of male-dominated juries of art institutions and societies.  During the Second World War the MSWPS opened volunteer headquarters at Grosvenor Chambers (9 Collins Street, Melbourne) where they made and sold handcrafts and art to raise money for the war effort.\nMSWPS has met at heritage-listed Ola Cohn House 41-43 Gipps Street, East Melbourne since the sculptor's death in 1964. She was President of the Society from 1948 to 1964.\n\n\n== Notable members ==\nMelbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors members included:\n\nCristina Asquith Baker, painter, print-maker (1868–1960)\nAlice Marian Ellen Bale (1875–1955), Studied at National Gallery School 1895–1904, from 1917 to 1955 a consistent exhibitor with the Women’s Art Club \nMargaret Francis Ellen Baskerville sculptor (1861–1930)\nClarice Beckett (1887–1935) participated in Women’s Art Club shows until the early 1930s.\nLina Bryans (1909–2000), exhibited 1940–1965 and prominent in the 1960s, resigned 1966, rejoined 1991—.

It was created in 1796 for John Stuart, 4th Earl of Bute.\n\n\n== Family history ==\nJohn Stuart was the member of a family that descended from John Stewart (1360–1449), Sheriff of Bute, a natural son of Robert II of Scotland and his mistress Moira Leitch, married to Janet Sympil and in 1407 to Elizabeth Graham. This John Stewart was granted the lands of Bute, Arran and Cumbrae by his father. He was known as the 'Black Stewart' because of his dark complexion; his brother John Stewart of Dundonald was known as the 'Red Stewart'. The grant of lands was confirmed in 1400 by a charter of Robert III.\nAbout 1385, John Stewart of Bute was granted the hereditary office of Sheriff of Bute by his father Robert II. He died in 1449, aged 89. At about the time of Mary, Queen of Scots, the family adopted the spelling of 'Stuart', which she had used while living in France. James Stuart, seventh in descent from the Black Stewart, was created a Baronet, of Bute, in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 28 March 1627. His grandson, the third Baronet, represented Bute in the Parliament of Scotland and was one of the Commissioners that negotiated the Union between Scotland and England. On 14 April 1703, he was raised to the Peerage of Scotland as Earl of Bute, Viscount of Kingarth, and Lord Mount Stuart, Cumra and Inchmarnock. He was succeeded by his son, the 2nd Earl of Bute and 4th Baronet, who sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Buteshire. On his early death, the titles passed to his son, the third Earl. He became a politician and favourite of George III and served as Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1762 to 1763. Lord Bute married Mary, a daughter of Edward Wortley Montagu and his wife the writer Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. In 1761, Lord Bute's wife Mary was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain in her own right as Baroness Mount Stuart, of Wortley in the County of York, with remainder to the heirs male of her body by her then husband Lord Bute. Her son became the first Marquess of Bute, whose eldest son and heir John Stuart, Lord Mount Stuart (who predeceased his father) married Lady Elizabeth Penelope, daughter and heiress of Patrick McDouall-Crichton, 6th Earl of Dumfries. Lord Mount Stuart's eldest son John succeeded his maternal grandfather as seventh Earl of Dumfries in 1803, and his paternal grandfather as second Marquess of Bute in 1814. In 1805, he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Crichton before Stuart. He was succeeded by his only child, the third Marquess. He was an antiquarian, scholar, philanthropist and architectural patron and also held the post of Lord-Lieutenant of Buteshire. It was the 3rd Marquess who in 1868 first converted to Catholicism, since which time the family have remained of that faith. His son the fourth Marquess was also Lord-Lieutenant of Buteshire. His grandson, John Crichton-Stuart, 6th Marquess of Bute, succeeded his father and was Lord-Lieutenant of Buteshire from 1967 to 1975. As of 2021, the peerages are held by the latter's grandson, John Crichton-Stuart, 8th Marquess of Bute.\n\n\n=== Bute family titles ===\nThe Marquesses of Bute have important ancestors not only in Scotland but also in Wales, including the first Lord Herbert of Cardiff, son and heir of Richard Herbert of Ewyas. He was also created Earl of Pembroke. After the  Stuart Restoration, most of the Herbert family property was sold, and the rest was owned by Thomas, Viscount Windsor, who married Charlotte, the only child of Philip Herbert, 7th Earl of Pembroke. In 1766, Viscount Windsor's granddaughter, Charlotte Jane, was married to John Stuart, Lord Mount Stuart (1744-1814), the son and heir of the 3rd Earl of Bute, prime minister from 1762 to 1763, and through this marriage great estates in south Wales came into the Bute family. In 1776, sixteen years b\nDora Lynnell Wilson (31 August 1883 – 21 November 1946) was a British-born Australian artist, best known in her adopted country of Australia for her etchings and street scenes.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDora Lynnell Wilson was born on 31 August 1883 in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Her parents were James Wilson, agent, and Annie Maria, née Green. The family emigrated to the state of Victoria in Australia in 1884, when Dora was a year old.\n\n\n== Education ==\nWilson was educated at Somerset School and Methodist Ladies' College in Melbourne. From 1901–1906 she studied at the National Gallery under Bernard Hall and Frederick McCubbin, forming friendships with fellow artists Ruth Hollick, Gwendolyn Grant, Norah Gurdon, and her partner Pegg Clarke. She also took lessons from John Mather with Jessie Traill and Janie Wilkinson Whyte.\n\n\n== Artistic career ==\nWilson was best known for her etchings, pastels and oils of still lifes and nudes. Her work was praised for her 'strong sense of colour' but also critiqued for demonstrating a 'chocolate box prettiness'.\nHer work was included in a number of notable exhibitions, including the five week Australian Exhibition of Women's Work in Melbourne, a Royal Academy exhibition of Australian art in London. In 1923 her work, 'Reve d'Or', was reproduced on the cover of Women's World and exhibited at the Société des Artistes Français in Paris.\nHer studio at Collins Street West was the meeting place of ex–Gallery School students who exhibited in 1913–14 as 'The Twelve Melbourne Painters.' This group included Jessie Traill, Janet Cumbrae Stewart, Norah Gurdon, Penleigh Boyd, and Lindsay Bernard Hall. Wilson was also a member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors.\nFrom the 1920s onwards she concentrated largely on street scenes, and in  1923 she was commissioned by Sir Baldwin Spencer to undertake a series of paintings of European landmarks, which saw her travelling around Europe for over two years, accompanied by the photographer Pegg Clarke. In 1928 these works were exhibited at the Beaux Arts Gallery, London, and the following year at Australia House. In the early 1930s she focused on historical scenes from Melbourne's history, with an exhibition entitled 'Milestones of Melbourne' held at the Fine Art Society Gallery in March 1935. Her work was received favorably by Arthur Streeton for being \"fresh in colour and treatment and free from the depressing appearance of black paint.\" In 1937 she joined and exhibited with Robert Menzies' Australian Academy of Art.\n\n\tDora L Wilson, Pictures Collection, State Library Victoria\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Death ==\nWilson died of cancer on 21 November 1946 and was cremated at Springvale Cemetery, Melbourne.

After serving as a private house it became a school and most recently (2015) has passed into the ownership of the Beith Development Community Trust.\n\n\n== History ==\nGeilsland was a half merk land, part of the 4 merk land of Marshalland of old extent, in the Barony of Braidstone. An earlier name is said to have been 'Neilsland'. The name is pronounced 'Jillsland' locally. The origin of the name may refer to a gil or gyll, referring to a cleft or ravine as found at the 'Fairy Glen' where the Powgree Burn cuts through the fields.\nThe lands of Geilsland were bounded to the south and west by the lands held by James Kerr; by the Lands of Crummock held by Fanny Brown; by the lands of Little Hill of Beith once held by John Shedden and then by Alexander Aitkenhead and finally by the road from Beith to Broadstone.\n\n\n=== Owners ===\nIn 1672 the lands were held by John Anderson of Cruckhills whose wife was Janet Barclay. Thomas had inherited by 1697 and then James Anderson. The lands of Cruckhills (near Balgray and Hessilhead) separately passed into the ownership of Hugh Wilson Robert Pollock purchased the lands of Geilsland in 1761 and by 1767 the Crawford family had obtained title with Thomas and John holding the lands prior to William Fulton Love's acquisition in 1867.\n\nOn 7 June 1902 the local paper reported The purchaser of Geilsland is Mr Warren, wine and spirit merchant, Glasgow, who is a brother of Mr Warren, of the firm Warren and Stewart, engineers, who have had control of the various local schemes in connection with water and drainage for a number of years back. Thomas, John and Timothy Warren inherited in turn before an insurance manager, Robert James Cecil Govan and his wife Jean Kinniburgh Templeton purchased the property in around 1923.\nIn 1942 a builder, Charles Scott Gray purchased Geilsland for £1750, followed by Norman Dunlop McCombe family who were involved in the fruit trade. The Church of Scotland then obtained and used the house, chapel, gymnasium and dormitory blocks from 1963 as a special school until closure of the facility in 2015 and its sale to the Beith Development Community Trust Ltd. later that year.\n\n\n=== Geilsland House and grounds ===\nGeilsland was sold in four lots and in 1867 two of these lots were purchased by Wiliam Fulton Love, writer and bank agent in Beith. He built a handsome villa and gatehouse, in the domestic Gothic style, and enclosed and planted  5 acres (20,000 m2) around the villa. The Millport Chapel, situated within the grounds, was fitted out with items from an old church that once stood on the Isle of Cumbrae.\n\nGeilsland House may have been designed by Robert Samson Ingram (1841-1915) of J & R S Ingram, Kilmarnock. A pair of late 19th-century Gothic semi-villas at 28 and 30 Portland Road, Kilmarnock are believed to be by Ingram and clearly possess architectural details comparable with Geilsland, in particular the entrance porch with its columned supports.\nThe McCombe family were the last owners before it became a Church of Scotland school and being involved in the fruit trade they built greenhouses, a walled garden, and fruit packing sheds. A Summer House existed in the grounds at this time, extensively used by Mr McCombe who suffered from ill health.\nIn 1963 the property came to 13 196/1000 Acres of grounds.\nLomond House within the grounds was built in a mock Gothic style in 1999 as a unit for young people with special needs.\n\n\n== Geilsland School ==\nThe Church of Scotland established a Special School at Geilsand in 1964, the opening date being 1 July that year. Sixty boys was set as the original intake maximum and the first major task was for the staff and pupils to convert or build the necessary buildings. The sports hall was also largely constructed by the staff and pupils.\nThe first headteacher was Mr. A. L. 'Sandy' Munro. To commemorate the millennium and the work of the scho\nInverkip (; Scottish Gaelic: Inbhir Chip) is a village and parish in the Inverclyde council area and historic county of Renfrewshire in the west central Lowlands of Scotland, 5 miles (8 km) southwest of Greenock and 8.1 miles (13 km) north of Largs on the A78 trunk road. The village takes its name from the River Kip and is served by Inverkip railway station.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nIn 1170 Baldwin de Bigres, Sheriff of Lanark, granted a stretch of land to the monks of Paisley Abbey. This land was described as \"The pennyland between the rivulets Kip and Daff\". Pennyland is an old Scots word of Norse origin which is used to describe a small piece of land, the rent for which is one penny per year.\nThe area granted to the monks in 1170 equates to much of the north section of today's village, from the bridge over the Daff on Main Street, near Inverkip Hotel to the old bridge over the River Kip at Bridgend Cottages. Extending to the coast at the old bridge at Kip Marina and probably as far inland as the railway line.\nInverkip was made a burgh of barony before the Act of Union in 1707, with the parish containing all of Gourock, Wemyss Bay, Skelmorlie and part of Greenock.\n\n\n=== Inverkip Church ===\n\nBy 1188, the monks had built a church on the site of the present old graveyard, at what is now the junction of Langhouse Road and Millhouse Road. This small church (known as Auld Kirk) served the entire Christian population between Kilmacolm and Largs for around 400 years. The existing (derelict) mausoleum of the Shaw-Stewarts stands on the site of the original church and incorporates some of its structure. The Christians of Greenock presented a petition to the Crown for a Church of their own. This resulted in the opening of the Old West Kirk in Greenock in 1859 and brought to an end the regular six mile each way treks by Sunday worshipers from Greenock to Inverkip. A journey which must have been very demanding, given the terrain and the absence of proper roads during that period.\nThe present church building on Langhouse Road was completed in 1805, reputedly to a plan by the civil engineer Thomas Telford, but there is no evidence to support this and the design of Inverkip Church is quite different from the known 'Telford Kirks' which were built during the same period. The church building is described by Historic Environment Scotland as  \"2-storey type; simple Renaissance with upper windows round-headed; open belfry at front gable; (1804-5). Clock on pediment several of windows blocked up, but fenestration pattern kept in black & white\".\nThe church hall and manse were built during the 1960s and stand across Langhouse Road from the church itself. The old manse (now known as Kirkbrae house) is also on Langhouse Road, between the original and present churches. It was built in 1730 and is now a private residence.\n\n\n=== Ardgowan ===\n\nBy the 13th century, a castle had been built at what is now Ardgowan House. This early castle changed hands between the Scots and the English during the Wars of Independence. Robert The Bruce fought here for both sides during this period. The land was acquired by the Stewarts in 1390 and they built the existing castle during the 15th century. Contained in the gardens of Ardgowan House and away from the public eye, it consists of a three-storey square keep with a garret. The main entrance is at first floor level and is accessed by an external stairway. The castle was abandoned as a residence when Ardgowan House was built by the Shaw-Stewarts in 1799–1801. Following construction of Ardgowan House, the first proper road to Greenock was constructed by Sir John Shaw Stewart and opened in 1803.\nArdgowan House served as a military hospital during both world wars and has the distinction of being the first Scottish military hospital to be damaged by German bombs. The damage was slight and no casualties were recorded, but many windows at the house were smashed.\n\n\n=== Witchcraft & Witch Hunts ===\nInverkip was a hotbe\nThe South-West Districts Championships  was a combined men's and women's grass court tennis tournament founded in 1950. The tournament was played at the Warrnambool Lawn Tennis Club, Warrnambool, Victoria, Australia, and ran annually until 1979 when it was discontinued as part of the ILTF Independent Circuit.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn March 1950 the first South Western Districts Championships were founded. The winner of the men's singles title was Ken McGregor. The winner of the women's singles event was won by Joy Strickland. The event was played annually on outdoor grass courts at the Warrnambool Lawn Tennis Club, Warrnambool, Victoria, Australia throughout its run. It initially ran annually as part of the ILTF Australasia Circuit, a global regional sub circuit of the larger ILTF World Circuit until 1969 for men, then 1972 for women before it then became part of the ILTF Independent Circuit (those events not part of the men's ILTF Grand Prix Circuit or women's Virginia Slims Circuit until 1979 when it was downgraded from that tour.\nToday the venue for these former championships being the Warrnambool Tennis Club is one of the largest tennis facilities in Australia.

Each member of the Royal Family who undertakes public duties has their own separate household.\nWhen Elizabeth II was still a Princess she married Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on 20 November 1947. After that marriage they shared the Household of the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh.\nWhen she succeeded her father George VI as sovereign of the United Kingdom, she appointed a new household, known as the Household of the Sovereign 1952–2022.\nThe Duke of Edinburgh then received a separate household upon his wife's accession, the Household of the Duke of Edinburgh until his death in 2021.\nWith the passing of the Queen on 8 September 2022 the Household of the Sovereign passed to her son, King Charles III.\n\n\n== Great officers of the Household ==\n\n\n=== Lord Chamberlain ===\nThe Lord Chamberlain of the Household is the highest-ranking official of the Royal Household of the United Kingdom, overseeing the departments that support and provide advice to the Sovereign of the United Kingdom, while also acting as the main channel of communication between the Sovereign and the House of Lords.\n\n\n=== Vice Chamberlain ===\nThe Vice-Chamberlain of the Household is usually a junior government whip in the British House of Commons and is the Deputy to the Lord Chamberlain. The Vice Chamberlain's main duties are to compile a daily private report for the Sovereign on the proceedings in the House of Commons and to transmit addresses from the Commons to the Sovereign and vice versa.\n\n\n=== Lord Steward ===\nThe Lord Steward of the Household manages the Treasurer of the Household and Comptroller of the Household, who rank next to him. The appointee is always a peer, and is the first dignitary of the court.\n\n\n=== Treasurer of the Household ===\nThe Treasurer of the Household is usually held by one of the government deputy Chief Whips in the House of Commons. The Treasurer is automatically a member of the privy council.\n\n\n=== Comptroller of the Household ===\nThe Comptroller of the Household is nominally the second-ranking member of the Lord Steward's department after the Treasurer of the Household. In recent times, a senior government whip has invariably occupied the office. On state occasions the Comptroller, in common with certain other senior officers of the Household, carries a white staff of office, as often seen in portraits.\n\n\n=== Master of the Horse ===\n\nThe Master of the Horse is the third dignitary of the court. It is a primarily ceremonial office, and rarely appears except on state occasions, and especially when the Sovereign is mounted. There are still several pages of honour who are nominally in the master of the horse's department. They are youths aged from twelve to sixteen, selected by the sovereign in person, to attend on him at state ceremonies.\n\n\n== Private Secretary's Office ==\n\n\n=== Private Secretary to the Sovereign ===\n5 August 1952: The Right Honourable Sir Alan Frederick Lascelles, GCVO, KCB, CMG, MC\n\n\n==== Assistant Private Secretaries ====\n5 August 1952: Major Sir Michael Edward Adeane, KCVO, CB\n5 August 1952: Major Edward William Spencer Ford, CB, MVO\n5 August 1952: Lieutenant-Colonel the Honourable Martin Michael Charles Wemyss Charteris, OBE\n\n\n=== Press Secretary ===\n5 August 1952: Commander (S) Richard Colville, MVO, DSC, RN\n\n\n== Privy Purse and Treasurer's Office ==\n\n\n=== Keeper of the Privy Purse and Treasurer to The Queen ===\n5 August 1952: The Right Honourable Sir James Ulick Francis Canning Alexander, GCVO, KCB, CMG, OBE\n\n\n==== Deputy Treasurer to The Queen and Secretary of the Privy Purse ====\n5 August 1952: Commander (S) Sir Dudley Colles, KCVO, OBE, RN\n\n\n==== Assistant Keeper of the Privy Purse ====\n5 August 1952: Brigadier The Right Honourable Charles George Vivian, Baron Tryon, DSO\n\n\n=== Almonry ===\n\n\n==== High Almoner ====\n5 August 1952: Th\nThe National Gallery of Victoria Art School, associated with the National Gallery of Victoria, was a private fine arts college founded in 1867 and was Australia's leading art school of 50 years.\nIt is also referred to as the 'National Gallery School' ‘National Gallery Art School’, ‘National Gallery School of Art’ and ‘Victorian National Gallery School of Art’. Official correspondence commencing from the 1950s is headed ‘National Gallery of Victoria Art School’ and in McCulloch’s Encyclopedia of Australian Art, it is abbreviated 'NGC School'.\nIt was the leading centre for academic art training in Australia until about 1910. Among its luminaries, the school was headed by  Sir William Dargie in 1946–53, John Brack from 1962–68, and Lenton Parr from 1968 to its absorption into the newly created Victorian College of the Arts.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe State Library of Victoria, a public library, opened in Melbourne in 1859, and from 1861 it housed a Museum of Art and a Picture Gallery, opened in 1864, both situated alongside the Public Library on Swanston Street between LaTrobe and Russell Streets. Its art collection was named the National Gallery of Victoria in 1869.\nAt the suggestion of Thomas Clark, who was to become teacher of drawing, a National Gallery Art School, School of Design was formed and started enrolling students in June 1867, then was divided into two schools in 1870. Eugene von Guerard, then 60 years old, was appointed Instructor of Painting and Master of the School of Art. Thomas Clark was appointed Instructor and Master of the School of Design which prepared students for the School of Painting, a separate institution. In 1887 the School of Design became the Drawing School. By the turn of the century, its teaching largely followed that of the Academies of Europe.\nStudents enrolling were required to demonstrate only rudimentary artistic skill and came from all over the country, paying a very reasonable ten shillings per term (a value of A$40–50 in 2022) in the 1920s. They commenced with drawing in charcoal from plaster casts, before proceeding to working from the nude model. The museum provided classes in natural history, and students benefitted from ready access to its art collections. Prizes were instituted in 1887 and gradually increased in number and value, the most desirable being the Traveling Scholarship which was later the Keith and Elisabeth Murdoch Travelling Fellowship.\nAfter World War II, ex- servicemen and women training under the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme (CRTS) were accommodated in a third department. By 1953 the School had reverted to a Drawing School and a Painting School. Among its alumni are counted many of the most prominent Australian artists.\n\n\n== Merger creating the Victorian College of the Arts ==\nThe National Gallery Art School ceased as an independent institution in 1973 when it became the foundation school of the Victorian College of the Arts (VCA) which became an affiliated college of the University of Melbourne in July 1991. On 1 January 1992 an Act of Parliament brought the components of former Prahran College, Victoria College's Prahran Campus and Prahran College of TAFE, under the auspices of Swinburne University of Technology, with the only tertiary courses, Graphics and Industrial Design, remaining on the campus, all others being moved to Deakin University. Prahran Fine Art under Gareth Sansom was relocated and amalgamated with the Victorian College of the Arts, where the next Dean of Art was William Kelly.\nAs the VCA was not already split into departments, it was the Prahran heads who were given such, newly created, roles in several cases; with Pam Hallandal becoming head of drawing (then retiring at the end of 1993); head of ceramics was Greg Wain, previously head of ceramics at Prahran;  Victor Majzner likewise became head of painting at the VCA; Prahran Graduate, Christopher Köller was head of their new department of Photography.

The Birthday Honours are awarded as part of the Queen's Official Birthday celebrations during the month of June. The Queen's Birthday Honours were announced on 6 June 2016 in New Zealand and 10 June in the United Kingdom.\nThe recipients of honours are displayed as they were styled before their new honour. They are arranged by the country (in order of precedence) whose ministers advised the Queen on the appointments, then by honour with grades, i.e. Knight/Dame Grand Cross, Knight/Dame Commander etc., and then by divisions, i.e. Civil, Diplomatic and Military as appropriate.\n\n\n== United Kingdom ==\nBelow are the individuals appointed by Elizabeth II in her right as Queen of the United Kingdom with honours within her own gift, and with the advice of the Government for other honours.\n\n\n=== Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) ===\nDame Vera Margaret Lynn, .

She was born Janet Agnes Stewart, the youngest of ten children born to Francis Edward Stewart (1833–1904) and Agnes Park (1843–1927). Janet's eldest brother, Francis William Sutton Stewart, became convinced of a family connection to the Stuarts of Bute and despite never proving the link, adopted \"Cumbrae\" to his name, and his siblings followed suit. This addition to the name would later serve a greater purpose for Janet, who quickly abandoned the hyphen and identified herself professionally as simply Cumbrae Stewart, and so avoided, to a certain extent, the limitations and scrutiny attached to her sex."

Ruth Faerber in 1972 confirmed the lyrical quality of her imagery;Sandra Leveson uses an optical off-register dot pattern to create moire patterned surfaces in lyrical romantic color. Built up with a minute pointilistic technique, large silkscreen prints in editions, single canvases and double-sided glass images conjure up drifting recangular and diamond forms, structured by strongly contrasting stable and strict borders of flat color. Skill and sensitivity are superbly combined in works of restful elegance.That emphasis led her American Abstract Expressionist-influenced works of the 1970s, and first seen in Sydney in 1972 at The Holdsworth Galleries, which in turn was adapted to her semi-abstract representation of expansive Australian landscape."

The existing (derelict) mausoleum of the Shaw-Stewarts stands on the site of the original church and incorporates some of its structure. The Christians of Greenock presented a petition to the Crown for a Church of their own. This resulted in the opening of the Old West Kirk in Greenock in 1859 and brought to an end the regular six mile each way treks by Sunday worshipers from Greenock to Inverkip.

The museum provided classes in natural history, and students benefitted from ready access to its art collections.

It is known that among these founders were Daisy Stone, Tina Gowdie, Annie Gates, Kate Allan, Ella Thorn, Henrietta Maria Gulliver and a Miss Stock (otherwise unidentified, who died in 1906). In 1905 they added the indigenous word  \"Woomballano\" (meaning either 'everlasting beauty' or 'search for beauty') to identify their Art Club, changing its title to The Women's Art Club in 1913 then to the Melbourne Society of Women Painters in 1930. The present designation was adopted in 1954.\nMany of its early members were plein air painters and identified with the Heidelberg School, which was regarded widely as a male group but which involved many women. The interest in the decorative arts at the opening of the twentieth century attracted other members who were significant craftspeople. By the 1920s, the Society was assimilating the generation of professional women artists emerging from the Melbourne National Gallery School, with significant women artists, representatives of both the Meldrum tonal school and modernism, being invited to join. The Society was less overtly feminist than its Sydney counterpart The  Society of Women Painters (later named Women’s Industrial Arts Society) which was founded in 1910 in reaction to the discrimination of male-dominated juries of art institutions and societies.  During the Second World War the MSWPS opened volunteer headquarters at Grosvenor Chambers (9 Collins Street, Melbourne) where they made and sold handcrafts and art to raise money for the war effort.\nMSWPS has met at heritage-listed Ola Cohn House 41-43 Gipps Street, East Melbourne since the sculptor's death in 1964. She was President of the Society from 1948 to 1964.\n\n\n== Notable members ==\nMelbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors members included:\n\nCristina Asquith Baker, painter, print-maker (1868–1960)\nAlice Marian Ellen Bale (1875–1955), Studied at National Gallery School 1895–1904, from 1917 to 1955 a consistent exhibitor with the Women’s Art Club \nMargaret Francis Ellen Baskerville sculptor (1861–1930)\nClarice Beckett (1887–1935) participated in Women’s Art Club shows until the early 1930s.\nLina Bryans (1909–2000), exhibited 1940–1965 and prominent in the 1960s, resigned 1966, rejoined 1991—.

It was formed in March 1888 when the Victorian Academy of Arts (previously Victorian Society of Fine Arts) and the Australian Artists' Association amalgamated.\nThe Victorian Artists’ Society is a not-for-profit organisation and charity registered with the Victorian government. The Artists' Society routinely practices a range of art forms and styles through classes and gatherings in their permanent home, a heritage-listed bluestone building on Albert Street, Melbourne, opposite St. Patrick's Cathedral. As of 2021, the Victorian Artists' Society premises include four galleries, members’ rooms, an administrative office, and the original bluestone studio which operates as an art school. The original studio was not finished until 1902.\nThe general public can view the seasonal collections of artworks in the gallery or buy artworks. The gallery is open seven days a week and the cost is free entry. New exhibitions are held fortnightly within the five galleries.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Victorian Society of Fine Arts, a forerunner to the Victorian Academy of Arts, was established in 1856. The Victorian Academy of Arts was formed in 1870 with \"about twenty artists and amateurs\" amongst its first members, including Eliezer Levi Montefiore.\nThe Australian Artists' Association held its first exhibition in 1886, with works by Tom Roberts, Louis Buvelot, Frederick McCubbin, and Arthur Streeton.\nIn March 1888 the academy and the Association amalgamated, creating the Victorian Artists Society. The founding president of the new Society was Joseph Anderson Panton; later presidents included Frederick McCubbin and Paul Raphael Montford.\nThe premises at 430 Albert Street in East Melbourne were erected for the society in 1888, enlarged in 1892 and modernised in 1953. Facilities include four galleries, teaching studio, members room, offices and other ancillary facilities.\n\nDuring its early establishment, the Artists’ Society met in a private house in St. Kilda. Its founding members included landscape painter Louis Buvelot, painter Hubert de Castella and etcher J.A. Panton. The Artists’ Society was known for throwing parties and picnics at Brighton. By the 1890s, there were 400 members.\nThis historical building was not limited to fine arts and was also established as a music conservatory that offered singing lessons by Nellie Melba. Melba taught music lessons at the historical building from 1915 until close to her death in 1931. She would perform to crowds outside from the balcony of the house. In 2014, the Society honoured Melba with a special plaque for the gallery to record her musical history at the Victorian Artists’ Society.\n\nThe Artists’ Society was a starting point for young artists of the Heidelberg school, a Victorian impressionist art movement of the 19th century, to exhibit their work and make their first major sales. Artists of the Heidelberg school who were active members of the Victorian Artists’ Society included Charles Conder, Frederick McCubbin, Arthur Streeton, and Tom Roberts.\nMax Meldrum, the Victorian Artists’ Society president in 1917, taught tonal realism at the gallery studio. In 1918 he left the Victorian Artists’ Society to form ‘The Society of Twenty Melbourne Painters’. Meldrum ran this society in its early stages from his studio in Hardware Chambers, Elizabeth Street, Melbourne. They later changed their name to Twenty Melbourne Painters Society.\nMost of the early exhibitors in the Society were women.\nAlbert Tucker, an Australian artist, and member of the Heide Circle, went to night art classes at the Victorian Artists’ Society studio in the 1930s.\nIn 1938, at a VAS meeting, artists interested in contemporary styles decided to form Contemporary Artists’ Society (CAS). CAS is still active.\n\n\n== Today ==\nAs of 2021\nThe Victorian Artists Society is a gallery and p\nThe Society of Women Painters was a major art group in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia in the early 20th century with a significant history across three decades. Significant women creatives of the period such as Eirene Mort, Florence Taylor, Florence Rodway, Ethel Stephens, Maude Sherwood, Frank Payne, Bernice Edwell, Hulda Marshall and Gladys Owen had long connections to the Society of Women Painters and unlike later art historians, contemporary sources document most members as being well trained active professionals with noticeable public profiles, rather than suburban hobbyists.\n\n\n== Establishment ==\nThe establishment of the Society of Women Painters was the culmination of nearly two decades of advocacy and activism for women artists, frequently centred around Ethel Anna Stephens, who was elected to the committee of the Royal Art Society in 1892 to represent the interests of the many female exhibitors. Women made up at least a quarter of the members but had little say in the governance of the organisation. Women artists had been among the large group of artists discontent with selection policies in the two major art groups towards the end of the first decade of the twentieth century.  \n\"During the past three years the pressure of exhibitors claiming space at the Royal Art Society's annual show has led to a good deal of discontent and in 1908 two or three groups of women painters held exhibitions of their own with a large measure of success.\"  \nThe bickering around and between various art groups led to representatives of the Society of Artists making deputations to politicians and demanding that the government pressure the Royal Art Society to share their premises with other groups or otherwise the government should build a new exhibition gallery for other Sydney groups. The Society of Artists' \"interests were also identical with those of the Society of Women Painters, the Institute of Architects, the Photographic Society, Arts and Crafts, and other kindred societies.\" No promise to do so was given.\nThe inaugural meeting to launch the society was held in Edith Cusack's studio in July 1909, and at a second meeting in August 1909 thirty members joined the society and a provisional committee selected pending formal election of officer bearers. Miniaturist, Bernice Edwell was a founding Council member. Emily Meston and Lilian Chauvel were the contacts for membership. The press noted that the group \"really grew into being through the discontent of certain exhibitors in having a percentage of their work excluded from the Royal Art Society's and the Society' of Artists' exhibitions.\" In some ways the Society of Women Painters had a more overtly feminist origin than the much longer lived Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors. Yet from the very start, the Society of Women Painters also identified itself with the most prominent sectors of Sydney society, inviting Lady Chelmsford the Governor's wife, who enjoyed painting, both to show work and be the President of the society. She also opened the first exhibition. In 1928 Lady Fuller, seated on a throne in a bower of greenery, was crowned Queen by Ethel Stephens, in front of 200 guests at the Society of Women Painters' fundraising pageant. This alignment to socially prominent personalities was not untypical of other art and applied art groups in early and mid 20th century Sydney, such as the Arts and Crafts Society and the Embroiderers' Guild.\n\n\n== Reviews ==\nThe Society of Women Painters regularly received poor notices from Sydney critics.  \"From the point of view of the art critic there is little of significance to be noted. The contemporary movements find no echo in this sheltered haven. A feminine flair for prettiness, for apt flower arrangement for agreeable but never bold colour reigns. However the same critic also noted that the black and white section was more radical and \"distinctive\" in outlook than the oils and praised the work of printmakers, including Ethel S\nHenrietta Maria Gulliver (29 October 1866 – 15 July 1945) was an Australian artist who specialized in landscape and floral still-life paintings. She was also a florist, horticulturalist and landscape designer.\n\n\n== Life and family ==\nHenrietta grew up in Sale, in Eastern Victoria.  She was the fifth of eight children born to pharmacist Robert Shanklin and Maria Barbara née Ronalds, who was a professional fly tier and daughter of renowned fly fisherman Alfred Ronalds. Henrietta married George Ekins Gulliver in 1900 and had two daughters. Gulliver was a successful and wealthy pharmacist who developed and manufactured the famous Australian drug \"Laxettes\". They spent the majority of their married life in the Melbourne area although they also lived for several years in Capel, Surrey in England. Sam Griffiths is one of their great-grandsons.\n\n\n== Gardener and florist ==\nHenrietta had moved to Melbourne around 1885 to work for her uncle Nathaniel Ronalds, who was a leading nurseryman and florist. She then opened her own florist business in the city centre which quickly gained a strong reputation. After her marriage she was able to design and create substantial garden estates in Cheltenham and Sassafras, both of which were widely admired.\n\n\n== Painter ==\nHenrietta studied at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in the period 1892-99. Tom Roberts encouraged her interest in painting, and she also interacted with the landscape painter Arthur Streeton, who influenced her style and remained a lifelong friend. She was invited to exhibit at Frederick McCubbin’s studio in 1905. She was a founding member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors and served in two different periods as president.

She was granddaughter to notable sketcher George Sutherland, who emigrated to Australia from Scotland. She was a pupil of Gwen Barringer in South Australia before coming to Melbourne. She attended the National Gallery of Victoria Art School where she was taught by Lindsay Bernard Hall.\nSutherland wrote articles for the Melbourne newspaper 'The Age' and to the journal 'Art in Australia' about Max Meldrum and Hilda Rix Nicholas. \nSutherland was the niece of the painter Jane Sutherland and the sister of the composer Margaret Sutherland. She was also a cousin of Stella Bowen's.  She was a member of the Twenty Melbourne Painters. She had a joint exhibition of oils, watercolours and pastels with fellow artists Dora Wilson and May Roxburgh in 1918. Sutherland had a history with Dora Wilson prior to later established artist societies, exhibiting as part of \"The Waddy\" in 1909, along with Janet Cumbrae Stewart and Nora Gurdon. She enjoyed doing landscapes, renting a cottage in Lilydale with Bernice Edwell and Florence Rodway to sketch the surrounding country. She also exhibited with the Yarra Sculptors' Society. \nShe died in 1948. A memorial exhibition of her work referred to her as \"a quiet artist in a mode of painting now largely abandoned\" and that her works were most sympathetic.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n\tWatercolour paintings by Ruth Sutherland\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n1909, \"The Waddy\" society of artists, Guild Hall\n1909, Federal Art Exhibition, North terrace\n1911, Yarra Sculptors Society, Athenaeum Hall\n1912, \"The Waddy\" society (with Dora Taylor and Janet Cumbrae Stewart), Tuckett and Styles' Gallery\n1912, Group exhibition (with Dora Wilson and Nora Gurdon), Tuckett and Styles' Gallery\n1912 Victorian Artists Society autumn exhibition, Albert Street galleries\n1913, Group exhibition, Athenaeum Hall\n1914, Australian Art Association, Athenaeum Hall\n1914, British History Tableaux (in aid of Red Cross), Victorian Artists Society\n1914, Twelve Melbourne Painters Society second exhibition, Athenaeum Hall\n1915, Victorian Artists Society twentieth annual exhibition\n1916, Victorian Artists Society annual exhibition\n1916, French Week appeal exhibition, Town Hall\n1917, Australian Art Association fifth annual exhibition\n1918, Group exhibition (with Dora Wilson and May Roxburgh), Fine Art Society\n1919, French aid exhibition, Fine Art Galleries\n1919, Twenty Melbourne Painters Society, Athenaeum Gallery\n1919, Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors annual exhibition, Victoria Markets\n1920, Twenty Melbourne Painters Society, Athenaeum Hall\n1940, Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors annual exhibition, Athenaeum Gallery\n1941, Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors annual exhibition, Athenaeum Gallery\n1950, Memorial exhibition for Ruth Sutherland, Melbourne Book Club Gallery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nimages of Ruth Sutherland's paintings on MutualArt\nBiographical cuttings on Ruth Sutherland, National Library of Australia\nRuth Sutherland: Australian art and artists file, State Library Victoria\nDorothea Francis (1903 – 1975) was an Australian artist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nA painter and illustrator, Francis studied under Miss Nankivell and Catherine Hardess in Melbourne. She later studied with her sister Margaret at the George Bell School. She exhibited with the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors and the Melbourne Contemporary Artists winning a prize from the former in 1937. She showed alongside other female artists such as Lina Bryans and Isabel Tweddle. Francis illustrated an early Australian version of Alice in Wonderland in 1937. Her first solo exhibition was in Mornington in 1955. She did exhibit with the Victorian Artists Society in 1946 with Dora Serle and Alan Sumner. With her work \"Composition\" it was said it \"weaves the figures of a woman, a child and a dog in a fruit-shop into a rhythmical design, carried out in patches of clear colour.\"\nFrancis has works in the collections of the State Library Victoria and the Heide Museum of Modern Art.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDorothea Francis: Australian art and artists file, State Library Victoria\nSketchbook by Dorothea and Margaret Francis, State Library Victoria\nCollection of 50 student drawings by Dorothea Francis, State Library Victoria\nThe Athenaeum or Melbourne Athenaeum at 188 Collins Street is an art and cultural hub in the central business district of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Founded in 1839, it is the city's oldest cultural institution.\nIts building on Collins Street in the East End Theatre District sits opposite the Regent Theatre, and currently consists of a main theatre, a smaller studio theatre, a restaurant and a subscription library. It has also served as a mechanics' institute, an art exhibition space, and a cinema. \n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe Athenaeum is a restrained boom-style neoclassical three-storey building designed by architects Smith and Johnson with stuccoed facade with pilasters, label moulds, and bracketed cornice. It was completed in 1886 on the site of the original building of 1842, and is surmounted with a parapet with a niche housing a statue by Richard Kretzschmar of Minerva (Athena, hence 'Athenaeum'), goddess of reason, wisdom, arts and literature. The building was added to the National Trust's Register of Historic Buildings in 1981 and is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nIn August 1840, the Melbourne Mechanics Institution acquired land spanning 110 feet along Collins Street and extending to Little Collins Street, for a sum of £285. The initial structure, a two-story brick building known as the Hall of Arts was completed in December 1842. \nThe first President was Captain William Lonsdale, the first Patron was the Superintendent of Port Phillip, Charles La Trobe and the first books were donated by Vice-President Henry Fyshe Gisborne. Originally called the Melbourne Mechanics' Institute, it was renamed the Melbourne Mechanics' Institution and School of Arts  in 1846.\nThe Melbourne City Council met in the ground floor of the building until 1852 when the Melbourne Town Hall was built. The Institute received an annual grant of £150 from the government, and in 1854, an additional £5,000 was granted for construction of a new building, but from 1857, it had to rely on its own funds. By 1851, the membership count reached 488 individuals. Additionally, it served as the headquarters for the First Church of Christ, Scientist. \nConstruction on the new building began in 1855, but only the front portion was finished. The rear hall, intended to be designed by Charles Webb, was deferred until 1871 and ultimately completed in 1872. Alfred Smith served as the architect, while Turnbull and Dick were the builders. The Institution changed its name to the Melbourne Athenaeum in 1872  During the period when its own church was being reconstructed, Scots Church utilized the premises as its temporary location. \nAmong the office bearers of the institution in the nineteenth century was the author Marcus Clarke who was the chairman of the library committee in 1877. As now, a focal point was the library and by 1877, membership was 1,681 and in 1879 there were 30,000 visits to the library. In 1880 it was reported 'that the floor of the large hall was the only one in Melbourne expressly constructed for dancing'. The remodeled facade was finally concluded in 1886. The statue of Minerva, which was modelled by Richard Kretzschmar on that at the Vatican, was funded through Alderman Thomas Moubray's gift of 100 guineas.\n\n\n=== Theatre and cinema ===\nIn October 1896, the first movie was shown in the Athenaeum Hall. This may not have been the first in Australia however, as a cinematograph was being demonstrated at the Melbourne Opera House in August. On 26 January 1901 Life in Our Navy, a 60,000 foot film of life on HMS Jupiter, was shown by G. H. Snazelle, who provided additional entertainment. \nThe Hall became a regular venue for screening films and the premiere of The Story of the Kelly Gang by the Tait brothers, the world's first dramatic feature film, was at the Athenaeum in 1906.\nThe theatre in its present form, a proscenium arch theatre with 880 seats on three levels, was created in 1924, designed by Henry\nJanie Wilkinson Whyte (1869–1953) was an Australian artist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nWhyte was a painter, etcher, and wood-carver who studied at the National Gallery School from 1890–1895 and together with Dora Wilson and Jessie Traill took lessons in etching from John Mather. Their etchings were published in The Lone Hand in 1907 as some of the earliest works in this field made by women. Whyte was an impressionist artist who painted portraits, figure studies, and landscapes, and was one of the first Melbourne women to paint dockyard scenes. She also painted interiors and flowers, and worked with oils, watercolours, and pastels. Her cityscapes contained charming observations of Melbourne life. Whyte showed with the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors in the 1920s.\nAs part of a first wave of feminist artists in Melbourne, Whyte presented a paper at women's cultural group the Austral Salon along with Violet Teague in August 1907. While a copy of her lecture was not archived it is said she discussed the struggle for Australian women artists to get recognition.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJanie Wilkinson Whyte Australian art and artists file, State Library Victoria\nJanie Wilkinson Whyte : work old and new (Athenaeum, Sept 17–28, 1935) digitised item, State Library Victoria\nErica Wagner (born 1963) is an Australian artist, editor and publisher.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\n\n=== Solo exhibitions ===\n2018 Little Wings, No Vacancy Federation Square, Melbourne\n2016 Sanctuary, No Vacancy Federation Square, Melbourne \n2012 Retreat, Decoy Cafe, Melbourne\n2011 Dark Horse, Cambridge Studio Gallery, Collingwood\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2020 Winner: Australian Book Industry Awards' Pixie O’Harris award for outstanding commitment to children's literature\n2017 Highly Commended: Victorian Artists Society Spring Exhibition (Tarra River, Waiting for the Platypus)\n2017 VAS George Hicks Foundation Contemporary Art Prize\n2017 Dromkeen Medal\n2016 Highly Commended: Victorian Artists Society Winter Exhibition (Hattah Lakes)\n2014 Camberwell Art Show: Deans Encouragement Award, Acrylic Prize (Lagoon)\n2013 Highly Commended: St Kevin's College Art Show (Walk on By)\n2012 Highly Commended: St Kevin's College Art Show (Mt Sonder)\n2011 Winner: Contemporary Art Society of Victoria Annual Exhibition (Telling You the Story of My Life)\n2011 Highly Commended: Contemporary Art Society of Victoria Annual Exhibition (Fay, One Autumn Day)\n2011 Highly Commended: Victorian Artists Society Winter Exhibition (Mermaid Nude)\n2009 Winner: Best Abstract/Contemporary, Pastel Society of Victoria (Angel)\n2005 Winner: Best Non Traditional/Other, Pastel Society of Victoria (Moving Figure, Dance)\n2005 Winner: Victorian Artists Society Winter Exhibition (Moving Figure, Battleground)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nabout Erica Wagner\nThe Pastel Society of Victoria, Australia Inc.\nContemporary Art Society of Victoria\nSt Kevin's College Art Show\nCamberwell Art Show\nNorah Gurdon (Jan-March 1882 - 27 June 1974) was an Australian artist. Her first name is often misspelled Nora in many articles reviewing her work.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nNorah Gurdon was born around Jan-March 1882 in Norfolk, England, to Dr. Edwin John Gurdon and Ellen Ann Randall. She was baptised on 11 April 1882. She was the second of four surviving children, and her family emigrated to Ballarat, Victoria in 1886, travelling on board ship the Carlisle Castle. They eventually settled in Brighton where her father had a doctor's surgery at their home. Gurdon showed early artistic talent while attending Brighton High School for Girls.\n\n\n== Career ==\nGurdon attended the National Gallery School from 1901 to 1908, being taught by noted artists Frederick McCubbin and Bernard Hall. While there she studied with fellow artists Jessie Traill, Dora Wilson, Constance Jenkins, and Janet Cumbrae Stewart, who were to become her lifelong friends. An accomplished landscape and still-life painter, Gurdon exhibited her works with the Victorian Artists Society while still a student. She established her artistic prowess early on by winning the major category for oil painting in the 1909 City of Prahran's Art Exhibition Prize. By the following year she had rented a studio in Collins Street along with friends Stewart and Traill. As well as being a prominent figure in the Melbourne Society of Painters and Sculptors, Gurdon went on to exhibit with fellow National Gallery School alumni in 1913 as part of Twelve Melbourne Painters. The group included Ruth Sutherland, Charles Wheeler, Dora Wilson, May Roxburgh, Percy Leason, Louis McCubbin, Penleigh Boyd, H. B. Harrison, and Frank Cozier.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nIntending to continue her artistic training overseas, in 1914 Gurdon travelled to England with her sister Winifred. Gurdon along with friend Jessie Traill was stuck in Europe due to the outbreak of war ten weeks after arriving. She signed up as a British Red Cross volunteer nurse in a French military hospital at Le Croisic, serving for three and a half years and was awarded a British Victory medal for her services. Much of her painting during this time was landscapes from travels to England and Scotland prior to war breaking out, and when armistice was reached in 1920 she stayed on to paint through Scotland, Suffolk, and Cornwall. This was hardly her only venture overseas however, as she returned in 1927, meeting fellow artists Pegg Clarke and Dora Wilson in Rome, and narrowly avoiding World War II on her 1938 travels to Norway and Sweden.\n\n\n=== Kalorama ===\nUnlike many other female artists of the time, Norah Gurdon was unmarried and financially independent. She purchased land in 1922 with plans to build her dream house in the Dandenong Ranges at Kalorama. When the house was finished she lived there with her sister Winifred and had many fellow artists as guests, with former students and teachers joining her for plen air landscape painting. While Gurdon painted in an impressionist style similar to her contemporaries, she favoured muted blue and grey tones to capture the hills of the Dandenongs. She also enjoyed handicrafts, spending her spare time at tapestry looms designing and producing her own floor rugs and mats.\n\n\tSelected photographs\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nGurdon was a regular and successful exhibitor of work, exhibiting with the Victorian Artists Society, Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, and the Australian Art Association. In the 1920s she held many solo exhibitions at the Athenaeum Gallery, and later at the Women's Industrial Arts Society in Sydney, and the Royal Queensland Art Society in Brisbane. She held an exhibition in 1937 at the Fine Arts Gallery in aid of the construction of St George's Hospital in Kew.\n\n1909\nThe Waddy Club, Guildhall, Melbourne, June 1909\n1910\n\nVictorian Artists' Society, Athenaeum Art Gallery, Melbourne, October 1910\n1911\n\nCity of Pr\nStephanie Taylor (1899–1974) was an Australian artist, printmaker, gallerist, lecturer and art writer and broadcaster. She attained a wide audience in the later 1930s when the Australian Broadcasting Commission featured her art programs on radio stations in Sydney and Canberra as well as her hometown of Melbourne.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nTaylor was the daughter of colonial artist, Elizabeth Ball, who studied at the National Gallery School in the 1860s, was elected as an associate of the Victorian Academy of Arts in 1879 and exhibited with that group.  Elizabeth Ball married Captain Charles Taylor and settled in Williamstown where Taylor and her other three siblings were born.\nTaylor studied with sculptor Charles Douglas Richardson, who became a lifelong friend and whose memorial exhibition she organised in 1933. She also studied at the National Gallery of Victoria School from 1914 to 1922. After leaving the school she shared a studio in Collins Street with fellow Gallery student Dorothy Moore. She showed with the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors in the 1920s.\nTaylor was a competent etcher in the English painter-etcher tradition and a watercolourist. Her greatest impression on her contemporaries was, however, as a lecturer, broadcaster and gallerist, as an incipient iteration of the later curatorial profession. She also published art criticism in the 1930s with the Melbourne journal Adam and Eve.\n\n\n== Cultural impact as an art lecturer ==\nTaylor was best known as a lecturer on the history of art in Melbourne and presented lectures during the 1930s at the National Gallery of Victoria. Although she was opposed to modernism, she supported the Gallery's purchasing of expensive European masterworks. She presented exhibition reviews and lectures on art for ABC radio as early as the 1920s as well as teaching a course in the history of Australian Art at the Emily McPherson College and also in 1934 an art history course for the University of Melbourne. The Sydney Morning Herald claimed that ‘hundreds of art lovers’ had enjoyed her lectures and noted that the Athenaeum Club had made a list of outstanding public lectures delivered in Melbourne and that Taylor had been selected for this honour alongside major scholars from the University of Melbourne of that era,\nProfessors Osborne and Crawford and Sir Ernest Fiske. Perhaps her greatest impact on Australian cultural life was her active lobbying for the establishment of a School of Art History at the University of Melbourne in the 1930s. Her suggestion that the University should teach historical and theoretical matters around art predates the establishment of the Herald Chair of Fine Arts by nearly a decade.\n\n\n== Feminist art advocacy ==\nUnlike many women artists in Australia prior to the 1970s with the exception of Portia Geach, Taylor made many pro-feminist public statements, particularly in relation to equal representation and visibility of artists in the Australian art market. In 1940 she led a deputation to the Chief secretary of Victoria complaining that the director of the National Gallery of Victoria, James Stuart MacDonald was opposed to women artists. \"Most of the few examples of work by women artists are kept in basements and storerooms that are not accessible to the public,\" she said. \"It is rare for a piece by a woman to be purchased for the collection.\" In 1929 she criticised Arthur Streeton for mentioning only one woman artist in an article outlining the history of Australian art. She stated that works by ‘70 or 80’ Australian women artists had been bought by public galleries across the country and listed a group of Australian women who had received major awards and honours overseas. In 1939 she wrote to the editor of the Age  \"I still maintain that there is a popular prejudice against women in the fine arts.\"\n\n\n== Later career ==\nDuring the 1940s she was no longer employed by the National Gallery of Victoria but managed the Velasquez Gallery in Tye's store, 100\nIsabel May (Diana) Tweddle  (1875–1945), was an Australian painter.  She was a member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors and the Twenty Melbourne Painters Society Inc.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nTweddle was born Isabel May Hunter on 26 November 1875 in New South Wales. From 1894 through 1897 she studied at the National Gallery School in Melbourne. There she met fellow artist Ada May Plante.\nAfter her studies she began exhibiting at the Victorian Artists Society. In 1904 she married Joseph Thornton Tweddle, an Australian businessman and philanthropist. The couple traveled throughout Europe, and lived in London, England in 1921. Tweddle visited Scandinavia and the Pacific (the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, and Japan). Her paintings from  those trips were exhibited in London.\nTweddle had an interest in Post-Impressionist art, mainly though the work of Arnold Shore and William Frater. She is thought to have influenced Sybil Craig, Peggie Crombie and Jessie Mackintosh.\nShe was a member of many artistic groups in Melbourne; the Contemporary Art Group, the Contemporary Art Society, the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, and the Women's Art Club.\nHer paintings are in the collections of the Shepparton Art Museum, the National Gallery of Victoria, and the Art Gallery of New South Wales.\nShe died  on 9 July 1945 in Melbourne.\nTweddle Place in the Canberra suburb of Chisholm is named in her honour.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n1943, from 1 December; Inclusion in a group show of ninety-one paintings and etchings with Arnold Shore, Max Meldrum, John Rowell, Jas.

She studied art at the National Gallery School under W.B. McInnes, later doing weekend classes at George Bell's Bourke Street studio in the 1930s. She studied at the Gallery School at the same time as Sybil Craig, Constance Stokes, and Helen Ogilvie, though they were in different classes. Her mother didn't want her to continue studying art, and got her to go work at a flower shop instead. Bernard Hall allowed her to continue studying part time, a privilege not afforded to many at the time.\nShe first exhibited with The New Group at the Athenaeum Gallery in 1937, at a show consisting of still-life, landscape, and drawings. The group consisted of artists Albert Tucker and Hal Porter, and Maidie's work The Portrait of Minka was considered second only to Tucker. A review of the show in The Herald by Basil Burdett described her work as showing real promise. McGowan's portrait Manya featured in the Herald Exhibition 'Outstanding Artists of 1937' and alongside Thea Proctor's article in Art in Australia.\nMcGowan attended classes at the Victorian Artists Society with her future husband Colin around this time. She was a founding member of the Contemporary Art Society and later a three-terms President of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors. Her and Colin married in 1948 and moved to Mount Eliza, mostly withdrawing from the art scene. They later returned in 1954 by invitation to help launch the Peninsula Arts Society. She was encouraged to return to practicing art during this time by George Bell, returning to his classes while also teaching art at Mount Eliza.\nColin worked in printing at an advertising firm, and Maidie's work Collage of Screenprinted Paper was made out of posters he screenprinted. She would gift this work to Bell on his 80th birthday. In the 1960s McGowan would become the first secretary of the McClelland Gallery Group, with Colin printing and designing the invitations and catalogues. The group's membership included artists such as Daryl Lindsay. Her work and experience led to her assisting in curation for two exhibitions at the National Gallery of Victoria in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nApril–May 1978, Paintings of Figure and Landscape by Maidie McGowan, Clive Parry Galleries\nApril–May 1988, George Bell Students & Friends, Holland Fine Art\nOctober 1988, Jim Alexander Gallery Spring Exhibition\nMay–June 1990, Modern Australian Paintings, Bridget McDonnell Gallery (with Sidney Nolan, Arthur Boyd, Charles Blackman)\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMaidie McGowan retrospective : November 4, 1995 – January 7, 1996, State Library Victoria\nForm and flowers : Maidie McGowan, Anne Montgomery, Marjorie Woolcock, State Library Victoria\nNew Group, Melbourne, Vic. : Australian Gallery File, State Library Victoria\nMaidie McGowan : Australian Art and Artists file, Art Gallery of New South Wales Research Library and Archive\nBiographical cuttings on Maidie McGowan, National Library of Australia\n\n\n== References ==\nAlice Marian Ellen Bale, known as A.M.E.

Distancing herself from her fellow female artists who were more aligned with the suffragette movement, Bale preferred to work hard within the constraints of the traditional structures of the art world, and never left Victoria. \nAn active member of the Pickwick Club of Kew, she would gather with young members, some of whom were fellow Gallery School students, for weekly discussions where they adopted the personas of Charles Dickens' characters. There she developed an intimacy with fellow club member Norman Brown, which came to an end by 1906 with Brown's departure and Bale's reluctance to leave her ordered family life.\nAs a painter Bale did landscapes and portraits but was best known for her flower studies. She was able to sell her paintings and exhibit in not just Australia but also London and Paris.\nShe exhibited with the Melbourne Society of Women Painters 1917–1955.\n\n\n== Other activities ==\nBale edited the Victorian Artists' Society's journal VAS before her efforts to reform the society in 1917 and 1918 and an election loss got her ousted as a troublemaker. Her friend Jo Sweatman, the last remaining female office bearer, was ousted also a few months later on an electoral technicality. They became foundation members of the Twenty Melbourne Painters Society, Bale holding the position of secretary until her death.\n\n\n== In collections ==\nArt Gallery of New South Wales,\nNational Gallery of Victoria.\nCastlemaine Art Museum\n\n\n== Awards ==\nShe was a finalist in the Archibald Prize in 1922, and 1924, while 1932 Ernest Buckmaster's portrait of her was a finalist in the Archibald.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nBale died on 14 February 1955 in Melbourne.\n\n\n=== Scholarships and prizes ===\nIn 1977 Peter Wegner was awarded the A.M.E. Bale residential painting scholarship under Sir William Dargie, awarded by Glen Eira City Council, which he undertook from 1978 to 1980.\n\n\n==== AME Bale Travelling Scholarship and Art Prize ====\nBale established the biennial A.M.E. Bale Travelling Scholarship and Art Prize through her will to support Australian artists in perpetuity. The prize \"is intended to encourage, support and advance classical training of emerging artists (in their early to mid-career) at any stage of life, who are pursuing the study and practice of traditional art and who desire to study the works of old masters\".\nThree prizes are awarded:\n\nMajor Award for a Travelling Scholarship (A$50,000) since 2011\nA.M.E. Bale Art Prize in the medium of oil and/or acrylic (A$5,000)\nA.M.E.

Bale, State Library Victoria\nDora Lynnell Wilson (31 August 1883 – 21 November 1946) was a British-born Australian artist, best known in her adopted country of Australia for her etchings and street scenes.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDora Lynnell Wilson was born on 31 August 1883 in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Her parents were James Wilson, agent, and Annie Maria, née Green. The family emigrated to the state of Victoria in Australia in 1884, when Dora was a year old.\n\n\n== Education ==\nWilson was educated at Somerset School and Methodist Ladies' College in Melbourne. From 1901–1906 she studied at the National Gallery under Bernard Hall and Frederick McCubbin, forming friendships with fellow artists Ruth Hollick, Gwendolyn Grant, Norah Gurdon, and her partner Pegg Clarke. She also took lessons from John Mather with Jessie Traill and Janie Wilkinson Whyte.\n\n\n== Artistic career ==\nWilson was best known for her etchings, pastels and oils of still lifes and nudes. Her work was praised for her 'strong sense of colour' but also critiqued for demonstrating a 'chocolate box prettiness'.\nHer work was included in a number of notable exhibitions, including the five week Australian Exhibition of Women's Work in Melbourne, a Royal Academy exhibition of Australian art in London. In 1923 her work, 'Reve d'Or', was reproduced on the cover of Women's World and exhibited at the Société des Artistes Français in Paris.\nHer studio at Collins Street West was the meeting place of ex–Gallery School students who exhibited in 1913–14 as 'The Twelve Melbourne Painters.' This group included Jessie Traill, Janet Cumbrae Stewart, Norah Gurdon, Penleigh Boyd, and Lindsay Bernard Hall. Wilson was also a member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors.\nFrom the 1920s onwards she concentrated largely on street scenes, and in  1923 she was commissioned by Sir Baldwin Spencer to undertake a series of paintings of European landmarks, which saw her travelling around Europe for over two years, accompanied by the photographer Pegg Clarke. In 1928 these works were exhibited at the Beaux Arts Gallery, London, and the following year at Australia House. In the early 1930s she focused on historical scenes from Melbourne's history, with an exhibition entitled 'Milestones of Melbourne' held at the Fine Art Society Gallery in March 1935. Her work was received favorably by Arthur Streeton for being \"fresh in colour and treatment and free from the depressing appearance of black paint.\" In 1937 she joined and exhibited with Robert Menzies' Australian Academy of Art.\n\n\tDora L Wilson, Pictures Collection, State Library Victoria\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Death ==\nWilson died of cancer on 21 November 1946 and was cremated at Springvale Cemetery, Melbourne.

She went to school at Girton College in Bendigo and then studied drawing and sculpture at the Bendigo School of Mines. She continued her studies in Melbourne at Swinburne Technical College and then at the Royal College of Art in London. On her return to Melbourne in 1930 she established a studio at Grosvenor Chambers (9 Collins Street, Melbourne, subsequently occupied by Georges and Mirka Mora), later moving to Gipps Street, East Melbourne.\n\n\n== Works ==\nCohn's works in bronze, stone and wood are held in many state and regional galleries. Important works include:\n\nthe Fairies' Tree in the Fitzroy Gardens, Melbourne which she sculpted between 1931 and 1934 and donated to the children of Melbourne and\nthe statue for the Pioneer Women's Memorial Garden in Adelaide, South Australia, carved in limestone in 1940–1941.\nThe Fairies Tree work also inspired her writing and publication of The Fairies' Tree (1932), More about the Fairies' Tree (1933) and Castles in the Air (1936). Her book Mostly Cats was published in 1964. In 2014 her autobiography was published; A Way with the Fairies: The Lost Story of Sculptor Ola Cohn.\n\n\n== Career and influence ==\nShe was president of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors from 1948 to 1964, a founding member of the Australian Sculptors Society and an active member of the Victorian Artists' Society, the Victorian Sculptors' Society and Melbourne Contemporary Artists.\nThrough her membership of artists' and sculptors' societies, Cohn gave lectures and demonstrations to make sculpture more accessible to the public. Private instruction in sculpture was given from her studio in East Melbourne, which became an important centre for artists. During the Second World War, she gave recreational sculpture lessons for soldiers.\nCohn travelled through Europe and Iceland from 1949 to 1951. In 1952, she won the Crouch Prize at Ballarat for her woodcarving, \"Abraham\". This was the first time that the prize had been awarded to a sculpture.\nHer studio home in Gipps Street, East Melbourne, was bequeathed to the Council of Adult Education (since renamed the Centre for Adult Education) and is now known as the Ola Cohn Memorial Centre.\nIn 2002, the Centre for Adult Education considered selling Cohn's studio to raise money for new buildings. A public campaign at the time motivated the Victorian state government to intercede and fund the restoration of the Ola Cohn Memorial Centre Her studio at Gipps Street is still under the control of the CAE and is heritage listed.\n\n\n== Honours and awards ==\nOn 1 January 1965, shortly after her death, Cohn was appointed a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for her work in the service of art, especially sculpture. In 2007, she was added to the Victorian Honour Roll of Women.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\nABC Radio - Hindsight, Broadcast 28 September 2008, The Word in the Stone: sculptor Ola Cohn\n\n\n== External links ==\nPapers of Ola Cohn, 1912–1964, State Library Victoria\nPolly Hurry (2 May, 1883, Kyneton - 5 August 1963, Frankston), was an Australian painter. She was a founding member of the Australian Tonalist movement and part of the Twenty Melbourne Painters Society.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDescribed in a 2009 review by Sasha Grishin as “a South Australian Meldrumite who has been almost totally forgotten,” Mary 'Polly' Hurry in fact was born in Kyneton, Victoria, on 2 May, 1883, daughter of Henry Hurry and Mary Herring and the middle child of two siblings, Maurice and George. She spent her early years there at the family home South Lodge, 29 Donnithorne Street, then was educated at Ruyton Girls' School, Kew.\n\n\n== Training ==\nLater, at the Kyneton School of Mines, Hurry took lessons in drawing and wood carving, then studied watercolour painting with the Scottish-born artist, John Mather. During a camping holiday she met several artists, who like Mather were associates of the tonalist Max Meldrum, and decided to take up art seriously. She began drawing from life at Melbourne's 1859 Old Temple Court building where studios were occupied by students of Frederick McCubbin; Jessie Traill, Dora Wilson, Janet Cumbrae Stewart, Norah Gurdon and AME Bale; before approaching Meldrum to join his studio as one of the first of his pupils, alongside Harry McClelland.\n\n\n== Australian tonalist artist ==\nHurry regarded Meldrum as the most important influence on her artistic development, but the association also shaped her personal life; in Meldrum’s studio she met John Farmer whom she married on 13 August 1921. Farmer (1897-1989) was a close friend of fellow student 10 years younger, Justus Jorgensen, when both attended the National Gallery School in 1914, where he also met Clarice Beckett and Colin Colahan. Brought up in a large family in Brunswick, Farmer worked as a scenery painter for J.C. Williamson Ltd. Richard McCullin, a drawing master at the Gallery School, suggested that students might be interested in going to hear a lecture in 1917 by controversial young painter, Max Meldrum, who argued that \"the art of painting is a pure science - the science of optical analysis.\"\n\nHurry became a founding member of the original Twenty Melbourne Painters Society — Jas Stuart Anderson, Alice Bale, Elsie Barlow, Alexander Colquhoun, George Colville, Edith Downing, Bernice Edwell, William Frater, Henrietta Maria Gulliver, Carl Hampel, C.E. James, Richard McCann, Bertha Merfield, A.E. Newbury, Clara Southern, Ruth Sutherland, Jo Sweatman,  Isobel Tweddle, and Rose A. Walker  — all supporters and students of Meldrum, which split from The Victorian Artists Society in protest at his defeat in the 1918 election for its president. In 1919, the breakaway group held their first exhibition. Twenty Melbourne Painters Society founding Secretary A.M.E. Bale declared:“We desire nothing but sincerity and a humble study of nature, from which alone all art, whether decorative or realistic, draws any enduring life.”\nAlso in 1921, Hurry entered the inaugural Archibald Prize, in which 41 works were submitted and all exhibited from 17 January 1922 for two months. The Prize was awarded to WB McInnes, but no catalogue for the 1921 exhibition has been found, and the subject of the work submitted by Hurry is not known. \nThe couple shared one of the purpose-built studios (Studio 2) at the 1888 Grosvenor Chambers, 9 Collins Street, Melbourne (its name a direct reference to Grosvenor Gallery of London) occupied also at various times by Meldrum, Tom Roberts, Frederick McCubbin, Arthur Streeton, Percival Ball, Charles Francis Summers, Clara Southern, Jane Sutherland, Charles Conder, E. Phillips Fox, John Longstaff, Girolamo Nerli, Louis Abrahams, Rose Walker, George Lambert, and Ola Cohn. Frequent visitors to the studio were Janet Cumbrae Stewart, Norah Gurdon, Dora L. Wilson (who also had a studio in the building), Jessie Traill, Norah Wilkie and Margaret Pestell.\n\n\n== Asia ==\nFor their honeymoon the Farmers left via Hong Kong for China, visiting Sha\nPeggie (or Peggy) Crombie (1901–1984) was an Australian modernist painter. She was a member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCrombie was born in 1901 in Melbourne, Australia. In 1921 she studied art at Stott's Commercial Art Training Institute. From 1922 through 1928 she attended the National Gallery Art School in Melbourne, where she was taught by Lindsay Bernard Hall, William Beckwith McInnes and George Bell.\nCrombie exhibited her work with modernist groups in Melbourne, specifically The Embryos, the 1932 Group, the New Art Club, the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, and the Victorian Artists Society.\nCrombie died in 1984.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nimages of Peggy Crombie's paintings on MutualArt\nPeggy Crombie [Australian art and artists file], State Library Victoria\nMabel Pye (9 April 1894 — 4 March 1982) was an Australian artist noted for painting and printmaking.\n\n\n== Early life and training ==\nPye was born in Box Hill in 1894 to Alice Eleanor Noar and her husband William Edward Pye who married in 1893. She had a younger sister Hazel, also an artist, and their father built them a studio at the back of their Loch Street home in Surrey Hills, Victoria. Her family was associated with amateur theatre group 'The Benwerrin Players'.  Mabel had to be rescued when swimming at Moon Bay near Black Rock when she was 19, which she visited with her family. She studied at the National Gallery School with Adelaide Perry and Napier Wallace under Bernard Hall. She studied drawing from 1912-1915, and painting 1915-1919.\n\n\n== Career ==\nWorking in watercolours and linocuts, Pye painted landscapes, still-lifes, and portraits with bold colours and lines. She was a member of the Victorian Artists Society from 1918-1941, and the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, with whom she served on the committee with Esther Paterson, Ola Cohn, Jessie Mackintosh, Sybil Craig, Lina Bryans, and Violet McInnes. As well as exhibiting with both societies she also protested to the Lord Mayor about destruction of trees on Alexandra Avenue.\nShe was particularly noted for her ballet scenes. As part of their training Russian student dancers were made to visit art shows, and Pye painted impressions from memory of the Ballet Rambert, and was also a member of the Australian Ballet Society. She was also known for landscapes, painting atmospheric works of the Blue Dandenongs.\nShe has works in the collections of State Library Victoria, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, and the National Gallery of Victoria.\n\n\n== Death ==\nIn later life she lived in Montrose and Olinda, and died in 1982 in Mont Calm, Canterbury.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMabel Pye: Australian art and artists file, State Library Victoria\nChooks in the market, State Library Victoria\nWorks in Art Gallery of New South Wales\nWorks in National Gallery of Victoria\nimages of Pye's art on Invaluable\nMaude Edith Victoria Glover Fleay (1869–1965), was one of Australia's first wildlife artists.

She studied drawing at the School of Mines, Ballarat, where she was taught by David Davies. She also studied under Frederick McCubbin at the National Gallery School in Melbourne. Her aunt, Elizabeth Glover, owned \"Gracedale Hotel\" in Healesville. Fleay did a painting of \"Gracedale\", which hung in Elizabeth Glover's home in Gardenvale.\nShe exhibited with the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors and she was a member of the Victorian Artists Society. In 1938 she exhibited at the Athenaeum Gallery with fellow women artists Annie Gates and Henrietta Maria Gulliver. Glover Fleay exhibited at the Leighton Galleries in 1945 where her work was commended for its \"rather unfeminine strength and confidence of approach.\" Noted artist Arthur Streeton said her paintings \"reflect great sympathy with and knowledge of the animals.\" She was also a writer and music teacher, and art director of the Daylesford School of Mines.\nIn 1905 she married William Henry Fleay at St. Peter's Church of England, Sturt Street, Ballarat. They had three children, including the naturalist David Fleay. She brought out a book with David, Gliders of the Gumtrees, for which she did the illustrations.\n\nFleay died on 18 May 1965 in Colac.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nTo honor her contribution to Australia's natural history, the Maude Glover Fleay Award was established by the Victorian College of the Arts. She gifted funds to establish a Maude Glover Fleay Bequest at the Art Gallery of Ballarat, for purchasing works by female artists. Her works \"Gum trees\", \"End of day\", and \"Consider the lilies\" are in the Gallery's collection. An exhibition showcasing her work, The Fabulous Maude, showed at The Lost Ones Contemporary Art Gallery in Ballarat in 2018.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nThe Girl from Sulky Gully: A Review of the Life of Australian Artist Maude Glover-Fleay: 1869-1965\nMaude Glover-Fleay : Australian art and artists file, State Library Victoria\nScrapbook, Maude Edith Victoria Glover-Fleay, Sovereign Hill Gold Museum\n\n\n== References ==\nThis is a list of Australian artists.\n\n\n== A ==\n\nBack to top\n\n\n== B ==\n\nBack to top\n\n\n== C ==\n\nBack to top\n\n\n== D ==\n\nBack to top\n\n\n== E ==\n\nBack to top\n\n\n== F ==\n\nBack to top\n\n\n== G ==\n\nBack to top\n\n\n== H ==\n\nBack to top\n\n\n== I ==\n\nBack to top\n\n\n== J ==\n\nBack to top\n\n\n== K ==\n\nBack to top\n\n\n== L ==\n\nBack to top\n\n\n== M ==\n\n\n== N ==\n\nBack to top\n\n\n== O ==\n\nBack to top\n\n\n== P ==\n\nBack to top\n\n\n== Q ==\n\nBack to top\n\n\n== R ==\n\nBack to top\n\n\n== S ==\n\nBack to top\n\n\n== T ==\n\nBack to top\n\n\n== U ==\n\nBack to top\n\n\n== V ==\n\nBack to top\n\n\n== W ==\n\nBack to top\n\n\n== X ==\n\nBack to top\n\n\n== Y ==\n\nBack to top\n\n\n== Z ==\n\nBack to top\n\n\n== See also ==\nAustralian art\nAustralian painter stubs\nSchools\nAntipodeans Group\nHeide Circle\nHeidelberg School\nHermannsburg School\nMerioola Group\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDesign & Art Australia Online\nEthel Carrick, later Ethel Carrick Fox (7 February 1872 – 17 June 1952) was an English Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painter. Much of her career was spent in France and in Australia, where she was associated with the movement known as the Heidelberg School.\n\n\n== Life ==\nEthel Carrick was born in Uxbridge, Middlesex, to Emma (Filmer) Carrick and Albert William Carrick, a wealthy draper. The family of ten children lived at Brookfield House, Uxbridge. She trained in London at the Guildhall School of Music and at the Slade School of Fine Art under Henry Tonks (ca. 1898-1903). She married the Australian Impressionist painter Emanuel Phillips Fox in 1905. They moved to Paris, where they remained until 1913. She travelled widely in Europe, North Africa, and the South Pacific (Tahiti) during this period and made trips to Australia in 1908 and 1913.\nThe outbreak of World War I brought Carrick and her husband to Melbourne, Australia, where they  organised to raise war funds from artists and to support the French Red Cross.\nEmanuel died of cancer in 1915, and the following year Carrick began two decades of travels that took her through the Middle East, South Asia including India, and Europe. She returned intermittently to Australia to exhibit her work and go out on painting expeditions around the country. In the 1920s, she was recommended by the Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Paris as a private teacher of still life painting, and she counted a number of Australians and Americans in Paris among her students.\nShe died in Melbourne in 1952, aged 80.\n\n\n== Art career and critical estimation ==\n\nMainly a painter, Carrick is known for her floral still life, landscapes and scenes of outdoor urban life in parks and on beaches. Some of these draw on her international travels, such as her paintings of outdoor markets in the Middle East and elsewhere. In the 1920s, she began painting flower studies, which overall are more conventional than her earlier work. In the 1930s, she created some lithographs, and during World War II, which she spent in Australia, she painted some scenes of women war workers.\nCarrick began as an Impressionist plein air painter but fairly quickly moved to a more Post-Impressionist style featuring blockier compositions and sharper colour contrasts. Some of the works produced around 1911-12 are distinctly Fauvist in their strong colours, high abstraction, and loose handling of the paint.\nCarrick first showed her work in London in 1903. She exhibited at the Paris Salon d'Automne from 1906 onwards, the London Royal Academy of Arts, the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts (from 1906 on), and various progressive galleries in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia (from 1908 on). In addition to her own solo and group exhibitions, she was in dual shows with her husband at the Melbourne Athenaeum in 1914 and again in 1944. \nIn 1911, she became sociétaire of the Salon d'Automne, and she served as a jury member from 1912 to around 1925, both unusual positions for women to hold and marks of the high regard in which she was held by the Paris art world. Prior to World War I, she also served as the vice-president of the International Union of Women Artists. Late in her career, in the 1940s and 1950s, she exhibited with the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors.\nIn her lifetime, Carrick's reputation was eclipsed by her husband's, in part because she spent a good deal of her time promoting his career rather than her own, lobbying Australian collectors and curators to buy his work and arranging exhibitions both while he was alive and posthumously. In recent years, her reputation has been rising, and critics today consider her work more adventurous than that of her husband. In 1996, one of her paintings set an auction record of A$105,500 for works by an Australian woman artist, and the following year saw the publication of a biography, Ethel Carrick Fox: Travels and Triumphs of a Post-Impressionist by art historian Susanna de Vries.\nClara Southern (3 October 1860 – 15 December 1940) was an Australian artist associated with the Heidelberg School, also known as Australian Impressionism. She was active between the years 1883 and her death in 1940. Physically, Southern was tall with reddish fair hair, and was nicknamed 'Panther' because of her lithe beauty.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nSouthern was born in Kyneton, Victoria, in 1860, the eldest of six children. She was the daughter of local timber merchant and farmer John Southern and Jane Elliott. From 1883 to 1887, Southern studied at the School of Design, National Gallery of Victoria under Oswald Rose Campbell and at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School under George Folingsby and Frederick McCubbin.\nDuring her studies she joined the Buonarotti Club, a bohemian society of writers, painters and musicians to which other members of the Heidelberg School belonged. She is credited by some as 'among the first women to be elected' to it in 1886, though several other female artists were already members, and amateur poet and painter Alice Brotherton had been the first woman elected to the Club in 1883, followed by several other important women artists such as Jane Sutherland and May Vale, who both joined in 1884.\nSouthern was a member of the Victorian Artists Society, the Australian Art Association, the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, the Twenty Melbourne Painters, and the Lyceum Club. Paving the way for women's involvement in the arts, Southern was the first female member of the Australian Artists' Association.\nWhen in Melbourne Southern shared a studio at Grosvenor Chambers, 9 Collins Street, with Jane Sutherland and Tom Roberts from 1888. She taught art classes from her studio, and regularly joined her Heidelberg School colleagues on plein air painting trips to Heidelberg and Eaglemont.\n\n\n== Warrandyte ==\nBy 1908 Southern had established an artistic community of younger landscape painters at Warrandyte, a township on the Yarra about 30 kilometres from Melbourne. The community included Penleigh Boyd and Harold Herbert. Her teacher and mentor Walter Withers often visited her in Warrandyte to paint the landscape. Her residence at cottage 'Blythe Bank' in Warrandyte was integral to the development of the artistic community there, with regular visits from the McCubbins and Colquhouns, and Jo Sweatman becoming her neighbour at 'Kipsy.' Many of her works capture the spirit of the area, such as 'Evensong' and 'A Cool Corner', and she encouraged many a young artist to visit her studio there. At one point she was regarded as the eminent female landscape artist in Melbourne.\nOn 9 November 1905, Southern married local miner John Arthur Flinn at St. John's Anglican Church in Blackburn. Together they built a cottage, and later a studio, at Blythe Bank, Warrandyte. Even after her marriage, Southern continued to exhibit under her own name.\nAn Old Bee Farm, held by the National Gallery of Victoria is one of her better known works. It was one of 56 paintings included in Lloyd O'Neil's Classic Australian Paintings, and was used as the cover illustration for Kay Schaffer's 1988 book Women and the Bush: Forces of Desire in the Australian Cultural Tradition.\n\nClara was also supportive of charity and relief efforts, supporting Violet Teague and her sister Una in an exhibition for the Hermannsburg Mission Water Supply in Central Australia. Bushfires were a devastating risk in her township of Warrandyte, and she contributed to the Artists' Bushfire Relief Fund Exhibition. Unfortunately some time after her death, her beloved cottage 'Blythe Bank' was lost to bushfires.Miss Clara Southern (Mrs J. Flinn) is a sweet and original singer of the Australian bush in colour, which, by the most skilful use of her pigments, she realises in all its beauty and charm, its majestic silences, its harmonies, and those mysterious distances we all know and feel when in its midst. We can almost hear the wind sighing and sobbing through her tr\nJane Rebecca Price (18 February 1860 – 24 May 1948) was an Australian painter who was a foundation member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors. Two of her works have been acquired by the National Gallery of Victoria and two by the Art Gallery of South Australia.  She was a close associate of members of the group of painters known as the Heidelberg school.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nPrice was born in Cheddar, Somerset, England, on 18 February 1860. Her father, William Thomas Price, was a clergyman, her mother was Rebecca Jane Evans; she had five siblings.\nPrice trained as an artist at the Royal College of Art (RCA) in London (then called the South Kensington Art School).\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nAt the age of 20, Price migrated from England to Sydney, then moved to Melbourne two years later.  She returned to Sydney several times (1907–1910, 1925, 1935) but lived chiefly in Melbourne’s suburbs, spending her final 13 years in St. Kilda, at the house of her friend Ina Gregory, another artist who is associated with the Heidelberg school.\nPrice continually painted throughout her life, but, needing an income and somewhere to live, also worked as a governess, which reduced her productivity as an artist. She was a governess for artists Alexander and Beatrix Colquhoun from 1903, and later for Frederick and Annie McCubbin. Her paintings were exhibited by the Victorian Artists Society between 1882 and 1906, and at other places in Melbourne.\nPrice enjoyed life-long friendship with artists who were central to the circle that came to be known as the Heidelberg school.  Amongst her closest associates were Jane Sutherland, Clara Southern, Tom Roberts and Frederick McCubbin. Hammond and Peers  record that Price is mentioned in a letter written by McCubbin to Roberts  noting that he was pleased to see that \"Janey Price did very well\" in an exhibition held at McCubbin's house in Shipley St, South Yarra, in 1906.

It is known that among these founders were Daisy Stone, Tina Gowdie, Annie Gates, Kate Allan, Ella Thorn, Henrietta Maria Gulliver and a Miss Stock (otherwise unidentified, who died in 1906). In 1905 they added the indigenous word  \"Woomballano\" (meaning either 'everlasting beauty' or 'search for beauty') to identify their Art Club, changing its title to The Women's Art Club in 1913 then to the Melbourne Society of Women Painters in 1930.

The Society was less overtly feminist than its Sydney counterpart The  Society of Women Painters (later named Women’s Industrial Arts Society) which was founded in 1910 in reaction to the discrimination of male-dominated juries of art institutions and societies.

Her parents were James Wilson, agent, and Annie Maria, née Green. The family emigrated to the state of Victoria in Australia in 1884, when Dora was a year old.\n\n\n== Education ==\nWilson was educated at Somerset School and Methodist Ladies' College in Melbourne. From 1901–1906 she studied at the National Gallery under Bernard Hall and Frederick McCubbin, forming friendships with fellow artists Ruth Hollick, Gwendolyn Grant, Norah Gurdon, and her partner Pegg Clarke. She also took lessons from John Mather with Jessie Traill and Janie Wilkinson Whyte.\n\n\n== Artistic career ==\nWilson was best known for her etchings, pastels and oils of still lifes and nudes. Her work was praised for her 'strong sense of colour' but also critiqued for demonstrating a 'chocolate box prettiness'.\nHer work was included in a number of notable exhibitions, including the five week Australian Exhibition of Women's Work in Melbourne, a Royal Academy exhibition of Australian art in London. In 1923 her work, 'Reve d'Or', was reproduced on the cover of Women's World and exhibited at the Société des Artistes Français in Paris.\nHer studio at Collins Street West was the meeting place of ex–Gallery School students who exhibited in 1913–14 as 'The Twelve Melbourne Painters.' This group included Jessie Traill, Janet Cumbrae Stewart, Norah Gurdon, Penleigh Boyd, and Lindsay Bernard Hall. Wilson was also a member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors.\nFrom the 1920s onwards she concentrated largely on street scenes, and in  1923 she was commissioned by Sir Baldwin Spencer to undertake a series of paintings of European landmarks, which saw her travelling around Europe for over two years, accompanied by the photographer Pegg Clarke. In 1928 these works were exhibited at the Beaux Arts Gallery, London, and the following year at Australia House. In the early 1930s she focused on historical scenes from Melbourne's history, with an exhibition entitled 'Milestones of Melbourne' held at the Fine Art Society Gallery in March 1935. Her work was received favorably by Arthur Streeton for being \"fresh in colour and treatment and free from the depressing appearance of black paint.\" In 1937 she joined and exhibited with Robert Menzies' Australian Academy of Art.\n\n\tDora L Wilson, Pictures Collection, State Library Victoria\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Death ==\nWilson died of cancer on 21 November 1946 and was cremated at Springvale Cemetery, Melbourne.

Joan Kerr has her death only as an estimate; \"between 1956 and 1958,\" while a 2009 exhibition sets it at 1959. Pegg Clarke claimed to be some seven years younger than Dora L Wilson, her lifelong companion, who was born in 1883. Dr. Jim Mitchell, archivist of Scotch College has proposed that she was related to Olive Clarke, secretary to Dr Colin Gilray, the college principal, from 1934 to 1953.\n\n\n== Career ==\nClarke had an early win with a picture Minnie in the October 1915 Australasian photo-review Home Portraiture Competition.\nRosebank from which she was operating before 1923 was row of terraces in Hawthorn that took its name from a 19th-century estate from which their land was subdivided. Her work featured in prominent early 20th century Australian magazines, at first in thumbnail portraits for The Bulletin. While the Australian quarterly The Home launched by Ure Smith in 1920, nominated Harold Cazneaux (1878–1953) as their \"Special Photographer\", Pegg Clarke, probably 8 to 12 years his younger was accorded bylines in almost every issue from its inception for photographs of stately homes and portraits of artists, and performers. During the interwar period, Clarke's clientele included rich and prominent Melbourne society figures at Government House and Flemington race track of Lady Stradbroke (wife of the Governor of Victoria), Dame Margaret Davidson (wife of the Governor of NSW), and Lady Allardyce (wife of the Governor of Tasmania).\nHer main rival, Ruth Hollick, award-winning society photographer who exhibited in Australia and internationally, and one of Australia's most successful professional photographers soon became a friend. With her professional and life partner Dorothy Izard, Hollick met the painter Dora Wilson and her lifelong companion Pegg Clarke (the pair were soon to share a studio), and together the two close couples forged a strong personal friendship. A 1937 article in The Australian Home Beautiful makes clear that despite their lasting relationship their tastes differed, with Wilson favouring period-style decor for their studio and Clarke, the modernist furnishings.\n\nBy the end of WW1 Clarke, along with her friend Hollick, were considered the leading photographers in Melbourne. Both were respected for their fashion photography, their high society portraits, especially of debutantes and brides, and their portraits of visiting celebrities such those by Clarke of actress Joan Rowell, wives of diplomats and composer/musician Margaret Sutherland. Amongst Clarke's more famous friends, and subjects of her portraits were Australian poet Dorothea Mackellar, and Dame Sybil Thorndike The Australian Gallery Directors' Council notes that, \"[t]he role of Cazneaux covering home and social photographs for magazine in Sydney was shared by Hollick and Clarke in Melbourne.\"  Hollick specialised in fashion photography and Clarke in interiors and architecture. She also provided photographic reproductions of her friend Dora Wilson's paintings to the press.\nFrom 1923 Clarke started to advertise her services with mention of her inclusions in \"The London Salon 1921\" and \"The Pittsburgh Salon 1922\", and shifted with Wilson to an upstairs studio which they shared in Linden Hall, a block of luxury flats at 403 Glenferrie Road, Malvern, then from 1927-1940s, relocated to a studio she designed at 476 Glenferrie Road, Hawthorn, opposite the private school Scotch College, the clientele and grounds of which she photographed.\n\n\n=== Europe ===\n\nNewspapers' social columns covered the couple's activities regularly, and the farewell parties when in April 1927 they readied to d\nDora De Winton was a British actress of the silent era. Born Dora Wilson in London in 1874, De Winton was a well-known drama and comedy theatre performer during the 1880s. She starred in a number of films from 1912 to 1925, especially melodramas and crime films. She began her film career working with the British & Colonial Film Company in 1912, but with her first feature film in 1913 she worked with the Barker Film Company, where she would remain for most of her acting career. She may be best remembered for her role as Miss Western in Edwin J. Collins's Tom Jones starring Langhorn Burton and produced by the Ideal Film Company in 1917, and also for her last screen performance as Lady Barmouth in The Presumption of Stanley Hay, MP at the Stoll Film Company in 1925.

The sixth of seven siblings; Cora Harriet, Irene Selby, Hilda Elsie, Charles Edmund, Harold Edgar, and Richard Harbison, she was also a direct descendant of John Evelyn, the seventeenth-century diarist and horticulturist. Her father was stationmaster at Numurkah and reportedly much-liked, but tragically committed suicide due to insomnia in 1904, when she was seven years old.\n\n\n== Training ==\nRoach was living with her family at 'Sayes', Gordon Street Toorak when, from age sixteen, she studied at the Drawing School of the National Gallery of Victoria Art School from 1913 to 1916 under the guidance of Frederick McCubbin and William Beckwith McInnes. Later, she joined its School of Painting from the second term in 1916 to 1921, studying under  head of the Painting School, Lindsay Bernard Hall, and where she was first noted in a December 1917 review as a still life painter in an exhibition works of students\nIt was during this time that she became close to fellow student Madge Freeman. In addition, she received private lessons in watercolour painting from M. J. MacNally. In 1918, she was photographed for Punch at the Students' Fancy Dress Bal Masque dressed as a 'gypsy.'\n\n\n== England and Europe ==\nIn May 1923, Roach and Freeman organised their first joint exhibition of watercolours at the Fine Art Society's Galleries in Melbourne. In January 1924, having raised funds from their romantic Hilderesque watercolors and sold their painted and lacquered 'Madgelma' woodwork, they ventured to England, settling in the artists' hub of Chelsea. There, they briefly attended the Slade School under the tutelage of Henry Tonks. The two friends shared flats in London and Paris and embarked on painting journeys across France, Italy, Spain, and North Africa. In St Ives, Cornwall, they shared a studio with Gwen Horne.\n\n\n== Influences ==\nDuring their time in Paris, Roach and Freeman came into contact with Adolphe Milich (1884 - 1964), a French painter and teacher originally from Poland. Milich was associated with the School of Paris and specialised in oil and watercolour paintings, focusing on landscapes, still life, figure compositions, and portraits. His artistic approach, heavily influenced by Paul Cézanne, had a profound impact on Roach during the years she studied under him.\n\n\n== Australian exhibitions ==\nWhile in Europe, Roach would send her artwork back to Australia for exhibition with the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, The Independent Group, and various Melbourne commercial galleries. \n\nProfiled in a magazine article in February 1927 after her return from overseas only weeks before, she is described as: a Melbourne girl who has made herself a place in the artistic world with her craftsmanship in stained wood. Her ware is known by its beautiful glaze. Candlesticks, boxes and the like decorated with floral designs and shining like glass are among her fancies. Just a month or two ago she returned from a three years tour, chiefly on the Continent, and she has added to her repertoire designs in bas-relief and a fine French enamel finish. Though now known chiefly for her stained wood bric-a-brac, of which she is the originator here, she is also painter, and her watercolor sketches of scenes in Italy were hung at the last art show of the year at the Athenæum Gallery. While in France Elma had lessons at a famous arts and crafts school in Paris. She intends to hold an exhibition soon.Her first solo show was at the Fine Art Society in July 1927. In a new venture the Cheyne run by Rene Monteath Roach showed enamelled wood alongside etchings by John Shirlow, paintings by Dora Wilson, and pottery of Merric Boy\nDora Nkem Akunyili    (14 July 1954 – 7 June 2014) was the Director-General of National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) of Nigeria from 2001 to 2008.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nDora Edemobi was born in Makurdi, Benue State, Nigeria to Chief Paul Young Edemobi who hailed from Nanka, Anambra State. She received her First School Leaving Certificate from St. Patrick's Primary School, Isuofia, Anambra State, in 1966 and had her West African School Certificate Examination (W.A.S.C) at Queen of the Rosary Secondary School Nsukka, Enugu State in 1973, where she graduated with Grade I Distinction consequently, she won the Eastern Nigerian Government Post Primary Scholarship and the Federal Government of Nigeria Undergraduate Scholarship. She went on to study Pharmacy at the University of Nigeria (U.N.N.), graduating in 1978 and received her Ph.D. in ethnopharmacology in 1985.\n\n\n== Career ==\nShe served on several State Government Boards and then was named Supervisory Councilor for Agriculture in a Local Government unit in Anambra State. She worked as a hospital pharmacist in the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital. (U.N.T.H), Enugu State.\nIn 1981, she became a Graduate Assistant in the FaU.NN. of Pharmaceutical Sciences, U.N.N. In 1990, she became a Senior Lecturer and in 1996, she was made a Consultant Pharmacologist at the College of Medicine.\nIn 1996, Akunyili became Zonal Secretary of the Petroleum Special Trust Fund (P.T.F), coordinating projects funded by profits from oil in Nigeria's South Eastern States. In 2001, President Olusegun Obasanjo appointed her the Director-General of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC).\n\n\n=== NAFDAC ===\nShe was appointed NAFDAC DG in 2001 and served till 2009.\nAkunyili had a special motivation for attacking the country's counterfeit drug problem  and this is because, in 1988, she had watched her sister aged 21, die after being given injections of fake insulin as part of regular diabetes treatment. She put together a team of mostly female pharmacists and inspectors and started a war against counterfeit drugs that saw many open-air medicine markets across the country closed down. Including one in Kano State after her officers confiscated £140,000 worth of fake drugs. The agency, under her leadership, broadcast jingles on radio and television to make the public aware of the dangers of substandard drugs and to encourage people to report suspicious drugs while also publishing lists of counterfeit products regularly in the newspapers.\nIn July 2003, the International Children's Heart Foundation visited Nigeria to operate on sick children at a teaching hospital in Enugu. After four children died in what appeared to be a case of counterfeit medical supplies, and despite being confronted with what seemed to be a hospital cover-up, Akunyili confiscated supplies and found fake adrenalin, fake muscle relaxant and infected intravenous drips.\nAs of June 2006, she was reported to have secured convictions for 45 counterfeiters with 56 cases pending. Her efforts led to increased public awareness about counterfeit drugs and more direct and purposeful surveillance at Nigerian customs.\n\n\n==== Assassination attempt ====\nOn 26 December 2003, while Akunyili was on the way to Anambra State in Eastern Nigeria, gunmen fired on her convoy. The bullets narrowly missed her, with one of the bullets going through her headscarf and through the windscreen of the car. Prior to the incident, she had faced constant death threats against herself, her family, and her staff. In 2014, at least six people were charged with conspiracy and attempted murder, but acquitted and discharged in 2014.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nIn 2008, Akunyili was appointed Minister of Information and Communications.\nShe resigned her appointment as Minister of Information and Communications on December 16, 2010, after two years of service to run for office as senator representing Anambra Central in\nRuth Sutherland (1884–1948), was an Australian painter and art critic.

She was granddaughter to notable sketcher George Sutherland, who emigrated to Australia from Scotland. She was a pupil of Gwen Barringer in South Australia before coming to Melbourne. She attended the National Gallery of Victoria Art School where she was taught by Lindsay Bernard Hall.\nSutherland wrote articles for the Melbourne newspaper 'The Age' and to the journal 'Art in Australia' about Max Meldrum and Hilda Rix Nicholas. \nSutherland was the niece of the painter Jane Sutherland and the sister of the composer Margaret Sutherland. She was also a cousin of Stella Bowen's.  She was a member of the Twenty Melbourne Painters. She had a joint exhibition of oils, watercolours and pastels with fellow artists Dora Wilson and May Roxburgh in 1918. Sutherland had a history with Dora Wilson prior to later established artist societies, exhibiting as part of \"The Waddy\" in 1909, along with Janet Cumbrae Stewart and Nora Gurdon. She enjoyed doing landscapes, renting a cottage in Lilydale with Bernice Edwell and Florence Rodway to sketch the surrounding country. She also exhibited with the Yarra Sculptors' Society. \nShe died in 1948.

Her contribution to this \"landmark scholarship directed attention to the lives of Black women and, combined with the numerous articles she wrote thereafter, helped remedy the emphasis within Feminist Studies on white women and within Black studies on Black men\".\n\n\n== Context ==\n\nThe interest in black feminism was on the rise in the 1970s, through the writings of Mary Helen Washington, Audre Lorde, Alice Walker, and others.: 87 \nIn 1981, the anthology This Bridge Called My Back, edited by Cherríe Moraga and Gloria E. Anzaldúa, was published and But Some of Us Are Brave was published the following year. In both anthologies, the emphasis was placed on the intersection between race and gender. The contributors argued that previous waves of feminism had focused on issues related to white women. They wanted to negotiate a large space for women of color. According to Teresa de Lauretis, This Bridge Called My Back and But Some of Us Are Brave revealed \"the feelings, the analyses, and the political positions of feminists of color, and their critiques of white or mainstream feminism\" and created a \"shift in feminist consciousness.\": 221 \n\n\n== Impact ==\nIn the 2000 reprint of their anthology, editors Hull, Bell-Scott, and Smith described how in 1992 black feminists mobilized \"a remarkable national response\" - African American Women in Defense of Ourselves - to the controversy: xvi  surrounding the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court of the United States against the backdrop of allegations by law professor Anita Hill, about sexual harassment that became part of Thomas' confirmation hearings.\nLegal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw cited But Some of Us Are Brave at the beginning of her seminal 1989 paper, \"Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics\", in which she introduced the concept of Intersectionality. Crenshaw is known for introducing and developing intersectional theory to feminism. Crenshaw noted that it was one of the \"very few Black women's studies books\". She used the title All the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are Men, But Some of Us are Brave, as her \"point of departure\" to \"develop a Black feminist criticism\".: 139 \nBarbara Y. Welke published her article entitled \"When All the Women Were White, and All the Blacks Were Men: Gender, Class, Race, and the Road to Plessy, 1855–1914\", in reference to Hull et al., in 1995 in the Law and History Review. Welke wrote how Crenshaw, referring to But Some of Us Are Brave, said that the title \"sets forth a problematic consequence of the tendency to treat race and gender as mutually exclusive categories of experience and analysis.: 139  : 139 \n\n\n== Related readings ==\nThis Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color (1981), edited by Cherríe Moraga and Gloria E.

Her first name is often misspelled Nora in many articles reviewing her work.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nNorah Gurdon was born around Jan-March 1882 in Norfolk, England, to Dr. Edwin John Gurdon and Ellen Ann Randall. She was baptised on 11 April 1882. She was the second of four surviving children, and her family emigrated to Ballarat, Victoria in 1886, travelling on board ship the Carlisle Castle. They eventually settled in Brighton where her father had a doctor's surgery at their home. Gurdon showed early artistic talent while attending Brighton High School for Girls.\n\n\n== Career ==\nGurdon attended the National Gallery School from 1901 to 1908, being taught by noted artists Frederick McCubbin and Bernard Hall. While there she studied with fellow artists Jessie Traill, Dora Wilson, Constance Jenkins, and Janet Cumbrae Stewart, who were to become her lifelong friends. An accomplished landscape and still-life painter, Gurdon exhibited her works with the Victorian Artists Society while still a student. She established her artistic prowess early on by winning the major category for oil painting in the 1909 City of Prahran's Art Exhibition Prize. By the following year she had rented a studio in Collins Street along with friends Stewart and Traill. As well as being a prominent figure in the Melbourne Society of Painters and Sculptors, Gurdon went on to exhibit with fellow National Gallery School alumni in 1913 as part of Twelve Melbourne Painters. The group included Ruth Sutherland, Charles Wheeler, Dora Wilson, May Roxburgh, Percy Leason, Louis McCubbin, Penleigh Boyd, H. B. Harrison, and Frank Cozier.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nIntending to continue her artistic training overseas, in 1914 Gurdon travelled to England with her sister Winifred. Gurdon along with friend Jessie Traill was stuck in Europe due to the outbreak of war ten weeks after arriving. She signed up as a British Red Cross volunteer nurse in a French military hospital at Le Croisic, serving for three and a half years and was awarded a British Victory medal for her services. Much of her painting during this time was landscapes from travels to England and Scotland prior to war breaking out, and when armistice was reached in 1920 she stayed on to paint through Scotland, Suffolk, and Cornwall. This was hardly her only venture overseas however, as she returned in 1927, meeting fellow artists Pegg Clarke and Dora Wilson in Rome, and narrowly avoiding World War II on her 1938 travels to Norway and Sweden.\n\n\n=== Kalorama ===\nUnlike many other female artists of the time, Norah Gurdon was unmarried and financially independent. She purchased land in 1922 with plans to build her dream house in the Dandenong Ranges at Kalorama. When the house was finished she lived there with her sister Winifred and had many fellow artists as guests, with former students and teachers joining her for plen air landscape painting. While Gurdon painted in an impressionist style similar to her contemporaries, she favoured muted blue and grey tones to capture the hills of the Dandenongs. She also enjoyed handicrafts, spending her spare time at tapestry looms designing and producing her own floor rugs and mats.\n\n\tSelected photographs\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nGurdon was a regular and successful exhibitor of work, exhibiting with the Victorian Artists Society, Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, and the Australian Art Association.

Trained by Frederick McCubbin at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School, and by painter and printmaker Frank Brangwyn in London, Traill worked in England and France in the period immediately preceding World War I. During the war she served in hospitals with the Voluntary Aid Detachment.\nTraill is best known for a series of prints created in the early 1930s depicting the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Critic and art historian Sasha Grishin describes her as \"one of the great Australian artists of the 20th century\".\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nJessie Traill was born in Brighton, Victoria, on 29 July 1881. Her father was Scotland-born George Hamilton Traill, who had administered a vanilla plantation in the Seychelles, before becoming a bank manager in Victoria; her mother Jessie Neilley was Tasmanian.\nTraill was one of four daughters of George and Jessie, all of them educated at a boarding school in Switzerland, where they learned French and German. The family were deeply religious Anglicans; two of Traill's sisters would later join religious orders, while Margaret would become a carver.\nReturning to Australia, Traill in 1900 studied under John Mather (artist) at his Austral Art School.  In 1903 she kept a notebook of her lessons commenting on the etchings within it as they progress through various states. The notebook details her active engagement in the print making process and the tuition of John Mather. Together with jottings of sales, news clippings and a congratulatory letter from John Mather, her early success with the medium is documented. \nJessie Traill also studied at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School from 1902 to 1906, where she was taught by a leading member of the Heidelberg School, Frederick McCubbin. Her fellow students were mostly women and included Hilda Rix Nicholas, Norah Gurdon, Ruth Sutherland, Dora Wilson, and Vida Lahey. In March 1906, Traill and her sister Minna, together with her father, sailed for England, while her two older sisters, Kathleen and Elsie, remained in Victoria. George died while they were travelling in 1907, and is buried in Rome.\nTraill studied in London under Anglo-Welsh painter and printmaker Frank Brangwyn, as well as taking classes in summer with him, in Belgium and the Netherlands. She was the most accomplished student from Australia that he taught.\n\n\n== Early career, 1908 to 1931 ==\nTraill's first notable successes were in 1909, when works by the artist were hung at the Paris Salon and London's Royal Academy of Arts, while her first solo show was opened in Melbourne. She was successful again in 1914 with work hung at the Royal Academy.\nWhen war broke out in 1914 Traill, like fellow artist Iso Rae, joined the Voluntary Aid Detachment. She worked in hospitals, including at a convalescent facility in Roehampton in May 1915, then later in a military hospital in Rouen. Traill and Rae became the only Australian women artists to portray the war while in France. When in 1918 Australia first appointed official war artists, sixteen men were chosen; Traill was not included.\nBack in Australia, Traill in 1921 became a member of the Australian Painter-Etchers' Society, and entered its exhibitions. Her works from this period reflected her interest in both Art Nouveau and in the woodblock printing of Japan.\n\n\n== Sydney Harbour Bridge series ==\nWhen the Australian Painter-Etchers Society in 1932 held its only thematic exhibition, Sydney Harbour Bridge Celebrations, Traill contributed a series of seven prints. The works comprised six etchings completed across the period 1927 to 1931, and a coloured aquatint created after construction was finished in 1932. These have become Traill's best known and most highly regarded images. At the time they were created, the artist Arthur Streeton observed: Melbourne should be proud of that fine draughtswoman and etcher Miss Jessie Traill. By incessant labour \nAustralian women in World War I, were involved in militaries, and auxiliary organisations of the Allied forces abroad, and in administration, fundraising, campaigning, and other war time efforts on home front in Australia. They also played a role in the anti-war movement, protesting conscription, as well as food shortages driven by war activities. The role of women in Australian society was already shifting when the war broke out, yet their participation on all fronts during the Great War escalated these changes significantly.\nThe Australian Imperial Force (AIF) restricted women's enlistment to participation in the Australian Army Nursing Service (AANS), accepting only single women with professional nursing degrees, as well as a group of trained masseuses, 14 ward assistants and one bacteriologist. Initially the union of the AANS into the AIF was unclear and disorganized, with the nurses having no official rank. Tensions between the organisations resulted in principal matron Jane Bell of the AANS, and Lieutenant-Colonel William Ramsay Smith of the AIF to be recalled from duty. A subsequent enquiry into the feud resulted in the AANS receiving official recognition and officer rankings, with Evelyn Conyers leading the AANS as Matron-in-Chief for the duration of the war. Many nurses were decorated with military honours such as the Royal Red Cross, and seven nurses received the Military Medal for demonstrating bravery under fire.\nWomen doctors were told they would not be accepted into the Australian, or British militaries, and likewise there were no roles for women as cooks, orderlies, ambulance drivers, or any other role. However, many women who were determined to serve found their own way abroad, and participated through auxiliary organisations such as Red Cross organisations, and the Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service, or simply created their own opportunities by establishing hospital units, such as Rachel Ward's, Australian Voluntary Hospital, and Helen Sexton's Hôpital Australien de Paris, or by establishing canteens for soldiers in Cairo as Alice Chisholm did. Some Australian women were also able to enlist the French and eventually the British militaries. The most senior Australian woman in military service during the war was Maud McCarthy, the British Expeditionary Force Matron-in-Chief for France and Flanders.\nAustralian women also played a significant role on the Australian home front. Led by Lady Helen Munro Ferguson, Australian women played a fundamental role in establishing the Australian branch of the British Red Cross, just a few days after the outbreak of the war. This organisation became the Australian Red Cross. Women undertook fundraising and recruiting activities as well as organising comfort packages for soldiers serving overseas. Other women also filled jobs made vacant by men joining the armed forces.\nAnti-war movements and campaigns were established by Australian women including the Women's Peace Army led by Vida Goldstein. Women were actively involved in campaigning on both sides of the debate on conscription, leading to events such as the Conscription disturbance at the Brisbane School of Arts which saw public conflict between the Women's Compulsory Service Petition League and the Brisbane branch of the Women's Peace army, led by Margaret Thorp. Anti-war protests led to some women, such as Adela Pankhurst being arrested for public disturbance.\nNevertheless, despite this involvement, women have never occupied a central position in the Australian version of the Anzac legend, although since the 1970s their role has been examined in more detail as a result of the emergence of feminist historiography, and specialist histories such as the history of nursing.\n\n\n== Australian societal context ==\nWith the British colonisation, Australian society became firmly patriarchal. Men held dominant positions in society, professional professions, and politics, as well as in families, having legal right of ownershi\nAllan Holder Jordan (1898–1982) was an Australian painter, designer, printmaker and teacher.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAllan Jordon was born in 1898 in Elsternwick, the son of Sandhurst-born customs agent James Oliver Jordan and Maud Ethel (née Alleyne) who married in 1897.\nLiving in Malvern, Jordan's interest at age sixteen was in amateur photography, on the subject of which he contributed three articles, with concise diagrams, to The Australasian Photo-Review, one in the 15 January 1916 edition about making \"Photographic Bookplates,\" another on building a home darkroom in a bathroom, and one instructing how to use a camera as a solar enlarger. His photographs featured in the magazine, and he was also awarded prizes in the A P-R competitions.\n\n\n== Career ==\nJordan studied at Swinburne Technical College from 1915–1919.\n\n\n=== Printmaker ===\n\nHe worked mainly in woodcuts and wood engraving and was an influential teacher in printmaking and book arts in Australia. His oeuvre numbers sixty graphic prints, twenty designed and illustrated small books and seventy-one bookplates, as well as drawings, paintings, pastels and small mosaics, a body of work noted by Robert Littlewood \"for its consistent quality of design and draftsmanship combined with the expert manner in which the works have been created.\"\nLittlewood identifies  \"three notable areas of interest in Jordan's creative effort: linocuts and colour woodcuts in the 1930s; book design and illustration in the 1940s; and bookplate design for two decades from 1939 until 1958.\" Jordan exhibited in group shows through the 1930s, and less frequenlty in subsequent years.\n\n\n=== Coin design ===\nAfter complaints to the Federal Treasurer that some of Australia's coin designs were heraldically incorrect, action was taken in September 1946, when Prime Minister Chifley, while at Renmmark, was presented with a suggested lyrebird design by Jordan to replace the coat of arms displayed on the sixpence that was claimed to be obsolete. Chifley promised to consider the Jordan's design made in collaboration with Sydney V. Hagley of the Numismatic Society. Ultimately the design of the coin was unchanged.\n\n\n=== Illustrator ===\nAmongst his work are five wood engravings for Joseph O'Dwyer's The Turning Year 1944. Other designs he created for Hawthorn Press, Melbourne in the 1940s included a series of paperback booklets printed on lesser-quality wartime paper and sold at 1 shilling and sixpence, which were written by Frank Clune, each dealing with some aspect of Australian history, such as his 1944 Stories of Central Australia.\n\n\n=== Bookplates ===\nJordan joined artists Neville Barnett, Roy Davies, Adrian Feint, Lionel Lindsay and Philip Litchfield in a revival of the bookplate before World War Two. His Ex Libris bookplates often employ intricate rebuses to characterise their owners, and such is the case with that he created for World War Two hero Russell Francis Wright MBE (1920-2012).\nJordan’s prints and paintings are in national and international collections.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nJordan's work in a 1931 group show was praised in The Age as \"the most unique of the four contributors,\"for his fifteen color and black prints from wood blocks\" and picked out for \"an outstanding print in black, Treasure Ship, admirably drawn and full of movement.\" The Bulletin reviewing the same show reports that \"Allan Jordan has been trying to capture some of the subtlety of Melbourne's winter atmosphere per the very difficult medium of the woodblock, and in The Changing Skyline, Exhibition Building and Winter Sunshine, Fitzroy Garden, has succeeded in nabbing some of the bolder contrasts.\" Artist and critic Harold Herbert also prasied his work in that show, writing that \"Mr. Jordan is an accomplished designer and an efficient craftsman.\"\nOf a joint exhibition he held in Melbourne in 1932 with Dorothy Lungley, the Age reviewed his linocuts, etchings and drypoints, describing the colour prints as \"uniformly good in execution and concep\nJanie Wilkinson Whyte (1869–1953) was an Australian artist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nWhyte was a painter, etcher, and wood-carver who studied at the National Gallery School from 1890–1895 and together with Dora Wilson and Jessie Traill took lessons in etching from John Mather. Their etchings were published in The Lone Hand in 1907 as some of the earliest works in this field made by women. Whyte was an impressionist artist who painted portraits, figure studies, and landscapes, and was one of the first Melbourne women to paint dockyard scenes. She also painted interiors and flowers, and worked with oils, watercolours, and pastels. Her cityscapes contained charming observations of Melbourne life. Whyte showed with the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors in the 1920s.\nAs part of a first wave of feminist artists in Melbourne, Whyte presented a paper at women's cultural group the Austral Salon along with Violet Teague in August 1907. While a copy of her lecture was not archived it is said she discussed the struggle for Australian women artists to get recognition.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJanie Wilkinson Whyte Australian art and artists file, State Library Victoria\nJanie Wilkinson Whyte : work old and new (Athenaeum, Sept 17–28, 1935) digitised item, State Library Victoria\nThe Australian Academy of Art was a conservative Australian government-authorised art organisation which operated for ten years between 1937 and 1946 and staged annual exhibitions. Its demise resulted from opposition by Modernist artists, especially those associated with the Contemporary Art Society, though the influence of the Academy continued into the 1960s.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Precedents ===\nEfforts to form an art academy in Australia were initially limited to individual States: The Academy of Arts, Australia, under the presidentship of P. Fletcher Watson was founded in Sydney in 1891, with its first exhibition held in 1892, but survived only four years. The Society of Artists, founded in Sydney in 1897, and the Australian Artists’ Association, of Melbourne, both had members from various States, but held their regular exhibitions only in their home states.\n\n\n=== Formation ===\nAspiring to the principles of the long-established, but independent, privately funded, and also by then conservative, British Royal Academy of Arts (founded in 1768), Attorney-General Robert Menzies envisaged an overarching, Federal organisation promoting art that would be \"understood by\" the ordinary Australian amongst the middle class who were his prime supporters in his later prime-ministerships.\n\nIn The Argus of 3 May 1937 in an article headed \"Does Not Like the \"cross-eyed drawing\" of Modern Art,\" he was reported to take issue with the idea that this might be de facto censorship of \"those whose conception of art is not his,\" as had been suggested by Mr. Norman Macgeorge in a letter published the previous Saturday. MacGeorge, Menzies responded, was \"misinformed about the object of the proposed Australian Academy;\" It is true, however, as Mr. Macgeorge claims, that I find nothing but absurdity in much so-called modern art, with its evasion of real problems and its cross-eyed drawing. It is equally true that I think that in art beauty is the condition of immortality - a conclusion strengthened by an examination of the works of the great European masters and that the language of beauty ought to be capable of being understood by reasonably cultivated people who are not themselves artists. I realise that an academy should find room in its membership for all schools of artistic thought provided they are based on competent craftsmanship. So much do I realise this truth, which I take to be the basis of Mr. Macgeorge's letter, that at the outset, when mentioning the academy idea to a committee of artists, I stipulated that I would take no steps to further it unless this principle were adhered to. The published list of those invited to join the proposed academy is the best proof that the principle has been followed. The list was selected by artists of the highest standing. My only function has been, and is, as an uninstructed lover of fine painting and drawing, to do as much as I can to help obtain for Australia the benefits of an artistic organisation which has been invaluable in England.\"\nSubsequently, at a meeting of ten state delegates in the smokeroom of the Canberra Hotel, Menzies formed the Australian Academy of Art, on 19 June 1937 and was its inaugural chair.  Where long-established European art academies were teaching institutions, the Australian Academy was not, and served to present annual salons by invitation to established artists.  Its other role was to advise government on art administration as \"a body which will be recognised as a standard reference on art.\" It was to be the second such academy in the British dominions, following Canada's which was established in 1880 with a Royal charter, which was sought also by Australia's.\n\nThe Academy was to continue in an anti-Modernist stance, with one member, Norman St Clair Carter, describing 'contemporary art' as a 'fungoid growth.' While tolerating some Australian post-impressionism, its exhibitions showed traditional figurative and realist paintings by Hans Heysen, William Dargie, John Longsta\nEileen Alberta Boyd became Mrs Gordon Lane (13 December 1890 – 14 September 1975) was an Australian singer. She began as a child performer and she toured in the UK during World War One.\n\n\n== Life ==\nBoyd was born in 1890 in Sydney to Margaret (born Shalvey) and Albert Boyd. Both her parents had been born in Australia and her father ran a hotel. Her parents arranged lessons for her in singing and elocution and she was a child singer. She toured New Zealand in 1900 when she was known as the \"The Baby Baritone, Clog Dancer and Whistler\". She continued her education with a tutor while on tour. In 1910 a concert was arranged in Sydney to mark her transition from a child performer to a singer with a fine contralto voice. In 1915 she married in Britain in May and in October she was a widow with a child and a young teenage step-daughter. Her husband, Hugh Ernest Roberts had been a master mariner.\nIn 1917 she sang at the Royal Albert Hall in London and many prestigious venues when she joined a tour in support of the Red Cross starring and organised by Clara Butt and Kennerley Rumford. She and Butt were \"favourably compared\" and they sang  The Dream of Gerontius being George V and Queen Mary in 1917. By 1925, she had two children although she still found time to sing as Mrs Gordan Lane.\nIn 1934 she was still using the name \"Eileen Boyd\" when recording. In 1937 it was \"Mrs Gordon Lane\" who commissioned a pastel portrait from the Australian artist Dora Wilson. It was called \"Nada\" and it was exhibited at Margaret MacLean's Gallery in Melbourne.\nBoyd died in 1975 in Hammondville.\n\n\n== Recordings include ==\n\nYour King and Country Want You, Jumbo, c. 1915\nThe Stranger of Galilee,1934\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography at ADB\nThe Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, established in Melbourne, Victoria in 1902, is the oldest surviving women's art group in Australia.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors (MSWPS) began in 1902 as a monthly gathering of eight former students of Frederick McCubbin from the National Gallery School which members called the Students' Art Club. It is known that among these founders were Daisy Stone, Tina Gowdie, Annie Gates, Kate Allan, Ella Thorn, Henrietta Maria Gulliver and a Miss Stock (otherwise unidentified, who died in 1906). In 1905 they added the indigenous word  \"Woomballano\" (meaning either 'everlasting beauty' or 'search for beauty') to identify their Art Club, changing its title to The Women's Art Club in 1913 then to the Melbourne Society of Women Painters in 1930. The present designation was adopted in 1954.\nMany of its early members were plein air painters and identified with the Heidelberg School, which was regarded widely as a male group but which involved many women. The interest in the decorative arts at the opening of the twentieth century attracted other members who were significant craftspeople. By the 1920s, the Society was assimilating the generation of professional women artists emerging from the Melbourne National Gallery School, with significant women artists, representatives of both the Meldrum tonal school and modernism, being invited to join. The Society was less overtly feminist than its Sydney counterpart The  Society of Women Painters (later named Women’s Industrial Arts Society) which was founded in 1910 in reaction to the discrimination of male-dominated juries of art institutions and societies.  During the Second World War the MSWPS opened volunteer headquarters at Grosvenor Chambers (9 Collins Street, Melbourne) where they made and sold handcrafts and art to raise money for the war effort.\nMSWPS has met at heritage-listed Ola Cohn House 41-43 Gipps Street, East Melbourne since the sculptor's death in 1964. She was President of the Society from 1948 to 1964.\n\n\n== Notable members ==\nMelbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors members included:\n\nCristina Asquith Baker, painter, print-maker (1868–1960)\nAlice Marian Ellen Bale (1875–1955), Studied at National Gallery School 1895–1904, from 1917 to 1955 a consistent exhibitor with the Women’s Art Club \nMargaret Francis Ellen Baskerville sculptor (1861–1930)\nClarice Beckett (1887–1935) participated in Women’s Art Club shows until the early 1930s.\nLina Bryans (1909–2000), exhibited 1940–1965 and prominent in the 1960s, resigned 1966, rejoined 1991—.

Green, and starring George Brent, Bette Davis, and Ann Dvorak. The screenplay by Manuel Seff and Lillie Hayward is based on a story by Hayward and Robert Lord.\nA print is held at the Library of Congress.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nNan Reynolds (Ann Dvorak) struggles to run the household on her meek husband Bill's (George Brent) meager salary as an office manager. She urges him to apply for better jobs elsewhere, but he is disinclined to take risks, and his lack of ambition is placing a strain on their marriage.\nPat Berkeley (Bette Davis), who attended high school with Nan and Bill, is hired by his firm as an advertising copywriter, and her success prompts Nan to coerce her husband into asserting himself with his boss. When he fails to spark any interest with his ideas, Bill succumbs to his wife's suggestion that he start his own agency using the money she has managed to save. Spurred by Nan, he steals a major client from his former firm and hires Pat to help him handle it. Complications arise when the feelings the two had for each other years before are reignited and they embark upon an affair. Nan becomes aware of their relationship but chooses to ignore it.\nBill announces he wants a divorce. When Nan refuses to grant him one, he angrily leaves the house and accidentally hits their son Buddy (Ronnie Cosby) with the car, seriously injuring him. Months pass, Buddy recovers, and Bill and Nan's divorce is in its final stages. Hearing Nan's court testimony, Bill realizes how good she is as a wife and mother and how much he loves and needs her, and the two decide to reconcile.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nGeorge Brent as William Reynolds\nBette Davis as Patricia Berkeley\nAnn Dvorak as Nan Reynolds\nJohn Halliday as Paul Duprey\nRuth Donnelly as Dora Wilson\nHobart Cavanaugh as George Wilson\nRobert Barrat as Sam Blake\nJoseph Cawthorn as Krueger (as Joe Cawthorne)\nPhil Regan as Radio Singer\nWillard Robertson as Judge\nRonnie Cosby as Buddy Reynolds\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nFrank S.

Mr. Brent and Miss Dvorak do as well as any one might expect, but Miss Davis is a trifle too obvious as the siren.\"\nAlthough Variety called it \"satisfactory entertainment,\" when asked about the film in later years, Bette Davis responded, \"Dear God!

It is the first installment in her Regency Faerie Tales trilogy. The novel follows Theodora \"Dora\" Ettings, a girl unable to feel and express her emotions since the faerie Lord Hollowvale stole half of her soul. After moving to London, Dora meets the royal magician Elias Wilder, who promises to help her find a cure. However, he is busy investigating a mysterious sleeping plague that is spreading among children in the workhouses. Dora joins the investigation, which will lead her to confront Lord Hollowvale once again.\nAtwater published Half a Soul on her own in 2020, before it was acquired by Orbit Books and re-released in 2022. Reviewers appreciated its cozy atmosphere that contrasts with the portrayal of the darker side of London during the period.\n\n\n== Development and publication ==\nOlivia Atwater submitted her first novel to a publishing company at the age of twelve, but later decided to pursue different careers and continue writing in her spare time. The first idea for Half a Soul came from a singular scene where the protagonist washes her gown in a fountain during a ball. Atwater said: \"I just had the idea that she was a Regency lady who felt and acted as though she were in a dream, and I knew it was going to be difficult for her because that sort of thing would not do well in an era of strict manners.\" While researching the Regency period, she decided to also portray the struggles of the lower social classes, introducing a more serious element to the story.\nAfter researching self-publishing, Atwater followed a friend's advice and published Half a Soul on her own in 2020. It was the first installment in her Regency Faerie Tales trilogy, later followed by Ten Thousand Stitches and Longshadow. Orbit Books acquired the English rights for all three novels in 2022 from Christable McKinley at David Higham Associates. The ebook editions were released in April 2022, while the new paperback edition of Half a Soul was published in June 2022. Matthew Burne illustrated the new covers for all the novels. German and French rights were sold to CBJ and Albin Michel, respectively.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring the Regency era, Theodora \"Dora\" Eloisa Charity Ettings lives with her aunt and uncle, Lady and Lord Lockheed, and their daughter Vanessa in the English countryside after her parents' death. Dora wanders into the woods and encounters the faerie Lord Hollowvale, who claims Dora's mother sold her to him and tries to steal her soul. However, Vanessa stabs him with a pair of iron scissors and the faerie escapes with only half of Dora's soul. Dora has now heterochromatic eyes and is unable to feel and express most of her emotions. Her aunt says she is cursed and urges them to keep the secret to avoid bringing shame on their family. Fearing the faerie might come back, Vanessa gives the scissors to Dora for protection.\nYears later, her aunt is trying to find a husband for Vanessa, who suggests moving their search to London. They stay at Lady Hayworth's house and both ladies exclude Dora from preparations for future balls. While exploring London, Dora ends up in a magic shop where she sees a glimpse of the future in a mirror: she is wearing a gown stained with what seems to be blood. She also meets the royal magician, Elias Wilder, and Lady Carroway's third son, physician Albert Lowe, who invites her to a ball. Dora's aunt and Lady Hayworth suggest she seduce Albert, while Vanessa will charm his eldest brother, Edward, set to inherit the title of viscount. At the ball, her vision becomes true, but the blood ends up being just spilled punch. Vanessa reveals Dora's secret to the royal magician, hoping he might find a cure. Elias promises to help, but he is also preoccupied with a sleeping plague that is afflicting children in the workhouses.\nTo elude the ladies' strict control, Elias fakes interest in Dora and gives her an enchanted mirror, which allows her to contact him.

She was a founding member of the Australian Tonalist movement and part of the Twenty Melbourne Painters Society.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDescribed in a 2009 review by Sasha Grishin as “a South Australian Meldrumite who has been almost totally forgotten,” Mary 'Polly' Hurry in fact was born in Kyneton, Victoria, on 2 May, 1883, daughter of Henry Hurry and Mary Herring and the middle child of two siblings, Maurice and George. She spent her early years there at the family home South Lodge, 29 Donnithorne Street, then was educated at Ruyton Girls' School, Kew.\n\n\n== Training ==\nLater, at the Kyneton School of Mines, Hurry took lessons in drawing and wood carving, then studied watercolour painting with the Scottish-born artist, John Mather. During a camping holiday she met several artists, who like Mather were associates of the tonalist Max Meldrum, and decided to take up art seriously. She began drawing from life at Melbourne's 1859 Old Temple Court building where studios were occupied by students of Frederick McCubbin; Jessie Traill, Dora Wilson, Janet Cumbrae Stewart, Norah Gurdon and AME Bale; before approaching Meldrum to join his studio as one of the first of his pupils, alongside Harry McClelland.\n\n\n== Australian tonalist artist ==\nHurry regarded Meldrum as the most important influence on her artistic development, but the association also shaped her personal life; in Meldrum’s studio she met John Farmer whom she married on 13 August 1921. Farmer (1897-1989) was a close friend of fellow student 10 years younger, Justus Jorgensen, when both attended the National Gallery School in 1914, where he also met Clarice Beckett and Colin Colahan. Brought up in a large family in Brunswick, Farmer worked as a scenery painter for J.C. Williamson Ltd. Richard McCullin, a drawing master at the Gallery School, suggested that students might be interested in going to hear a lecture in 1917 by controversial young painter, Max Meldrum, who argued that \"the art of painting is a pure science - the science of optical analysis.\"\n\nHurry became a founding member of the original Twenty Melbourne Painters Society — Jas Stuart Anderson, Alice Bale, Elsie Barlow, Alexander Colquhoun, George Colville, Edith Downing, Bernice Edwell, William Frater, Henrietta Maria Gulliver, Carl Hampel, C.E. James, Richard McCann, Bertha Merfield, A.E. Newbury, Clara Southern, Ruth Sutherland, Jo Sweatman,  Isobel Tweddle, and Rose A. Walker  — all supporters and students of Meldrum, which split from The Victorian Artists Society in protest at his defeat in the 1918 election for its president. In 1919, the breakaway group held their first exhibition. Twenty Melbourne Painters Society founding Secretary A.M.E. Bale declared:“We desire nothing but sincerity and a humble study of nature, from which alone all art, whether decorative or realistic, draws any enduring life.”\nAlso in 1921, Hurry entered the inaugural Archibald Prize, in which 41 works were submitted and all exhibited from 17 January 1922 for two months. The Prize was awarded to WB McInnes, but no catalogue for the 1921 exhibition has been found, and the subject of the work submitted by Hurry is not known. \nThe couple shared one of the purpose-built studios (Studio 2) at the 1888 Grosvenor Chambers, 9 Collins Street, Melbourne (its name a direct reference to Grosvenor Gallery of London) occupied also at various times by Meldrum, Tom Roberts, Frederick McCubbin, Arthur Streeton, Percival Ball, Charles Francis Summers, Clara Southern, Jane Sutherland, Charles Conder, E. Phillips Fox, John Longstaff, Girolamo Nerli, Louis Abrahams, Rose Walker, George Lambert, and Ola Cohn. Frequent visitors to the studio were Janet Cumbrae Stewart, Norah Gurdon, Dora L. Wilson (who also had a studio in the building), Jessie Traill, Norah Wilkie and Margaret Pestell.\n\n\n== Asia ==\nFor their honeymoon the Farmers left via Hong Kong for China, visiting Sha\nThe Dora Mavor Moore Awards (also known as the Dora Awards or the Doras) are awards presented annually by the Toronto Alliance for the Performing Arts (TAPA), honouring theatre, dance and opera productions in Toronto.

Each of these major categories is further sub-divided in an assorted number of awards. In 2018, the awards announced that beginning with the 2019 awards, it would discontinue gender-based performance categories, replacing its previous performance categories for men and women with \"Outstanding Performance\" categories.\n\n\n== Ancillary awards ==\nIn association with the Dora Awards, several ancillary awards are also administered and presented by TAPA.\nAlthough the Doras were cancelled in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada shutting down theatre production in the 2020-21 season, ancillary awards were still presented that year as they are presented for the recipient's overall body of work rather than for specific shows within an eligibility period.\n\n\n=== Pauline McGibbon Award ===\nThis award was established in 1981 in honour of former Lieutenant Governor of Ontario Pauline McGibbon.

In the early 1930s she focused on historical scenes from Melbourne's history, with an exhibition entitled 'Milestones of Melbourne' held at the Fine Art Society Gallery in March 1935. Her work was received favorably by Arthur Streeton for being \"fresh in colour and treatment and free from the depressing appearance of black paint.\" In 1937 she joined and exhibited with Robert Menzies' Australian Academy of Art."

Anti-war protests led to some women, such as Adela Pankhurst being arrested for public disturbance.\nNevertheless, despite this involvement, women have never occupied a central position in the Australian version of the Anzac legend, although since the 1970s their role has been examined in more detail as a result of the emergence of feminist historiography, and specialist histories such as the history of nursing."
