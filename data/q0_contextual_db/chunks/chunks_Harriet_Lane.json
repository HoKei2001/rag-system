        "content": "Harriet Rebecca Lane Johnston (May 9, 1830 – July 3, 1903) was the nineteenth first lady of the United States during the administration of her uncle, lifelong bachelor president James Buchanan, from 1857 to 1861. She has been described as the first of the modern first ladies, being a notably charming and diplomatic hostess, whose dress-styles were copied, and who promoted deserving causes. In her will, she left funds for a new school on the grounds of Washington National Cathedral. Several ships have been named in her honor, including the cutter USCGC Harriet Lane, still in service.\n\n\n== Status ==\nLane is the only person to have served as First Lady to a bachelor president, Buchanan being the only U.S. president never to have married. She is among 11 women who have served as First Lady, but were not married to the president, with most of the other women being relatives of widowed presidents.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHarriet Lane's family was from Franklin County, Pennsylvania.  She was the youngest child of Elliott Tole Lane, a merchant, and Jane Ann Buchanan Lane. She lost her mother when she was nine; when her father's death two years later made her an orphan, she requested that her favorite uncle, James Buchanan, be appointed as her legal guardian. Buchanan, an unmarried Democratic senator from Pennsylvania, indulged his niece and her sister, enrolling them in boarding schools in Charles Town, Virginia (later for two years at the Georgetown Visitation Monastery in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C.). By this time, Buchanan was Secretary of State, and, as he had promised, he introduced her to fashionable and political circles.\nIn 1854, she joined him in London, where he was minister to the Court of St. James's. Queen Victoria gave \"dear Miss Lane\" the rank of ambassador's wife; admiring suitors gave her the fame of a beauty. In appearance \"Hal\" Lane was of medium height, with masses of light, almost golden-colored hair. She had eyes that were described as \"violet colored\".\n\n\n== Acting First Lady of the United States ==\nThe capital welcomed its new \"Democratic Queen\" to the White House in 1857. Harriet was a popular hostess during the four years of the Buchanan presidency. Women copied her hair and clothing styles (especially when she lowered the neckline on her inaugural gown by 2.5 inches), parents named their daughters for her, and a popular song (\"Listen to the Mockingbird\") was dedicated to her. While in the White House, she used her position to promote social causes, such as improving the living conditions of Native Americans in reservations. She also made a point of inviting artists and musicians to White House functions. For both her popularity and her advocacy work, she has been described as the first of the modern first ladies, and her popularity at the time is compared to that of Jacqueline Kennedy in the 1960s. The presidential yacht was named for her—the first of several ships to be named after her, one of which remains in service.\n\nAs sectional tensions increased, she worked out seating arrangements for her weekly formal dinner parties with special care, to give dignitaries their proper precedence and still keep political foes apart. Her tact did not falter, but her task became impossible—as did her uncle's. Seven states had seceded by the time Buchanan retired from office and returned with his niece to his spacious country home, Wheatland, near Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\nIn the 1982 Siena College Research Institute survey asking historians to assess American first ladies, Lane and several other \"acting\" first ladies were included. The first ladies survey, which has been conducted periodically since, ranks first ladies according to a cumulative score on the independent criteria of their background, value to the country, intelligence, courage, accomplishments, integrity, leadership, being their own women, public image, and value to the president. In the 1982 survey, out of 42 first ladies and acting first ladies,\nHarriet Lane was a revenue cutter of the United States Revenue Cutter Service and, on the outbreak of the American Civil War, a ship of the United States Navy and later Confederate States Navy. The craft was named after the niece of senator and later United States President, James Buchanan; during his presidency, she acted as First Lady. The cutter was christened and entered the water for the Revenue Service in 1859 out of New York City, and saw action during the Civil War at Fort Sumter, New Orleans, Galveston, Texas, and Virginia Point. The Confederates captured her in 1863, whereupon she was converted to mercantile service. Union forces recaptured her at the end of war. The U.S. Navy declared her unfit for service and sold her. New owners out of Philadelphia renamed her Elliot Ritchie. Her crew abandoned her at sea in 1881.\n\n\n== Layout of the ship ==\n \nHarriet Lane measured 177.5 feet long, 30.5 feet wide and 12 feet from the bottom of the hull to the main deck. Her propulsion was a double-right-angled marine engine with two side paddles, supported by two masts; the entire ship was sheathed and fastened with copper. From stern to bow, the captain's cabin and stateroom sat above an aft magazine, forward of which was a second magazine with the officer quarters above. Forward of this, in the midships was the engine machinery and coal supply, and beyond this the quarters and galley for the non-commissioned ranks which sat above a third magazine. Her initial armaments were described as \"light guns\", however after joining the West Gulf Squadron her firepower was upgraded somewhat: one four-inch rifled Parrott gun to the forecastle, one nine-inch Dahlgren gun before the first mast, two eight-inch Dahlgren Columbiads and two twenty-four-pound brass howitzers. Her crew of 95 were also issued small arms.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== With the Union ===\n\nHarriet Lane, built for the Treasury Department by William H. Webb, was launched in New York City, in November 1857. She was a copper-plated steamer that could make speeds of up to eleven knots. Her battery consisted of three thirty-two-pounders and four twenty-four-pound howitzers. She served as a revenue cutter until temporarily transferred to the Navy late in 1858. Her new assignment took her to Paraguay with a squadron ordered to support the discussions of U.S. Special Commissioner James B. Bowlin with Dictator Carlos Antonio López concerning reparations for damages incurred during an attack on Water Witch by a Paraguayan fort, February 1, 1855. This display of sea power quickly won the United States a prompt and respectful hearing which four years of diplomacy had failed to obtain. Paraguay paid a modest indemnity to compensate the family of an American seaman killed during the fight. In his report, Flag Officer William B. Shubrick singled out Harriet Lane for special commendation on the invaluable service she rendered in extricating his other ships that repeatedly ran aground in the treacherous waters of the Paraná River.\n\nReturning to the United States, Harriet Lane resumed her former duties as a revenue cutter. Captain John A. Faunce, USRCS was commanding officer. In September 1860 she embarked Edward Albert, Prince of Wales, the first member of the British Royal Family to visit the United States, for passage to Mount Vernon, where he planted a tree and placed a wreath on the tomb of George Washington.\nUSRC Harriet Lane again transferred to the Navy on March 30, 1861, for service in the expedition sent to Charleston, South Carolina, to supply the Fort Sumter garrison after the outbreak of the American Civil War. She departed New York April 8 and arrived off Charleston April 11. On the evening of the 11th, the Harriet Lane fired on the civilian steamship Nashville when that merchantman appeared with no colors flying. Nashville avoided further attack by promptly hoisting the United States ensign. When Major Robert Anderson surrendered Fort Sumter 13 April, Harriet Lane withdrew with her \nUSCGC Harriet Lane refers to three ships of the United States Coast Guard:\n\nUSRC Harriet Lane (1857), a revenue cutter serving in the United States Revenue Cutter Service 1861–1881\nUSCGC Harriet Lane (WSC-141), a 125-foot cutter in service with the Coast Guard 1926–1946\nUSCGC Harriet Lane (WMEC-903), a medium-endurance cutter active in service with the Coast Guard, commissioned 1984\nHarriet Lane Levy (March 29, 1866 – September 15, 1950) was a California writer best known for her memoir, 920 O’Farrell Street. Levy was also an avid art collector, a childhood friend of Alice B. Toklas, and an acquaintance of Gertrude Stein.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nLevy was born on March 29, 1866, in San Francisco, California, into an upper middle-class Polish-Jewish family. Her parents, Benjamin \"Benish\" and Henriette \"Yetta\" Levy, raised her, along with her sisters Addie and Polly, in the city at 920 O'Farrell Street which would become the topic of her memoir.\nYoung women such as Levy were expected to marry well-off men, which generated additional societal expectations. However, the intellectually inclined Levy was hesitant to marry early. Although her parents encouraged her to pursue an education, they also wanted her to follow 19th-century gender conventions. Levy's family was religiously observant and likely attended Sherith Israel Temple in San Francisco, but Levy later left the Jewish faith, along with her friend Sarah Stein, in favor of Christian Science.\nLevy graduated from Girls' High School and then enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley at 16. For her entrance exam, she translated Heinrich Heine's poem \"Die Lorelei\" from German to English for Josiah Royce. She graduated from the university in 1886.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter graduating, Levy became a prominent writer for popular local publications, such as the San Francisco Call. She also wrote for The Wave, a San Francisco weekly, with notable writers such as Jack London and Frank Norris. In 1906, Harriet was across the San Francisco Bay when a large earthquake struck the city, and when she returned she found the house at 920 O'Farrell street completely destroyed.\nWhen she was 40, Levy traveled to Paris in 1907 along with Sarah Stein and Alice B. Toklas, two friends who also had lived on O'Farrell Street. There they met up with more of Sarah's family, including Gertrude Stein, who Toklas fell in love with.\nIn 1908, in Paris, Levy was invited to Pablo Picasso's party in the Montmartre in and Montparnasse quarters, to honor the painter Henri Rousseau. Levy wrote a description of the famed Rousseau Banquet, which was published in a limited edition of 30 copies in 1985 as part of a UC Berkeley seminar.\nOne of Gertrude Stein's early word portraits was dedicated to Levy. Levy became the center of considerable effort on the part of Toklas and Stein to ensure her return to San Francisco, this time without Toklas, her original traveling companion.\nLevy moved to Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, in 1943 during World War II and resided at the La Playa Hotel with her companion Mary Godde.\nAt the age of 80, Levy's autobiography, 920 O’Farrell Street, was published. The book chronicles her childhood in an upper-middle-class San Francisco neighborhood, offering a glimpse into her early life experiences. A volume of the verse, I Love to Talk About Myself, was published the same year.\n\n\n== Death ==\nHarriet Levy died on September 15, 1950. A number of her unpublished manuscripts are housed at Berkeley's Bancroft Library, and some recollections from her travels in Paris were published posthumously as Paris Portraits: Stories of Picasso, Matisse, Gertrude Stein, and Their Circle.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of the Jews in San Francisco\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFour short radio readings from 920 O'Farrell Street from California Legacy Project.\nThe Right of the People to Peaceably Assemble in Unusual Clothing (pdf file; with selections from Harriet Lane Levy's autobiography)\nReview and Summary of Harriet Lane Levy's autobiography\nExample of bequest by Harriet Lane Levy to the San Francisco Museum of Art.\nUSCGC Harriet Lane (WMEC-903) is a United States Coast Guard medium endurance cutter. Named after Harriet Lane, niece and official hostess of President James Buchanan. Harriet Lane was constructed by Tacoma Boatbuilding, Tacoma, Washington and delivered 20 April 1984.\n\n\n== History ==\nHarriet Lane was commissioned on 14 June 1984 and has served the Coast Guard and the nation with distinction, for example, by conducting Coast Guard and national defense missions from Maine to South America and even into the Pacific Northwest.  In 1994, as the Commander of Operation Able Manner forces, she directed the rescue of thousands of Haitian and Cuban migrants flowing across the Windward Passage and Florida Straits toward U.S. shores.  During this mass migration, Harriet Lane's crew saved over 2,400 migrants, directed 15 cutters, an aerostat and multiple aircraft.  She has twice been a key U.S. participant in the annual UNITAS multi-national exercise with South American navies in 1994 and 1997. In 1995, Harriet Lane conducted a trial Alaska patrol to determine the feasibility of placing a medium-endurance cutter in the Seventeenth District.\nIn 1996, Harriet Lane was the on scene commander for much of the initial search and recovery of TWA Flight 800 off Long Island.  She escorted an international fleet of tall ships during the OPSAIL 2000 Parade of Sail.  Most recently, exhibiting the Coast Guard's multi-mission nature and typical of Harriet Lane's twenty years of service, she stood as a maritime security sentry in Charleston, South Carolina Harbor for the Operation Iraqi Freedom load-out, then moved south to the Caribbean and seized two tons of cocaine headed for the U.S., and finally, rescued several hundred migrants attempting to reach the U.S. in unseaworthy boats.[1]\nIn May 2010, Harriet Lane was directly involved in response efforts of the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico after the major explosion that sank the rig. This was considered the worst environmental disaster in US history.[2]\n\n\n== Indo-Pacific Support Cutter ==\nIn March 2023, the U.S. Coast Guard announced that Harriet Lane will be transferred to the Indo-Pacific in late 2023 as an 'Indo-Pacific Support Cutter'. Harriet Lane completed a 15 month, $21 million Service Life Extension Program at the Coast Guard Yard in Baltimore on 3 August 2023. Among other work, a 25mm Mk 38 Mod 3 gun was installed. In mid-December 2023, Harriet Lane arrived in her new home port of Honolulu, Hawai'i to begin work as part of U.S. Coast Guard District 14.\nIn June 2024, she embarked on a 68-day mission covering 13,400 nautical miles, visiting and training with government partners in Tuvalu, Tonga, Samoa and the Cook Islands, including participating in an international fleet review in honor of Tongan King Tupou VI's 65th Birthday and the 50th anniversary of the Royal Tongan Navy. She joined 11 ships from 10 countries in Nuku’alofa including Australia's HMAS Choules, China’s PLA-N Zibo, Japan’s JS Noshiro, New Zealand’s HMNZS Manawanui, UK's HMS Tamar, with Tonga's VOEA Ngahau Koula serving as the King's flagship.\n\n\n== Notable commanders ==\nPaul F.

The hospital has 196 pediatric beds and is affiliated with the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. The hospital is the flagship pediatric member of Johns Hopkins Medicine and is one of two children's hospitals in the network. The hospital provides comprehensive pediatric specialties and subspecialties to infants, children, teens, and young adults aged 0–21 throughout Baltimore and the wider United States. Johns Hopkins Children's Center also sometimes treats adults who require pediatric care. Johns Hopkins Children's Center also features the only ACS verified Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center in the state. The hospital is directly attached to Johns Hopkins Hospital and is situated near the Ronald McDonald House of Maryland.\n\n\n== History ==\nPediatrics at Johns Hopkins originated in 1912 when the original Harriet Lane Home for Invalid Children opened. The new hospital was set to be named after Baltimore resident Harriet Lane Johnston after she donated $400,000 in 1903 to establish the home as a memorial to her two sons who had died in childhood. After a few years of building, the building opened in October 1912. Harriet Lane Home for Invalid Children was the first children's clinic in the United States that was associated with a medical school.\nAt the time, most children were seen in the same facilities as adults, and pediatrics was just a subspecialty of general medicine. The new care model that Johns Hopkins pioneered became the industry standard for pediatrics in the United States. Eventually treating over 60,000 children a year, the Harriet Lane Home became a pioneer treatment, teaching, and research clinic, and the first to have subspecialties in pediatrics as created by Edwards A. Park.\nFrom 1930 to 1963 Helen Taussig, who helped to develop the blue baby operation, headed the pediatric cardiac clinic. Child psychiatrist Leo Kanner did studies of autistic children. Lawson Wilkins established an endocrine clinic that developed procedures used universally to treat children with certain glandular disorders, including dwarfism. John E. Bordley and William G. Hardy made strides in detecting hearing impairments in very young children.\nIn 1964, the Children's Medical & Surgical Center (CMSC) opened on the Johns Hopkins campus to better provide patient care to their pediatric patients. The addition meant that for the first time, parents were able to sleep in the same room as their children, a rare occurrence for children's hospitals at the time. After the new Charlotte R. Bloomberg Children's Center opened in 2012, the CMSC was decommissioned and turned into a laboratory space and space to simulate a hospital environment for trainees. Plans have also been made to construct a new facade and renovate the CMSC to house more research programs.\nIn May 2012, the Johns Hopkins Hospital opened two new towers as part of a major campus redevelopment effort. The opening of the new $1.1 billion Charlotte R. Bloomberg Children's Center tower and the new adult Sheikh Zayed Tower marked the high point of this effort. The tower provides 560,000 square feet and many new modern amenities. The new towers featured colorful exteriors designed by artist Spencer Finch, and general design from the design firm, Perkins and Will.\nCharlotte R. Bloomberg Children's Center got its name when former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg donated $120 million to the construction of the new children's tower.\n\n\n== About ==\nThe hospital has an American Academy of Pediatrics verified level IV neonatal intensive care unit that has a capacity of 45 bassinets. The hospital has a 40-bed pediatric intensive care unit for critical pediatric patients age 0-21. The hospital also features 10 operating rooms.\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nJohns Hopkins Children's Center is regularly regarded as a national l\nMary Ann Todd Lincoln (December 13, 1818 – July 16, 1882) served as the First Lady of the United States from 1861 until the assassination of her husband, President Abraham Lincoln, in 1865.\nMary Todd was born into a large and wealthy slave-owning  family in Kentucky, although Mary never owned slaves and in her adulthood came to oppose slavery. Well educated, after finishing-school in her late teens, she moved to Springfield, the capital of Illinois.  She lived there with her married sister Elizabeth Todd Edwards, the wife of an Illinois congressman. Before she married Abraham Lincoln, Mary was courted by his long-time political opponent Stephen A. Douglas. \nMary Lincoln staunchly supported her husband's career and political ambitions and throughout his presidency she was active in keeping national morale high during the Civil War. She acted as the White House social coordinator, throwing lavish balls and redecorating the White House at great expense; her spending was the source of much consternation. She was seated next to Abraham when he was assassinated in the President's Box at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., on April 14, 1865. \nThe Lincolns had four sons of whom only the eldest, Robert, survived both parents. The deaths of her husband and three of her sons weighed heavily on her. Young Thomas (Tad) who died suddenly in 1871, had just spent extended time traveling with her, after Robert married. Mary Lincoln suffered with physical and mental health issues. She had frequent migraines, which were exacerbated by a head injury in 1863. She likely suffered with depression or possibly bipolar disorder. She was briefly institutionalized for psychiatric illness in 1875, and then spent several years traveling in Europe.  She later retired to the home of her sister in Springfield, where she died in 1882 at age 63.  She is buried with her husband and three younger sons in the Lincoln Tomb, a National Historic Landmark.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\n\nTodd was born in Lexington, Kentucky, as the fourth of seven children of Robert Smith Todd, a banker, and Elizabeth \"Eliza\" (Parker) Todd.  When she was six, her mother died in childbirth. Two years later, her father married Elizabeth \"Betsy\" Humphreys and they had nine children together. Todd had a difficult relationship with her stepmother.\nFrom 1832, Mary and her family lived in what is now known as the Mary Todd Lincoln House, an elegant 14-room residence at 578 West Main Street in Lexington.\nMary's paternal great-grandfather, David Levi Todd, was born in County Longford, Ireland, and immigrated through Pennsylvania to Kentucky. Another great-grandfather, Andrew Porter, was the son of an Irish immigrant to New Hampshire and later Pennsylvania. Her great-great maternal grandfather Samuel McDowell was born in Scotland, and emigrated to Pennsylvania. Other Todd ancestors came from England.\nAt an early age Mary was sent to Madame Mentelle's finishing school, where the curriculum concentrated on French and literature. She learned to speak French fluently and studied dance, drama, music, and social graces. By age 20, she was regarded as witty and gregarious with a grasp of politics. Like her family, she was a Whig.\nMary began living with her sister Elizabeth Porter Edwards in Springfield, Illinois, in October 1839. Elizabeth was married to Ninian W. Edwards, son of a former governor. He  served as Mary's guardian. Mary was popular among the gentry of Springfield, and though she was courted by the rising young lawyer and Democratic Party politician Stephen A. Douglas and others, she chose Abraham Lincoln, a fellow Whig.\n\n\n== Marriage and family ==\n\nMary Todd married Abraham Lincoln on November 4, 1842, at her sister Elizabeth's home in Springfield. She was 23 years old and he was 33 years of age.\nTheir four sons, all born in Springfield, Illinois, were:\n\nRobert Todd Lincoln (1843–1926), lawyer, diplomat (U.S. Secretary of War), businessman\nEdward Baker Lincoln, known as \"Eddie\" (1846–1\nHarriet Lane Huntress (November 30, 1860 - July 31, 1922) was an American civil servant. She served as the Deputy Superintendent of Public Instruction in New Hampshire, being the first woman in New England appointed to such a position. She was also prominent in the civic and social life of the state. The Harriet Lane Huntress dormitory for female students at Keene Normal School (now Keene State College) was named in her honor.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHarriet Lane Huntress was born in Meredith (now Center Harbor, New Hampshire), November 30, 1860. She was the daughter of James Lewis and Harriet Perkins (Page) Huntress. Her father was the proprietor of the Senter House, a summer resort on Lake Winnipesaukee. Huntress came from sturdy stock. Her ancestors were among the first settlers of New Hampshire, coming from the North of Ireland of Scotch ancestry, and for generation after generation became prominent people in the locality where they lived. This was so on both sides of her lineage. They were all New Hampshire people and remained there with very few exceptions. Molly Stark was kin. \nHuntress was educated in private schools in Massachusetts, graduating from Prospect Hill School, Greenfield, in 1879. She had regrets about the private school education, often having expressed the feeling that if she had attended a public school it would have been of assistance to her in the work of her life.\nFrom 1879, she resided in Concord, New Hampshire. In 1889, she began a connection with the state department of public instruction. She served as chief clerk of the New Hampshire Department of Public Instruction, from April of that year, serving under Superintendents Patterson, Gowing, Folsom and Morrison. In September 1913, she was appointed deputy superintendent, being the first woman in New England appointed to such position, and continuing in the role until her death. In 1919, she was particularly zealous and successful in the then proposed Educational Act for New Hampshire. She showed great enthusiasm in helping put it into effect; and with initiative, resourcefulness and admirable workmanship, developed her department in the new system. \nHunter developed the index used in the 1903 edition of the history of Concord.\nIn 1920, in recognition of her services to the cause of education, New Hampshire College conferred upon her the honorary degree of Master of Arts.\nHuntress was an active worker in the New Hampshire Equal Suffrage Association (member, advisory board), and a faithful supporter of the Unitarian church. She was a member of the Concord Woman's Club, Country Club, Beaver Meadow Golf Club, Woman's City Club of Boston, New Hampshire Historical Society, Capital Grange, Rumford Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolution, and the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association (vice-regent for New Hampshire), whose work she represented in New Hampshire. \n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\n\nAbsent from her job since February 1922 on account of illness, \nHuntress died at her home in Concord, July 31, 1922. She was mourned throughout the state, and the state schools, with flags flying at half-staff, closed their doors for the day. Her papers are held by the Archives of the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association at the Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington at Mount Vernon.\nConstructed in 1925, Keene Normal School (now Keene State College) honored Huntress by conferring her name to the Harriet Lane Huntress dormitory for female students.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Attribution ===\n This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain:  The Granite State Monthly (1915).

One Thousand New Hampshire Notables: Brief Biographical Sketches of New Hampshire Men and Women, Native Or Resident, Prominent in Public, Professional, Business, Ed\nThe first lady of the United States is the hostess of the White House. The position is traditionally filled by the wife of the president of the United States, but, on occasion, the title has been applied to women who were not presidents' wives, such as when the president was a bachelor or widower, or when the wife of the president was unable to fulfill the duties of the first lady. The first lady is not an elected position; it carries no official duties and receives no salary. Nonetheless, she attends many official ceremonies and functions of state either along with or in place of the president. Traditionally, the first lady does not hold outside employment while occupying the office, although Eleanor Roosevelt earned money writing and giving lectures, but gave most of it to charity, and Jill Biden has maintained her regular job as an educator during her time in the role. The first lady has her own staff, including the White House social secretary, the chief of staff, the press secretary, the chief floral designer, and the executive chef. The Office of the First Lady is also in charge of all social and ceremonial events of the White House, and is a branch of the Executive Office of the President.\nThere have been total of 54 first ladies including 43 official and 11 acting, within 46 first ladyships. This discrepancy exists because some presidents had multiple first ladies. Following Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20, 2021, his wife, Jill Biden, became the 43rd official first lady.\nThere are four living former first ladies: Hillary Clinton, married to Bill Clinton; Laura Bush, married to George W. Bush; Michelle Obama, married to Barack Obama; and Melania Trump, married to Donald Trump. The most recent first lady to die was Rosalynn Carter, married to Jimmy Carter. The first first lady was Martha Washington, married to George Washington. Presidents John Tyler and Woodrow Wilson had two official first ladies; both remarried during their presidential tenures. The wives of four presidents died before their husbands were sworn into office but are still considered first ladies by the White House and National First Ladies' Library: Martha Wayles Skelton, married to Thomas Jefferson; Rachel Jackson, married to Andrew Jackson; Hannah Van Buren, married to Martin Van Buren; and Ellen Lewis Herndon Arthur, married to Chester A. Arthur. One woman who was not married to a president is still considered an official first lady: Harriet Lane, niece of bachelor James Buchanan. The other non-spousal relatives who served as White House hostesses are not recognized by the First Ladies' Library.\nIn 2007, the United States Mint began releasing a set of half-ounce $10 gold coins under the First Spouse Program with engravings of portraits of the first ladies on the obverse. When a president served without a spouse, a gold coin was issued that bears an obverse image emblematic of Liberty as depicted on a circulating coin of that era and a reverse image emblematic of themes of that president's life. This is true for the coins for Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, and James Buchanan's first ladies, but not the coin for Chester A. Arthur's first lady, which instead depicts suffragette Alice Paul.\n\n\n== Current living first ladies ==\nLiving first ladies as of November 2024 (from oldest to youngest):\n\n\n== List ==\nThis list includes all persons who served as first ladies, regardless of whether they were married to the incumbent president or not, as well as persons who are considered first ladies by the official White House website and the White House Historical Association. It is sorted by the name the first ladies were commonly known as.\n\n\n== Other spouses of presidents of the United States ==\nCertain spouses of presidents of the United States are not considered first ladies of the United States.\nFour presidents were widowed prior to their presidencies:\n\nThomas Jefferson was married to Martha Wayles from 1772 until her death in 1782.\nA\nThe Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) is the teaching hospital and biomedical research facility of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. Founded in 1889,  Johns Hopkins Hospital and its school of medicine are considered to be the founding institutions of modern American medicine and the birthplace of numerous famed medical traditions, including rounds, residents, and house staff. Several medical specialties were founded at the hospital, including neurosurgery by Harvey Cushing and Walter Dandy, cardiac surgery by Alfred Blalock and Vivien Thomas, and child psychiatry by Leo Kanner. Johns Hopkins Children's Center, which serves infants, children, teens, and young adults aged 0–21, is attached to the hospital.\nJohns Hopkins Hospital is widely regarded as one of the world's greatest hospitals and medical institutions. For 21 consecutive years from 1991 to 2020, it was ranked as the best overall hospital in the United States by U.S. News & World Report. In its 2019–2020 edition, U.S. News & World Report ranked the hospital on 15 adult specialties and 10 children's specialties; the hospital came in 1st in Maryland and third nationally behind the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. In 2021, the hospital marked 32 consecutive years of placing in the top five hospitals in the nation.\nThe hospital's founding in 1889 was made possible from a philanthropic bequest of over $7 million by city merchant, banker, financier, civic leader, and philanthropist Johns Hopkins, which at the time was the largest bequest in the history of the United States. The hospital is located at 600 North Broadway in Baltimore.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\n\nJohns Hopkins (1795–1873), a Baltimore merchant and banker, left an estate of approximately $7 million (US$173.84 million in 2022) when he died on December 24, 1873, in his city mansion on West Saratoga Street, just west of North Charles Street, at the age of 78. In his will, he asked that his fortune be used to found two institutions that would bear his name: \"Johns Hopkins University\" and \"The Johns Hopkins Hospital.\" At the time that it was made, Hopkins' gift was the largest philanthropic bequest in the history of the nation.\nToward the end of his life, Hopkins selected 12 prominent Baltimore residents as trustees for the project. A year prior to his death, he sent each a letter telling them that he was giving \"thirteen acres of land, situated in the city of Baltimore, and bounded by Broadway, Wolfe, Monument, and Jefferson streets upon which I desire you to erect a hospital.\" He wished for a hospital that \"shall, in construction and arrangement, compare favorably with any other institution of like character in this country or in Europe\" and directed his trustees to \"secure for the service of the Hospital, physicians and surgeons of the highest character and greatest skill.\"\nHopkins instructed the trustees to \"bear constantly in mind that it is my wish and purpose that the hospital shall ultimately form a part of the Medical School of that university for which I have made ample provision in my will.\" By calling for this integral relationship between patient care, as embodied in the hospital, and teaching and research, as embodied in the university, Hopkins laid the groundwork for a revolution in American medicine. Johns Hopkins' vision, of two institutions in which the practice of medicine would be wedded to medical research and medical education was revolutionary.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nInitial plans for the hospital were drafted by surgeon John Shaw Billings, and the architecture designed by John Rudolph Niernsee and completed by Edward Clarke Cabot of the Boston firm of Cabot and Chandler in a Queen Anne style. When completed in 1889 at a cost of $2,050,000 (US$50.8 million in 2022), the hospital included what was then state-of-the-art concepts in heating and ventilation to check the spread of disease.\nThe trustees obtained the services \nHarriet is a female name.\nThe name is an English version of the French Henriette, a female form of Henri. The male name  Harry was formed in a similar way from Henry. All these names are derived from Henrik, which is ultimately derived from the Germanic name Heimiric, derived from the word elements heim, or \"home\" and ric, meaning \"power, ruler\". The male name Henry was first used in England by Normans. Popular nicknames for Harriet or Harriett include Hallie, Hattie, Hatty, Hetty, Hettie, Hennie, Harolda, Harry, Harri, Harrie, and Etta or Ettie. The name can be lengthened to Harrietta, Henriette, or Henrietta.\nThe name was the 73rd most popular name for baby girls born in England and Wales in 2007. It last ranked in the top 1,000 most popular names for girls in the United States in the 1960s.\n\n\n== Variants ==\n\n\n== As a given name ==\nHarriet Adams (1892–1982), American juvenile novelist\nHarriet Chalmers Adams (1875-1937), American writer, explorer and photographer\nHarriet Ryan Albee (1829-1873), American social reformer and philanthropist\nHarriet Andersson (born 1937), Swedish actress\nHarriet Arbuthnot (1793–1834), English diarist, social observer, and political hostess\nHarriett Ellen Grannis Arey (1819-1901), American educator, author, editor, publisher\nHarriet Pritchard Arnold (1858-1901), American author\nHarriet Auber (1773–1862), English poet, hymnwriter\nHarriet Backer (1845-1932), Norwegian painter\nHarriett Baldwin (born 1960), British politician\nHarriett Ball (1941-2011), American educator who inspired the KIPP program\nHarriet Bates (1856-1886), American novelist, poet\nHarriet Bibby (born 1998), English actress\nHarriet Blackstone (1864–1939), American artist\nHarriet Bland (1915-1991), Olympic gold medal-winning sprinter\nHarriet Bosse (1878–1961), Swedish-Norwegian actress\nHarriet Boyd-Hawes (1871–1945), American archaeologist\nHarriet G.

Buchanan also served as the secretary of state from 1845 to 1849 and represented Pennsylvania in both houses of the U.S. Congress. He was an advocate for states' rights, particularly regarding slavery, and minimized the role of the federal government preceding the Civil War.\nBuchanan was a lawyer in Pennsylvania and won his first election to the state's House of Representatives as a Federalist. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1820 and retained that post for five terms, aligning with Andrew Jackson's Democratic Party. Buchanan served as Jackson's minister to Russia in 1832. He won the election in 1834 as a U.S. senator from Pennsylvania and continued in that position for 11 years. He was appointed to serve as President James K. Polk's secretary of state in 1845, and eight years later was named as President Franklin Pierce's minister to the United Kingdom.\nBeginning in 1844, Buchanan became a regular contender for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination. He was nominated and won the 1856 presidential election. As President, Buchanan intervened to assure the Supreme Court's majority ruling in the pro-slavery decision in the Dred Scott case. He acceded to Southern attempts to engineer Kansas' entry into the Union as a slave state under the Lecompton Constitution, and angered not only Republicans but also Northern Democrats. Buchanan honored his pledge to serve only one term and supported Breckinridge's unsuccessful candidacy in the 1860 presidential election. He failed to reconcile the fractured Democratic Party amid the grudge against Stephen Douglas, leading to the election of Republican and former Congressman Abraham Lincoln.\nBuchanan's leadership during his lame duck period, before the American Civil War, has been widely criticized. He simultaneously angered the North by not stopping secession and the South by not yielding to their demands. He supported the Corwin Amendment in an effort to reconcile the country. He made an unsuccessful attempt to reinforce Fort Sumter, but otherwise refrained from preparing the military. In his personal life, Buchanan never married and was the only U.S. president to remain a lifelong bachelor, leading some historians and authors to question his sexual orientation. His failure to forestall the Civil War has been described as incompetence, and he spent his last years defending his reputation. Historians and scholars rank Buchanan as among the worst presidents in American history.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\n\n=== Childhood and education ===\nJames Buchanan Jr. was born into a Scottish-Irish family on April 23, 1791, in a log cabin on a farm called Stony Batter, near Cove Gap, Peters Township, in the Allegheny Mountains of southern Pennsylvania. He was the last president born in the 18th century and, until the election of Joe Biden in 2020, the only one born in Pennsylvania. Buchanan was the second of eleven children with six sisters and four brothers, and the eldest son of James Buchanan Sr. (1761–1821) and his wife Elizabeth Speer (1767–1833). James Buchanan Sr., was an Ulster-Scot from just outside Ramelton, a small town in the north-east of County Donegal in the north-west of Ulster, the northern province in Ireland, who emigrated to the newly formed United States in 1783, having sailed from Derry. He belonged to the Clan Buchanan, whose members had emigrated in large numbers from the Scottish Highlands to Ulster in the north of Ireland during the Plantation of Ulster in the seventeenth century and, later, largely because of poverty and persecution by the Crown due to their Presbyterian faith, had further emigrated in large numbers from Ulster to America from the early eighteenth century onwards. Shortly after Buchanan's birth, the family relocated to a farm near Mercersburg, Pennsylvania, and later settled in the town in 1794. His father \nFirst Lady of the United States (FLOTUS) is a title typically held by the wife of the president of the United States, concurrent with the president's term in office. Although the first lady's role has never been codified or officially defined, she figures prominently in the political and social life of the United States. The First Lady of the United States is the hostess of the White House.\nHistorically, when a president has been unmarried or a widower, he has usually asked a relative to act as White House hostess. Since the early 20th century, the first lady has been assisted by official staff, known as the Office of the First Lady and headquartered in the East Wing of the White House. Jill Biden has served as the first lady of the United States since 2021, being the wife of the 46th president, Joe Biden. Jill Biden is also one of twelve  second ladies to have gone on to become first ladies during their spouses' terms as president. While the title was not in general use until much later, Martha Washington, the wife of George Washington, the first U.S. president (1789–1797), is the first First Lady of the United States. During her lifetime, she was often referred to as \"Lady Washington\".\nSince the 1900s, the role of first lady has changed considerably. It has come to include involvement in political campaigns, management of the White House, championship of social causes, and representation of the president at official and ceremonial occasions. Additionally, over the years individual first ladies have held influence in a range of sectors, from fashion to public opinion on policy, as well as advocacy for female empowerment.\n\n\n== Origins of the title ==\n\nThe use of the title First Lady to describe the spouse or hostess of an executive began in the United States. In the early days of the republic, there was not a generally accepted title for the wife of the president. Many early first ladies expressed their own preference for how they were addressed, including the use of such titles as \"Lady\", \"Mrs. President\" and \"Mrs. Presidentress\"; Martha Washington was often referred to as \"Lady Washington\". One of the earliest uses of the term \"First Lady\" was applied to her in an 1838 newspaper article that appeared in the St. Johnsbury Caledonian, the author, \"Mrs. Sigourney\", discusses how Martha Washington had not changed, even after her husband George became president. She wrote that \"The first lady of the nation still preserved the habits of early life. Indulging in no indolence, she left the pillow at dawn, and after breakfast, retired to her chamber for an hour for the study of the scriptures and devotion.\"\n\nAccording to popular belief, Dolley Madison was referred to as first lady in 1849 at her funeral in a eulogy delivered by President Zachary Taylor; however, no written record of this eulogy exists, nor did any of the newspapers of her day refer to her by that title. Sometime after 1849, the title began being used in Washington, D.C., social circles. The first person to have the title applied to her while she was actually holding the office was Harriet Lane, the niece of James Buchanan; Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper used the phrase to describe her in an 1860 article about her duties as White House hostess. Another of the earliest known written examples comes from a November 3, 1863, diary entry of William Howard Russell, in which he referred to gossip about \"the First Lady in the Land\", referring to Mary Todd Lincoln. The title first gained nationwide recognition in 1877, when newspaper journalist Mary C. Ames referred to Lucy Webb Hayes as \"the First Lady of the Land\" while reporting on the inauguration of Rutherford B. Hayes. The frequent reporting on Lucy Hayes' activities helped spread use of the title outside Washington. A popular 1911 comedic play about Dolley Madison by playwright Charles Nirdlinger, titled The First Lady in the Land, popularized the title further. By the 1930s, it was in wide use. Use of the title later s\nAnne-Marie Duff (born 8 October 1970) is an English actress and narrator. \nAfter graduating from Drama Centre London, Duff made television appearances in Trial & Retribution, Amongst Women and Aristocrats in the late 1990s. She made her breakthrough as Fiona Gallagher on the Channel 4 drama series Shameless and as Queen Elizabeth I in The Virgin Queen; both earned her BAFTA nominations for Best Actress. She was awarded the BAFTA Cymru Award for Best Actress for her work in the 2007 television film The History of Mr Polly. Further television roles include Claire Church in From Darkness (2015), Ma Costa in the BBC and HBO series His Dark Materials (2019), Erin Wiley in Sex Education (2020–2021), Tracy Daszkiewicz in The Salisbury Poisonings (2020) and Grace Williams in Apple TV+ series Bad Sisters (2022–present); earning her a British Academy Television Award for Best Supporting Actress for the latter.\nIn film, Duff has had roles in Enigma (2001), The Magdalene Sisters (2002), Notes on a Scandal (2006), French Film (2008), The Last Station (2009) and Nowhere Boy (2009), alongside Shameless co-star David Threlfall; the latter earned her a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. She later appeared in Before I Go to Sleep (2014) and Suffragette (2015).\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nDuff was born in London on 8 October 1970, the younger of two children of Irish immigrants: her father, a painter and decorator at Fuller's Brewery in Chiswick, was from County Meath and her mother was from County Donegal and worked in a shoe shop. The family lived in Southall, London, and Duff attended Mellow Lane School. While at school, she joined the school choir, where she discovered she could 'really sing'. She paid for singing lessons with a woman who taught classical singing, who made a huge impact. Duff initially thought about pursuing a career as a singer and talked about it in great depth with her teacher, who looked at her and said, 'I think you have the soul of an actor.' At an early age, Duff attended a local youth theatre, Young Argosy, linked to the Argosy Players, in order to battle her shy nature; she soon became hooked on the stage. After further study of Film and Theatre, at the age of 19, she attended the Drama Centre in London, alongside John Simm, Anastasia Hille and her good friend Paul Bettany.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Screen work ===\nDuff made her first television appearance in ITV drama Trial & Retribution as Cathy Gillingham for two episodes in 1997. She later made appearances in series such as Amongst Women, in Aristocrats as Lady Louisa Lennox and in 2003 BBC television film Charles II: The Power and the Passion as Henrietta of England. She first came to the attention of the British public in 2002 for her work playing Margaret in The Magdalene Sisters. She also had a minor role in Holby City as Alison McCarthy. Duff played \nHolly in the first series of Simon Nye sitcom, Wild West, alongside Dawn French and Catherine Tate in 2002. In 2002, Duff appeared in her first major film role as Margaret McGuire in The Magdalene Sisters.\nDuff's first critical acclaim came for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth I in the lavish 2005 BBC television miniseries The Virgin Queen, which also starred Tom Hardy, Emilia Fox and Sienna Guillory. For Elizabeth I, she was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress in both 2006 and 2007. \nFollowing her breakthrough, Duff ventured into films, first appearing in Notes on a Scandal, alongside Judi Dench. After film roles in Irish film Garage and The Waiting Room, she next appeared in a main role in comedy film French Film and Is Anybody There? in 2008. In 2009, Duff received further attention when she played the mother of John Lennon, Julia Stanley, a role for which she won British Independent Film Award for Best Supporting Actress in Nowhere Boy. She also appeared in The Last Station, a biopic about Leo Tolstoy's later years, in which she played his d\nThe USCGC Harriet Lane (WSC-141) was a 125-foot patrol boat, commonly known as a \"buck-and-a-quarter\", 1926–1946.\nShe was the second ship named for Harriet Lane.

Freud (6 April 1892 – 7 April 1970) was an Austrian-born British architect and the fourth child of Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud and his German-born wife Martha Bernays. In honour of his wife, Ernst Freud added the initial L. to his name when he married in early 1920, making the middle initial stand for Lucie and not Ludwig as is often assumed.\n\n\n== Life ==\nFreud was born in Vienna. In 1920, he established his practice in Berlin, where a large number of his clients were doctors. The majority of his commissions were for houses and consulting rooms and he worked in an Art Deco style but by 1930 had begun to work in a modern style showing the influence of Mies van der Rohe. Examples of this include a cigarette factory in Berlin and a house for Dr. Frank in Geltow near Potsdam. Dr. Frank was a manager of Deutsche Bank until he was forced to give up his position in 1933 and into exile in 1938.\nIn 1933, with the rise to power of the Nazis, Ernst Freud left Berlin for London where he settled in St. John's Wood. He secured a number of commissions for private houses and blocks of flats around Hampstead including the notable Frognal Close in 1938, Belvedere Court, Lyttelton Road and a consulting room for Melanie Klein. Ernst Freud, his wife and children were naturalised British subjects at the end of August 1939.\nIn 1938, Ernst Freud's parents and younger sister Anna Freud joined the family in London and moved into a house in Hampstead that Ernst remodelled including the creation of a glazed garden room. The house today is the Freud Museum. After Sigmund Freud's death in 1939, Ernst Freud organised the funeral arrangements at the Golders Green Crematorium, with Harrods as funeral directors. Ernst Freud also later designed the marble plinth on which Sigmund Freud's urn was placed.\nFor the last three years of his life, following a heart attack that forced his retirement as an architect, Freud devoted his time to editing his father's correspondence, a project that had long been his spare-time occupation. He was the editor of \"Letters of Sigmund Freud\", published in New York in 1960, and he was co-editor of \"Psychoanalysis and Faith The Letters of Sigmund Freud and Oskar Pfister\", published in New York in 1964.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nFreud married Lucie Brasch, daughter of Joseph Brasch, a wealthy Berlin corn merchant. Lucie had studied classical philology in Berlin and Munich, as well as art history with Heinrich Wölfflin in Munich. To honour his wife, Ernst Freud added the middle initial L, for Lucie, to his name.\nErnst and Lucie had three sons: Stephen Gabriel Freud (1921–2015), an ironmonger; the painter Lucian Freud (1922–2011), who was named after his mother; and the politician and broadcaster Clement Freud (1924–2009).\nClement Freud wrote a memoir in which, according to journalist Harriet Lane, \"there are a few moments when indignation or irritation surge to the surface. In conversation, he is prepared to go further. In the book, for instance, he fudges his parents' non-appearance at his 1950 church wedding to actress Jill Raymond (who now runs two theatre companies in Suffolk). My interpretation had been that they had not been invited. But he corrects me on this. They were asked but chose, as atheists, not to attend.\"\nErnst Freud is buried in the \"Freud Corner\" at Golders Green Crematorium, London.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFreud family\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Additional sources ===\nWelter, Volker (2012).

She married Franklin Pierce, then a congressman, in 1834 despite her family's misgivings. She refused to live in Washington, D.C., and in 1842, she convinced her husband to retire from politics. He sought the Democratic presidential nomination without her knowledge in 1852 and was elected president later that year. Their only surviving son, Benjamin, was killed in a train accident before Franklin's inauguration, sending Jane into a deep depression that afflicted her for the rest of her life. Pierce was a reclusive first lady, spending the first two years of her husband's presidency mourning her son. Her duties at this time were often fulfilled by Abby Kent-Means. After Franklin's presidency, they traveled abroad for two years before settling in Massachusetts. She died of tuberculosis in 1863.\nPierce disliked political life and was unhappy in the role of first lady. She took interest in abolitionism, and attempted to influence her husband's decisions on the subject. A Puritan, Pierce was strictly religious and believed the tragedies she suffered were divine retribution for her and her husband's sins. Jane has been described as the opposite of her husband, who was outgoing, political, and a heavy drinker. She was reclusive, averse to politics, and teetotal.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJane Appleton was born in Hampton, New Hampshire, on March 12, 1806, to Congregationalist minister Jesse Appleton and his wife Elizabeth Means Appleton. The Appletons had six children: three elder daughters, of which Jane was the third, and three younger sons.

She is a patron of the Julia Margaret Cameron Trust, which runs the museum of the Victorian pioneer photographer.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nStark was born in New York. Her parents were Wilbur Stark, a writer and producer, and Kathi Norris, a writer and television presenter in New York City. She is the youngest of three children. At the time of her birth, the family lived in Manhattan. Her grandfather, Edwin Earl Norris, was a cabinetmaker and musician, playing horn and viola in the Newark Symphony Orchestra. Her mother's family were Presbyterians. After a divorce in the 1960s, her mother remarried.\nKoo Stark attended the Hewitt School in New York and the Glendower Preparatory School in Kensington, London. After training at a stage school, she began her acting career.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Acting ===\nHer first film role was in the comedy All I Want Is You... and You... and You... (1974), produced by her father. In 1975 she appeared in Las adolescentes (The Adolescents), opposite Anthony Andrews, and starred in an episode of Shades of Greene.\nAlso that year she had an uncredited role as a bridesmaid in The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Her best-remembered performance is the lead role in the erotic film Emily (1976), directed by Henry Herbert, 17th Earl of Pembroke. Uncertain whether to accept the part, Stark did so on the advice of Graham Greene, with whom she had worked the year before. Of working with her in Emily, actor Victor Spinetti later wrote \"I found Koo Stark to be an enchanting girl and terribly bright and interesting\".\nShe also appeared in Cruel Passion (1977), a film based on the novel Justine. Around the same time, she played the part of Camie Marstrap in Star Wars (1977); the scenes in which she appeared were cut from the film before its original release, but can be seen in Star Wars: Behind the Magic (1998).\nStark also began to work as a fashion model, particularly for Norman Parkinson. In February 1981, she was an understudy in the Edward Albee play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? at the National Theatre.\nShe appeared in the comedy Eat the Rich (1987), and then featured in \"Timeslides\", an episode of the sci-fi show Red Dwarf (1989), playing Lady Sabrina Mulholland-Jjones, the fiancée of a more successful Dave Lister. \nIn September 1987, she returned to the stage, taking the part of Vera Claythorne in Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None at the Duke of York's Theatre. The London Theatre Record posed the question \"Why has a girl so obviously three-dimensional chosen a part so obviously two-dimensional?\" She played Miss Scarlett in the 1991 series of Cluedo, succeeding Toyah Willcox and befriending Rula Lenska.\n\n\n=== Photography ===\nStark has worked as a photographer since the 1980s, and may have been the first person to turn the tables on the pursuing paparazzi by taking photos of them. Prince Andrew has told how in 1983 a photographic printer, Gene Nocon, invited Stark to take photographs of people taking photos of her, for his exhibition, Personal Points of View, planned for October. She persuaded Nocon to include Andrew's work as well. Her early photographs led to a book deal, for which she took lessons from Norman Parkinson. She travelled to Tobago, where he lived, and he became her mentor. Her book Contrasts (1985) included about a hundred of her photographs. She went on to study the work of leading photographers, including Angus McBean, whom she met and photographed, developing her interests in photography to include reportage, portraits, landscapes, still life, and other work.\nThe book Contrasts was launched at Hamiltons Gallery, London, in September 1985, at an exhibition of the same name. In 1994, the Gallery Bar at the Grosvenor House Hotel in Park Lane hosted an exhibition called 'The Stark Image', forty photographs by Stark, including \nThe Battle of Galveston was a naval and land battle of the American Civil War, when Confederate forces under Major Gen.

Union troops on shore thought the fleet was surrendering, and laid down their arms.\nThe battle is sometimes called the Second Battle of Galveston, as the Battle of Galveston Harbor (October 1862) is sometimes called the First Battle of Galveston.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nTwo Confederate cottonclads, CS Bayou City and the CS Neptune commanded by Leon Smith, sailed from Houston to Galveston in an effort to engage the Union Fleet in Galveston Harbor, which consisted of USS Clifton, USS Harriet Lane, USS Westfield, USS Owasco, USS Corypheus and USS Sachem.  Outnumbered six to two by the Northern ships, Neptune was severely damaged by the Union Fleet and eventually sank. While Neptune was quickly disabled, Bayou City succeeded in capturing USS Harriet Lane.\nDuring this time, USS Westfield was grounded on a sandbar.  A temporary truce between the two opposing sides was established, and despite still being outnumbered, the Confederate forces sent over an officer to negotiate terms of surrender of the Union fleet. Their proposal included the surrender of all Union ships present, save one which would be permitted to leave the Harbor with the crew of all other vessels. However, Union Fleet Commander William B. Renshaw rejected the Confederate offer, and attempted to destroy the grounded Westfield with explosives rather than let it fall into enemy hands.\nRenshaw and several Union troops were subsequently killed when the explosives were set off too early. Union troops on shore were convinced that their own ships were surrendering and, therefore, laid down their arms. The remaining U.S. ships did not surrender and succeeded in retreating to Union-controlled New Orleans.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Union blockade around the city of Galveston was lifted temporarily for four days, and Galveston remained the only major port that remained in Confederate hands at the end of the war. The Confederate Congress stated this on the successful recapture of Galveston:\n\nThe bold, intrepid, and gallant conduct of Maj. Gen. J. Bankhead Magruder, Col. Thomas Green, Maj. Leon Smith and other officers, and of the Texan Rangers and soldiers engaged in the attack on, and victory achieved over, the land and naval forces of the enemy at Galveston, on January 1, 1863, eminently entitle them to the thanks of Congress and the country... This brilliant achievement, resulting, under the providence of God, in the capture of the war steamer Harriet Lane and the defeat and ignominious flight of the hostile fleet from the harbor, the recapture of the city and the raising of the blockade of the port of Galveston, signally evinces that superior force may be overcome by skillful conception and daring courage.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJonathan Mayhew Wainwright II, killed in action during the battle.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNational Park Service battle description\nCWSAC Report Update\nThe Battle of Galveston (1 January 1863) at Lone Star Junction\nBattle of Galveston at The Handbook of Texas Online\nThe Medium Endurance Cutter or WMEC is a type of United States Coast Guard Cutter mainly consisting of the 270-foot (82 m) Famous- and 210-foot (64 m) Reliance-class cutters. These larger cutters are under control of Area Commands (Atlantic Area or Pacific Area). These cutters have adequate accommodations for crew to live on board and can do 6 to 8 week patrols.\nOther ships in the WMEC classification are the 282-foot (86 m) USCGC Alex Haley, and the now-decommissioned 213-foot (65 m) USCGC Acushnet, and 230-foot (70 m) USCGC Storis, and 205-foot (62 m) USCGC Tamaroa which began as the United States Navy Cherokee-class fleet tug USS Zuni launched in 1943.\nThere are 13 vessels in the Famous class, and 12 vessels still in active US service in the Reliance class. The Coast Guard plans to eventually phase out the vessels in both of these cutter classes and replace them with the Offshore Patrol Cutter as part of the Integrated Deepwater System Program.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter World War II, the United States Coast Guard used the US Navy hull classification system. The large, sea-going cutters were classified primarily as Coast Guard gunboats (WPG), destroyer escorts (WDE), and seaplane tenders (WAVP). In 1965 the Coast Guard adopted its own designation system and these large cutters were then referred to as Coast Guard High Endurance Cutters (WHEC). The coastal cutters once known as Cruising Cutters, Second Class and then as Coast Guard patrol craft (WPC) were now Coast Guard Medium Endurance Cutters (WMEC).\"\n\n\n== Famous-class cutter ==\n\nThe Famous-class vessels have hull numbers in the range from WMEC-901 through WMEC-913. Entering service in the 1980s, the Famous-class cutters were designed as replacements for the 327-foot (100 m) Treasury-class cutters, and their mission profile emphasized law enforcement, particularly patrolling the newly established 200-mile (320 km) exclusive economic zone.\nThe Coast Guard harvested weapons systems components from decommissioned Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates to save money. Harvesting components from four decommissioned frigates resulted in more than $24 million in cost savings, which increased with parts from more decommissioned frigates. Equipment such as the Mark 75, 76 mm/62 caliber gun mounts, gun control panels, barrels, launchers, junction boxes, and other components from decommissioned Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates were returned to service aboard Famous-class cutters in order to extend their service lives into the 2030s.\n\n\n== Service Life Extension Program ==\nThe service life extension (SLEP) program started in July 2021 with prototype work for electrical and structural systems on the Seneca and Harriet Lane. Additionally, Harriet Lane served as the gun weapons system prototype . The Spencer started the production phase of the SLEP on July 1, 2023, and the Legare on June 24, 2024.\nFour remaining cutters, Campbell, Forward, Escanaba and Tahoma will undergo SLEP.\n\n\n=== Ships in class ===\n\n\n== Reliance-class cutter ==\n\nThe Reliance-class vessels have hull numbers in the range from WMEC-615 through WMEC-630.  Entering service between 1964 and 1969, the Reliance-class cutters were meant to replace the 125-foot (38 m) cutters of the Prohibition era and were the first major cutter replacement project since the 255-foot (78 m) Owasco-class cutters from World War II. \nThe 210s (210-foot cutters) received upgrades and modifications (in a program named \"Midlife Maintenance Availability\" or MMA) during the 1986 through 1990 time period.  The \"A\"-class cutters had their gas turbines removed, and all 210s had their stern transom exhaust systems replaced with a traditional stack.  While this modification reduced the size of the flight deck, they were still more than capable of carrying out helicopter operations. Other modifications included enlarging the superstructure area, replacing the main armament, and increasing the fire-fighting capability of the cutters. The modifications cost approxima\nThe Battle of Galveston Harbor was fought at Galveston, Texas on October 4, 1862, during the American Civil War.  After attempts to blockade the Texas coastline were unsuccessful, the Union Navy decided to attempt to capture the port of Galveston.  While Galveston was defended by Confederate forces, most of the cannons in the city's defenses were removed, as Galveston was thought to be indefensible.  On October 4, five Union naval vessels commanded by Commander William B. Renshaw approached Galveston, and a single ship, USRC Harriet Lane was sent into Galveston Bay under a flag of truce.\nThe Confederates, commanded by Colonel Joseph J. Cook, could not get a boat to Harriet Lane in a timely manner, and the Union ship left the bay.  The Confederate boat headed for the Union fleet, which moved towards the bay under flags of truce to meet it.  Misunderstandings led to artillery fire, although a four-day truce was eventually made.  The terms of the truce were unclear, and the Confederates used the truce to evacuate the city, which was initially objected to by Renshaw.  At the expiration of the truce, Union troops landed in Galveston and raised the United States flag over the city.  The Confederates recaptured Galveston on January 1, 1863, in the Battle of Galveston.  The battlefield has lost historical integrity due to development and changes in the shoreline.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nWhen the American Civil War began in April 1861, President of the United States Abraham Lincoln declared a naval blockade of the coastline and ports of the Confederate States of America, with the goal of cutting the Confederates off from foreign trade.  At the time, the most significant port on the Texas portion of the Confederate coastline was Galveston.  After the blockade order was issued, Union Navy ships were sent to the Texas coast, but the blockade was not immediately effective.  Under international law of the time, a blockade needed to be effective in order to be legal, and in December, HMS Desperate visited Galveston and saw no US Navy presence.  William McKean, commander of the Gulf Blockading Squadron, doubted the accuracy of the British report but forwarded the information to the United States Secretary of the Navy.  Because of the shape of Galveston Bay, blockading the port would require at least two ships.\nUnder the supervision of Major General John B. Magruder, Confederate forces under W. W. Hunter had been placing artillery batteries, digging trenches, and obstructed harbor channels to ready the defense of Galveston.  The defenses were not particularly imposing, though, and Confederate officer Xavier Debray wrote in a letter than the city was not defensible.  The Union blockade still struggled with ineffectiveness, and the decision was made to capture some Confederate ports in order provide more bases for Union ships and fewer for blockade runners.  On May 17, 1862, the captain of the USS Santee sailed to Galveston, and demanded the surrender of the town, threatening to begin bombarding the place on May 23; the threatened attack did not occur.  In August, Union Admiral David Glasgow Farragut ordered Commander William B. Renshaw to destroy blockade runners and capture Galveston if practicable.\nGalveston Island itself was defended by a single artillery regiment, under the command of Colonel Joseph J. Cook.  The island was connected to the mainland by a bridge, which had a terminus on the mainland at a place known as Virginia Point.  Union intelligence believed that Virginia Point was strongly defended, but it was not.  Confederate defenses at Fort Point, which commanded the northern entrance to Galveston Bay, were also weak.  Confederate naval forces near Galveston were negligible.  Additional Confederate troops were in the Houston area and along the rail line between Houston and Galveston, bringing the total number of Confederate troops in the region to about 5,000.  Many of the cannons in the city's defenses had been removed, as Confederate\nEdward Lea (January 31, 1837 – January 1, 1863), was an officer in the United States Navy during the American Civil War. He was mortally wounded at the Battle of Galveston and died in the arms of his father, who was on the opposing side in the conflict.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLea was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Army engineer Albert Miller Lea and Ellen Shoemaker. He entered the Naval Academy at Annapolis on October 2, 1851, graduating on June 9, 1855, with the rank of midshipman. Lea was employed in active service on various stations, receiving promotion to passed midshipman on April 15, 1858, to master on November 4, 1858, and to lieutenant on November 22, 1860.\nLea was serving aboard the Hartford, flagship of the East India Squadron, when the Civil War broke out in 1861. The ship was recalled, eventually arriving in Delaware Bay in December. Lea was soon reassigned to the Harriet Lane, then attached to the Potomac Flotilla, but was soon reassigned in her to the Gulf Blockading Squadron, where he took part in operations leading to the capture of New Orleans in April 1862. Lea was subsequently promoted to lieutenant commander on July 16, 1862. Harriet Lane pushed further up the Mississippi that July to engage enemy batteries around Vicksburg, and was then assigned to the blockade of Galveston, which she helped capture in October 1862 in the Battle of Galveston Harbor.\nWhen Confederate forces retook Galveston on 1 January 1863, Lea, serving as the first officer (XO) of Harriet Lane, was wounded in the abdomen and side. He subsequently succumbed to his wounds in the arms of his father, who was serving as a major of artillery in the Confederate Army, and who had witnessed the capture of the Harriet Lane by the gunboat CS Bayou City from shore, and had rushed to the ship to find his son dying.\nLea and his captain, Jonathan M. Wainwright were buried together at the Trinity Episcopal Cemetery in Galveston. After the war Wainwright was re-interred at the Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis, but when a relative suggested that Lea's remains be reburied next to his mother in the Green Mount Cemetery, Baltimore, Albert Lea refused, stating that his son would have preferred to remain where he had fallen in battle.\n\n\n== Namesake ==\n\nThe destroyer USS Lea (DD-118) was named for him, as is Camp #2 of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War in Houston.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n This article incorporates text from the public domain Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships.\n\n\n== External links ==\nEdward Lea at Find a Grave\nEdwards A. Park (December 30, 1877 – July 11, 1969) was an American pediatrician who established the pediatric heart disease clinic at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, along with other pediatric subspecialties. During his career, Park was Chief of Pediatrics at the Harriet Lane Home for two decades, and published articles on medical conditions such as rickets and lead poisoning. The contemporary pediatric department at Hopkins is still regulated in the same way that Park established. The Edwards A. Park Scholarship Fund at Johns Hopkins was built under his name upon his eightieth birthday by friends, colleagues and former students.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nPark was born in Gloversville, New York, on December 30, 1877. His father was a local Congregational minister. Park attended Yale University and earned his B.A. degree in 1900. After his graduation, Park declined to follow his father into a religious occupation. He instead debated choosing between a career in medicine and a career in teaching Greek. He eventually decided to pursue medicine shortly after graduating from Yale University. \nPark first received his M.D.degree from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1905 and then went on to become an intern at the Roosevelt Hospital in New York from 1905 to 1907. He spent the next two years as an intern at the New York Foundling Hospital, working for six months in pediatrics where Dr. John Howland was an attending physician. Park also spent several months at the City Hospital on Blackwell Island, where he cultivated pathological skills and insight crucial to his later research in rickets.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nAfter completing varying internships, Park began his career at a private practice from 1909-1912 where he worked for Theodore Caldwell Janeway as an office assistant. It was with Dr. Janeway that Park published his first paper in 1910 focused on the contractions of arteries, which they had studied in vitro. In 1912, Park wrote his first pediatrics paper while studying pathology at Roosevelt Island. During that summer, Park also went to Marburg, Germany, to study under Dr. Schmidt, the world's leading expert in rickets at the time. While abroad, Park was offered a position by Dr. Howland to join his first pediatric staff at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Although Park initially declined because he was working with Dr. Janeway at that time and felt obliged to stay in the position, he later joined the small staff in an effort of creating a new full-time department of Pediatrics at Johns Hopkins.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nWhen World War I broke out in 1914, the American Red Cross sent Park to Le Havre, France, to run an orphanage for Belgian children. With a limited staff of only three doctors, a nurse, and an executive secretary, Park established a clinic and a small hospital in the local neighborhood. During this time, Park witnessed first-hand the effects of poverty and malnutrition on disease. This experience affected his decision to hire Ruth Wendell Washburn in the summer of 1918 and build a department of social service.\n\n\n=== Johns Hopkins ===\nIn 1919, Park returned to Baltimore, Maryland in the United States. Following his research with Dr. Howland, Park went to Yale where he took on the role as the Professor of Pediatrics for seven years. In 1927, Dr. Howland's death caused Park to return to Johns Hopkins to take over as the Professor of Pediatrics and Chief-of-Pediatrics. In 1946, Park was also named the Professor Emeritus of Pediatrics at the School of Medicine. As Chief-of-Pediatrics of the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Park established multiple specialty clinics under pediatrics, with tuberculosis, cardiac, endocrine, and psychiatric clinics bringing fame to the Harriet Lane Home. He was also known for his daily noon conferences with his staff where an intern, resident, and sub-specialist would all review a case. After they presented Park would question all parts, reviewing all steps and small details\nFirst Lady or First Gentleman is an unofficial title usually used for the spouse, and occasionally used for the offspring or other relative, of a non-monarchical head of state or chief executive. The term is also used to describe a person seen to be at the top of her profession or art.\nThe title has also been used for the spouse of a head of government who is not also head of state. It has also been used to refer to the spouses of the leaders of administrative divisions within a country. The title is often used for the wives of Christian pastors in denominations where married clergy are the norm.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIt has been noted that the earliest use of the term \"first lady\" is in reference to person of a high ranking or outstanding person in their field, and that the term, as used to describe the spouse of the president of the United States, saw its first documented use in 1838 in reference to Martha Washington, who was never referred to as such during George Washington's time as president.\nThe first person to have been referred to as \"first lady\" on a regular basis during their time in the position was Harriet Lane, who was actually James Buchanan's niece, as Buchanan was a lifelong bachelor.\n\n\n== Variations ==\n\nThe male equivalent of the title in countries where the head of state's spouse has been a man, such as the Philippines or Malta, is first gentleman. In 2020, Doug Emhoff, spouse of VP Kamala Harris, became the first male spouse of a U.S. vice president. \"First gentleman\" is used in the United States for the male spouse of a mayor or governor.\nFirst spouse and first partner, both rare variations of the title, can be used in either case where the spouse of a political leader is of any gender. This term is used to promote gender equality and gender neutrality.\nIn the United States, collectively, the president of the United States and his spouse are known as the first couple and, if they have children, they are usually referred to as the first family.\n\n\n== Use in non-English speaking countries ==\n\nFrench-speaking countries have used the term première dame for first ladies, regardless of where the first lady is from. At least one article, published in 2017, used the term premier monsieur for first gentleman. For that particular article, it was used to discuss the possibility of Louis Aliot becoming first gentleman, should his domestic partner, Marine Le Pen, win that year's presidential election. Emmanuel Macron defeated Le Pen in that year's election.\nPortuguese-speaking countries have used the term primeira-dama or \"Primeira Dama\" for first ladies. The term is used regardless of where the person is from. The term primeiro-cavalheiro is used for first gentlemen.\nIn Spanish-speaking countries, the term primera dama is used for first ladies, regardless of the country the person is from. The term primer caballero has been used for first gentlemen.\nSinophone countries have used the term 第一夫人 (dìyī fūrén) as a term for first ladies, also without regards as to where the first lady is from.\n\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n\n==== Czech Republic ====\nThe term první dáma is used for wife of the president of the Czech Republic.\n\n\n==== Poland ====\nThe term pierwsza dama (literal meaning: \"first lady\") is used by the wife of the current president of Poland.  \n\n\n==== Russia ====\nForeign press reports have referred to the wife of the Russian president as first lady. Russian first ladies have been less visible than their western counterparts due to historical reasons.\n\n\n===== Soviet Union =====\nIt has been noted that Soviet leaders generally preferred to keep their wives and families out of the spotlight, resulting in \"invisible first ladies\". As a result, low-profile first ladies remain common in post-Soviet countries, due to the leaders of those countries having grown up during the Soviet era.\nThe wife of Mikhail Gorbachev, Raisa Gorbachev, has been referred to as a Soviet first lady.\n\n\n==== Ukraine ====\nThe wife of the country's president has bee",

Her parents, Benjamin \"Benish\" and Henriette \"Yetta\" Levy, raised her, along with her sisters Addie and Polly, in the city at 920 O'Farrell Street which would become the topic of her memoir.\nYoung women such as Levy were expected to marry well-off men, which generated additional societal expectations. However, the intellectually inclined Levy was hesitant to marry early. Although her parents encouraged her to pursue an education, they also wanted her to follow 19th-century gender conventions. Levy's family was religiously observant and likely attended Sherith Israel Temple in San Francisco, but Levy later left the Jewish faith, along with her friend Sarah Stein, in favor of Christian Science."

Toklas, two friends who also had lived on O'Farrell Street. There they met up with more of Sarah's family, including Gertrude Stein, who Toklas fell in love with.\nIn 1908, in Paris, Levy was invited to Pablo Picasso's party in the Montmartre in and Montparnasse quarters, to honor the painter Henri Rousseau. Levy wrote a description of the famed Rousseau Banquet, which was published in a limited edition of 30 copies in 1985 as part of a UC Berkeley seminar."

After a few years of building, the building opened in October 1912. Harriet Lane Home for Invalid Children was the first children's clinic in the United States that was associated with a medical school.\nAt the time, most children were seen in the same facilities as adults, and pediatrics was just a subspecialty of general medicine. The new care model that Johns Hopkins pioneered became the industry standard for pediatrics in the United States. Eventually treating over 60,000 children a year, the Harriet Lane Home became a pioneer treatment, teaching, and research clinic, and the first to have subspecialties in pediatrics as created by Edwards A. Park."

One of the earliest uses of the term \"First Lady\" was applied to her in an 1838 newspaper article that appeared in the St. Johnsbury Caledonian, the author, \"Mrs. Sigourney\", discusses how Martha Washington had not changed, even after her husband George became president. She wrote that \"The first lady of the nation still preserved the habits of early life. Indulging in no indolence, she left the pillow at dawn, and after breakfast, retired to her chamber for an hour for the study of the scriptures and devotion.\""

Sometime after 1849, the title began being used in Washington, D.C., social circles. The first person to have the title applied to her while she was actually holding the office was Harriet Lane, the niece of James Buchanan; Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper used the phrase to describe her in an 1860 article about her duties as White House hostess. Another of the earliest known written examples comes from a November 3, 1863, diary entry of William Howard Russell, in which he referred to gossip about \"the First Lady in the Land\", referring to Mary Todd Lincoln.

The majority of his commissions were for houses and consulting rooms and he worked in an Art Deco style but by 1930 had begun to work in a modern style showing the influence of Mies van der Rohe. Examples of this include a cigarette factory in Berlin and a house for Dr. Frank in Geltow near Potsdam. Dr. Frank was a manager of Deutsche Bank until he was forced to give up his position in 1933 and into exile in 1938.\nIn 1933, with the rise to power of the Nazis, Ernst Freud left Berlin for London where he settled in St. John's Wood. He secured a number of commissions for private houses and blocks of flats around Hampstead including the notable Frognal Close in 1938, Belvedere Court, Lyttelton Road and a consulting room for Melanie Klein. Ernst Freud, his wife and children were naturalised British subjects at the end of August 1939."

Ernst Freud also later designed the marble plinth on which Sigmund Freud's urn was placed.\nFor the last three years of his life, following a heart attack that forced his retirement as an architect, Freud devoted his time to editing his father's correspondence, a project that had long been his spare-time occupation. He was the editor of \"Letters of Sigmund Freud\", published in New York in 1960, and he was co-editor of \"Psychoanalysis and Faith The Letters of Sigmund Freud and Oskar Pfister\", published in New York in 1964."

After the blockade order was issued, Union Navy ships were sent to the Texas coast, but the blockade was not immediately effective.
