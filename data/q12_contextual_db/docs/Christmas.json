{"page_content": "Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A feast central to the liturgical year in Christianity, it follows the season of Advent (which begins four Sundays before) or the Nativity Fast, and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries, is celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians, as well as culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of the holiday season surrounding it.\nThe traditional Christmas narrative recounted in the New Testament, known as the Nativity of Jesus, says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies. When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room, and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds, who then spread the word.\nThere are different hypotheses regarding the date of Jesus's birth, and in the early fourth century, the church fixed the date as December 25. It is exactly nine months after Annunciation on March 25, also the date of the spring equinox. Most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar, which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the world. However, part of the Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian calendar, which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian calendar. For Christians, believing that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the sins of humanity rather than knowing Jesus's exact birth date is considered to be the primary purpose of celebrating Christmas.\nThe customs associated with Christmas in various countries have a mix of pre-Christian, Christian, and secular themes and origins. Popular holiday traditions include gift giving; completing an Advent calendar or Advent wreath; Christmas music and caroling; watching Christmas movies; viewing a Nativity play; an exchange of Christmas cards; attending church services; a special meal; and displaying various Christmas decorations, including Christmas trees, Christmas lights, nativity scenes, garlands, wreaths, mistletoe, and holly. Additionally, several related and often interchangeable figures, known as Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, and Christkind, are associated with bringing gifts to children during the Christmas season and have their own body of traditions and lore. Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the Christmas festival involve heightened economic activity, the holiday has become a significant event and a key sales period for retailers and businesses. Over the past few centuries, Christmas has had a steadily growing economic effect in many regions of the world.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe English word Christmas is a shortened form of 'Christ's Mass'. The word is recorded as Cr\u012bstesm\u00e6sse in 1038 and Cristes-messe in 1131. Cr\u012bst (genitive Cr\u012bstes) is from the Greek \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 (Khr\u012bstos, 'Christ'), a translation of the Hebrew \u05de\u05b8\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05d7\u05b7\u200e (M\u0101\u0161\u00eea\u1e25, 'Messiah'), meaning 'anointed'; and m\u00e6sse is from the Latin missa, the celebration of the Eucharist.\nThe form Christenmas was also used during some periods, but is now considered archaic and dialectal. The term derives from Middle English Cristenmasse, meaning 'Christian mass'. Xmas is an abbreviation of Christmas found particularly in print, based on the initial letter chi (\u03a7) in the Greek \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, although some style guides discourage its use. This abbreviation has precedent in Middle English \u03a7\u03c1\u0304es masse (where \u03a7\u03c1\u0304 is another abbreviation of the Greek word).\n\n\n=== Other names ===\nThe holiday has had various other English names throughout its history. The Anglo-Saxons referred to the feast as \"midwinter\", or, more rarely, as\nChristmas to Christmas is the first Christmas album released on October 17, 1995, by American country music artist Toby Keith. His first studio album of Christmas music, it produced one single which charted from Christmas airplay in late 1995-early 1996: the track \"Santa I'm Right Here\", which peaked at #50 on the Hot Country Songs charts.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nRoch Parisien of AllMusic reviewed the album favorably, stating that \"The playing is casual, back-porch rootsy.

It tells the story of Jack Skellington, the King of \"Halloween Town\", who stumbles upon \"Christmas Town\" and schemes to take over the holiday. Danny Elfman wrote the songs and score and provided the singing voice of Jack. The principal voice cast includes Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, William Hickey, Ken Page, Paul Reubens, Glenn Shadix and Ed Ivory.\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas originated from a poem written by Burton in 1982 while he was working as an animator at Walt Disney Productions. With the critical success of Vincent that same year, Burton began to consider developing the film as either a short film or a half-hour television special, to no avail. Over the years, Burton's thoughts regularly returned to the project, and, in 1990, he made a development deal with Walt Disney Studios. Production started in July 1991 in San Francisco; Disney initially released the film through the Touchstone Pictures label because the studio believed the film would be \"too dark and scary for kids\".\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 9, 1993, and was given a limited release on October 13, before its wide theatrical release on October 29. The film was met with commercial and critical success upon release, earning praise for its animation, particularly the innovation of stop-motion as an art form, as well as its characters, songs, and score. While initially a modest box office hit, it has since garnered a large cult following and is widely regarded as one of the greatest animated films of all time. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, a first for an animated film, but lost to Jurassic Park. Thirteen years after its initial release, the film was reissued by Walt Disney Pictures and was re-released annually in Disney Digital 3-D from 2006 until 2010.\nIn 2023, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.\"\n\n\n== Plot ==\nHalloween Town is a fantasy world populated by various monsters and supernatural beings. Jack Skellington, the well-respected \"Pumpkin King\", leads the town in organizing the annual Halloween celebrations. This year, however, Jack grows tired of the same routine and longs for something new. Upon discovering trees containing doors to other holiday-themed worlds, Jack stumbles through the one leading to Christmas Town and is fascinated by the unfamiliar holiday.\nJack returns home and shares his discovery with his friends and neighbors, but they struggle to grasp the concept of Christmas, although there is one character in Christmas Town they can relate to, a mighty lobster-like king, who's known as \"Sandy Claws\". After several futile attempts at finding a way to rationally explain Christmas, Jack decides to \"improve\" the holiday instead. He announces that Halloween Town will take over Christmas this year and assigns Christmas-themed jobs, such as singing carols, making presents and building a sleigh pulled by skeletal reindeer, to various residents. \nSally, the creation of local mad scientist Doctor Finkelstein, experiences a vision predicting that their efforts will end disastrously. Jack, whom she secretly loves, dismisses her warnings and instructs her to make a Santa Claus suit for him. He also tasks mischievous trick-or-treating trio Lock, Shock and Barrel with abducting Santa; however, he orders them not to involve their superior, Oogie Boogie, a bogeyman with a passion for gambling, in their plot.\nWhen Lock, Shock and Barrel bring Santa to Halloween Town, Jack, surprised that he is not the clawed man he expected, tells Santa that he will take care of Christmas this ye\nChristmas Eve is the evening or entire day before Christmas Day, the festival commemorating the birth of Jesus. Christmas Day is observed around the world, and Christmas Eve is widely observed as a full or partial holiday in anticipation of Christmas Day. Together, both days are considered one of the most culturally significant celebrations in Christendom and Western society.\nChristmas celebrations in the denominations of Western Christianity have long begun on Christmas Eve, due in part to the Christian liturgical day starting at sunset, a practice inherited from Jewish tradition and based on the story of Creation in the Book of Genesis: \"And there was evening, and there was morning\u2014the first day.\" Many churches still ring their church bells and hold prayers in the evening; for example, the Nordic Lutheran churches. Since tradition holds that Jesus was born at night (based in Luke 2:6-8), Midnight Mass is celebrated on Christmas Eve, traditionally at midnight, in commemoration of his birth. The idea of Jesus being born at night is reflected in the fact that Christmas Eve is referred to as Heilige Nacht (Holy Night) in German, Nochebuena (the Good Night) in Spanish and similarly in other expressions of Christmas spirituality, such as the song \"Silent Night, Holy Night\".\nMany other varying cultural traditions and experiences are also associated with Christmas Eve around the world, including the gathering of family and friends, the singing of Christmas carols, the illumination and enjoyment of Christmas lights, trees, and other decorations, the wrapping, exchange and opening of gifts, and general preparation for Christmas Day. Legendary Christmas gift-bearing figures including Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Christkind, and Saint Nicholas are also often said to depart for their annual journey to deliver presents to children around the world on Christmas Eve, although until the Protestant introduction of Christkind in 16th-century Europe, such figures were said to instead deliver presents on the eve of Saint Nicholas' feast day (6 December).\n\n\n== Religious traditions ==\n\n\n=== Western churches ===\n\nWestern churches have traditionally observed Christmas Eve (properly the Vigil of the Nativity) as a liturgical observance distinct from the masses of Christmas Day, with the proper Gospel at the Mass for the Vigil of the Nativity being that of the Annunciation to Joseph in Matthew 1. The Vigil of the Nativity is not so much the first day of Christmas as it is the last day of Advent, and so it traditionally retains the liturgical color of violet. In traditional western liturgical practice, when the Fourth Sunday of Advent and Christmas Eve occur on the same day, the Sunday mass is of Christmas Eve and the Fourth Sunday of Advent is only commemorated.\nThe festivities of Christmas Day have, however, extended farther and farther back into Christmas Eve. While Roman Catholics, Lutherans, and some Anglicans traditionally celebrate Midnight Mass, the first mass of Christmas, either at or near midnight on Christmas Eve, some churches have in recent decades scheduled their \"Midnight\" Mass as early as 7 pm in an effort to better accommodate young children, whose choral singing has become a popular feature in some traditions.\nMidnight Mass is held in churches throughout the world and celebrates the birth of Christ, which is believed to have occurred at night. Midnight Mass is popular in Poland (pasterka) and Lithuania (piemen\u0117li\u0173 mi\u0161ios). In Latin America and the Iberian Peninsula, the Midnight Mass is also referred to as \"Rooster's Mass\" (Misa de Gallo in Spanish, Missa do Galo in Portuguese and Missa del Gall in Catalan). In the Philippines, the custom has expanded into the nine-day Simbang Gabi, when Filipinos attend dawn Masses (traditionally beginning around 04:00 to 05:00 PST) from 16 December, continuing daily until Christmas Eve. In 2009 Vatican officials scheduled the Midnight Mass to start at 10 pm so that the 82-year-old Pope Benedict X\nThe Territory of Christmas Island is an Australian external territory in the Indian Ocean comprising the island of the same name. It is located approximately 350 kilometres (190 nautical miles) south of Java and Sumatra and about 1,550 km (840 nmi) north-west of the closest point on the Australian mainland. It has an area of 135 square kilometres (52 sq mi). The territory derives its name from its discovery on Christmas Day 1643 by Captain William Mynors.\nChristmas Island had a population of 1,692 residents as of 2021, with the majority living in settlements on the northern edge of the island. The main settlement is Flying Fish Cove. Historically, Asian Australians of Chinese, Malay, and Indian descent formed the majority of the population. Today, around two-thirds of the island's population is estimated to have Straits Chinese origin (though just 22.2% of the population declared a Chinese ancestry in 2021), with significant numbers of Malays and European Australians and smaller numbers of Straits Indians and Eurasians. Several languages are in use including English, Malay, and various Chinese dialects. Religious beliefs vary geographically; the Anglo-Celtic influence in the capital known simply as The Settlement means it is closely tied to Catholicism, whereas in the Poon Saan area Buddhism is common, and Sunni Islam is generally observed in the shoreline water village where the Malays live. The religion question in the Australian census is optional, and 28% of the population do not declare their religious belief.\nThe first European to sight Christmas Island was Richard Rowe of the Thomas in 1615. Captain William Mynors named it on Christmas Day, 25 December 1643. It was first settled in the late 19th century. Christmas Island's geographic isolation and history of minimal human disturbance has led to a high level of endemism among its flora and fauna, which is of interest to scientists and naturalists. The majority (63%) of the island is included in the Christmas Island National Park, which features several areas of primary monsoonal forest. Phosphate, deposited originally as guano, has been mined on the island since 1899.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== First visits by Europeans, 1643 ===\nThe first European to sight the island was Richard Rowe of the Thomas in 1615. Captain William Mynors of the East India Company vessel Royal Mary named the island when he sailed past it on Christmas Day in 1643. The island was included on English and Dutch navigation charts early in the 17th century, but it was not until 1666 that a map published by Dutch cartographer Pieter Goos included the island. Goos labelled the island \"Mony\" or \"Moni\", the meaning of which is unclear.\nEnglish navigator William Dampier, aboard the privateer Charles Swan's ship Cygnet, made the earliest recorded visit to the sea around the island in March 1688. In writing his account, he found the island uninhabited. Dampier was trying to reach Cocos from New Holland. His ship was blown off course in an easterly direction, arriving at Christmas Island 28 days later. Dampier landed on the west coast, at \"the Dales\". Two of his crewmen became the first Europeans to set foot on Christmas Island.\nCaptain Daniel Beeckman of the Eagle passed the island on 5 April 1714, chronicled in his 1718 book, A Voyage to and from the Island of Borneo, in the East-Indies.\n\n\n=== Exploration and annexation ===\nThe first attempt at exploring the island was made in 1857 by Captain Sidney Grenfell of the frigate HMS Amethyst. An expedition crew were sent ashore with instructions to reach the summit of the plateau, but they failed to find a route up the inland cliff and were forced to turn back. During the 1872\u20131876 Challenger expedition to Indonesia, naturalist John Murray carried out extensive surveys.\nIn 1886, Captain John Maclear of HMS Flying Fish, having discovered an anchorage in a bay that he named \"Flying Fish Cove\", landed a party and made a small collection of the flora and fauna. In the next\nMariah Carey (;:\u200a0:01\u200a born March 27, 1969) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and actress. Referred to as the \"Songbird Supreme\" by Guinness World Records, she is known for her five-octave vocal range, melismatic singing style and signature use of the whistle register. As an influential figure in music, she was ranked as the fifth greatest singer of all time by Rolling Stone in 2023.\nCarey rose to fame in 1990 with her self-titled debut album and became the only artist to have their first five singles reach number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. She achieved an international success with the best-selling albums Music Box (1993) and Daydream (1995), before adopting a new urban image with hip hop-inflected sounds, following the release of Butterfly (1997). With eleven consecutive years of US number-one singles, Billboard ranked Carey as the most successful artist of the decade. Following a career decline and the failure of her 2001 film Glitter, she returned to the top of the charts with The Emancipation of Mimi (2005), one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century.\nCarey's public and personal life, including her diva persona, high-profile relationships and public breakdown in 2001, has received widespread media coverage. She has also been dubbed the \"Queen of Christmas\" due to the enduring popularity of her holiday music, particularly Merry Christmas (1994), the best-selling holiday album, and its single \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\", which is the best selling holiday single by a female artist of all time. Outside of music, she has acted in major roles in the films Tennessee (2008), Precious (2009), The Butler (2013), A Christmas Melody (2015), and The Lego Batman Movie (2017). Appearing on multiple television series, Carey served as an American Idol judge and starred in the docu-series Mariah's World. She published a memoir, The Meaning of Mariah Carey, in 2020.\nCarey is one of the best-selling music artists, with over 220 million records sold worldwide. She was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress, and The Long Island Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame. Her accolades include 5 competitive Grammy Awards and a Grammy Global Impact Award, 10 American Music Awards, 19 World Music Awards and 20 Billboard Music Awards. Carey's high-charting singles include \"One Sweet Day\" and \"We Belong Together\" \u2013 Billboard's most successful songs of the 1990s and 2000s, respectively. She holds the record for the most Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles by a solo artist (19), a female songwriter (18), and a female producer (15), spending a record 93 weeks atop the chart. Carey is the highest-certified female artist in the United States and 10th overall, with 75 million certified album units.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCarey was born on March 27, 1969, in Huntington, New York. Her name is derived from the song \"They Call the Wind Maria\", originally from the 1951 Broadway musical Paint Your Wagon. She is the youngest of three children born to Patricia (n\u00e9e Hickey), a former opera singer and vocal coach of Irish descent, and Alfred Roy Carey, an aeronautical engineer of both African-American and Afro-Venezuelan lineage. The last name \"Carey\" was adopted by her Venezuelan grandfather, Francisco N\u00fa\u00f1ez, after he emigrated to New York. Patricia's family disowned her for marrying a black man. Racial tensions prevented the Carey family from integrating into their community. While they lived in Huntington, their neighbors poisoned the family dog and set fire to their car. After her parents' divorce, Carey had little contact with Alfred, and Patricia worked several jobs to support the family. Carey spent much of her time at home alone and began singing at age three, often imitating her mother's take on Verdi's opera Rigoletto in Italian. Her older sister Alison moved in with their father while Mariah and her elder brother Morgan lived with their mother.\nDuring her \nThe Christmas season or the festive season; also known as the holiday season or the holidays, is an annual period generally spanning from late November or December to early January. Incorporating Christmas Day and New Year's Day, the various celebrations during this time create a peak season for the retail sector (Christmas/holiday \"shopping season\") extending to the end of the period (\"January sales\"). Christmas window displays and Christmas tree lighting ceremonies are customary traditions in various locales.\nIn Western Christianity, the Christmas season is traditionally synonymous with Christmastide, which runs from December 25 (Christmas Day) to January 5 (Twelfth Night or Epiphany Eve), popularly known as the 12 Days of Christmas. As the economic impact involving the anticipatory lead-up to Christmas Day grew in America and Europe into the 19th and 20th centuries, the term \"Christmas season\" began to also encompass the liturgical Advent season, the period observed in Western Christianity from the fourth Sunday before Christmas Day until Christmas Eve. The term \"Advent calendar\" continues to be widely known in Western parlance as a term referring to a countdown to Christmas Day from the beginning of December (although in retail planning the countdown to Christmas usually begins at the end of the summer season, and the beginning of September).\nBeginning in the mid-20th century, as the Christian-associated Christmas holiday and liturgical season, in some circles, became increasingly commercialized and central to American economics and culture while religio-multicultural sensitivity rose, generic references to the season that omitted the word \"Christmas\" became more common in the corporate and public sphere of the United States, which has caused a semantics controversy that continues to the present. By the late 20th century, the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah and the new African American cultural holiday of Kwanzaa began to be considered in the U.S. as being part of the \"holiday season\", a term that as of 2013 had become equally or more prevalent than \"Christmas season\" in U.S. sources to refer to the end-of-the-year festive period. \"Holiday season\" has also spread in varying degrees to Canada; however, in the United Kingdom and Ireland, the phrase \"holiday season\" has been the subject of some controversy.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Winter solstice ===\n\nThe winter solstice (in the northern hemisphere occurring in late December) may have been a special moment of the annual cycle for some cultures even during Neolithic times. This is attested by physical remains in the layouts of late Neolithic and Bronze Age archaeological sites, such as Stonehenge in England and Newgrange in Ireland. The primary axes of both of these monuments seem to have been carefully aligned on a sight-line pointing to the winter solstice sunrise (Newgrange) and the winter solstice sunset (Stonehenge). It is significant that the Great Trilithon was oriented outwards from the middle of the monument, i.e. its smooth flat face was turned towards the midwinter Sun.\n\n\n=== Roman Saturnalia ===\nSaturnalia was an ancient Roman festival in honor of the deity Saturn, the god of time, held on December 17 of the Julian calendar and later expanded with festivities through December 23. The holiday was celebrated with a sacrifice at the Temple of Saturn, in the Roman Forum, and a public banquet, followed by private gift-giving, continual partying, and a carnival atmosphere that overturned Roman social norms: gambling was permitted, and masters provided table service for their slaves. The poet Catullus called it \"the best of days.\"\n\n\n=== Feast of the Nativity: Christmas ===\n\nThe earliest source stating December 25 as the date of birth of Jesus was Hippolytus of Rome (170\u2013236), written very early in the 3rd century, based on the assumption that the conception of Jesus took place at the Spring equinox which he placed on March 25, to which he then added nine months.

Music associated with Christmas may be purely instrumental, or, in the case of carols, may employ lyrics about the nativity of Jesus Christ, traditions such as gift-giving and merrymaking, cultural figures such as Santa Claus, or other topics. Many songs simply have a winter or seasonal theme, or have been adopted into the canon for other reasons.\nWhile most Christmas songs before the 20th century were of a traditional religious character, the Great Depression brought a stream of U.S. songs that did not explicitly mention the Christian nature of the holiday, but rather the more secular traditional Western themes and customs associated with it. These included songs aimed at children such as \"Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town\" and \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\", as well as sentimental ballad-type songs performed by famous crooners of the era, such as \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\" and \"White Christmas\", the latter of which remained the best-selling single of all time as of 2024. Elvis' Christmas Album (1957) by Elvis Presley is the best-selling Christmas album of all time, having sold more than 20 million copies worldwide.\n\nPerformances of Christmas music at public concerts, in churches, at shopping malls, on city streets, and in private gatherings are a staple of the Christmas season in many cultures across the world. Many radio stations convert to a 24-7 Christmas music format leading up to the holiday; though the standard for most stations in the US is on or near Veterans Day, some stations adopt the format as early as the day after Halloween (or, exceptionally rarely, even sooner) as part of a phenomenon known as \"Christmas creep\". Liturgically, Christmas music traditionally ceases to be performed at the arrival of Candlemas, the traditional end of the Christmas-Epiphanytide season.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early music ===\n\nMusic associated with Christmas is thought to have its origins in 4th-century Rome, in Latin-language hymns such as Veni redemptor gentium. By the 13th century, under the influence of Francis of Assisi, the tradition of popular Christmas songs in regional native languages developed. Christmas carols in the English language first appear in a 1426 work of John Awdlay, an English chaplain, who lists twenty five \"caroles of Cristemas\", probably sung by groups of wassailers who would travel from house to house. In the 16th century, various Christmas carols still sung to this day, including \"The 12 Days of Christmas\", \"God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen\", and \"O Christmas Tree\", first emerged.\nMusic was an early feature of the Christmas season and its celebrations. The earliest examples are hymnographic works (chants and litanies) intended for liturgical use in observance of both the Feast of the Nativity and Theophany, many of which are still in use by the Eastern Orthodox Church. The 13th century saw the rise of the carol written in the vernacular, under the influence of Francis of Assisi.\nIn the Middle Ages, the English combined circle dances with singing and called them carols. Later, the word carol came to mean a song in which a religious topic is treated in a style that is familiar or festive. From Italy, it passed to France and Germany, and later to England. Christmas carols in English first appear in a 1426 work of John Audelay, a Shropshire priest and poet, who lists 25 \"caroles of Cristemas\", probably sung by groups of wassailers, who went from house to house. Music in itself soon became one of the greatest tributes to Christmas, and Christmas music includes some of the noblest compositions of the great musicians. Martin Luther, the father of Lutheran Christianity, encouraged congregational singing during the Mass, in addition to spreading the practice of caroling outside the liturgy.\n\n\n=== Puritan prohibition ===\nDuring the Commonwealth of England government under Cromwell, the Rump Parlia\nThis article lists characters seen in the 1993 film The Nightmare Before Christmas and the video games The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Pumpkin King and The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe filmmakers constructed 230 puppets to represent the characters in the film, with Jack Skellington having \"around eight hundred heads\", allowing the expression of every possible emotion. Sally's mouth movements \"were animated through the replacement method. During the animation process, only 's face 'mask' was removed to preserve the order of her long red hair. Sally had ten types of faces, each made with a series of eleven expressions and synchronised mouth movements.\"\n\n\n== Main ==\n\n\n=== Jack Skellington ===\n\nThe film's protagonist, Jack Skellington is a skeleton who holds the title of The Pumpkin King. He is popular among the residents of Halloween Town for his charming personality and aim to please, as he is well-meaning despite a lack of inhibition. He is in charge of Halloween, but repeating the same routine for years has caused him to feel his inspiration for his own holiday waning. However, after stumbling into Christmas Town, he gains new ideas and inspiration. He also appears in The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge.\nHe is voiced in all canon appearances by Chris Sarandon, and his singing voice in the film was provided by Danny Elfman. Since the film was originally released for adults, as it was thought to be \"too dark and scary for kids\", in non-English speaking countries, Disney Character Voices International only dubbed the film in a few languages in which adult and kids films are usually dubbed, while in other countries it was released with subtitles. Some versions dubbed only the spoken lines, leaving the songs in English.\nJack Skellington made a cameo in the film James and the Giant Peach as the \"pirate captain\". He also appears in the Robot Chicken episode \"Anne Marie's Pride\", where he is voiced by Victor Yerrid.\n\n\n=== Sally ===\n\nSally is Jack Skellington's love interest, a kind, shy, and determined rag doll who tells him that Christmas and Halloween should not mix and is the only one to have doubts about his Christmas plan. Fiona Apple provides the vocals for \"Sally's Song\" on the 2006 special edition of The Nightmare Before Christmas: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, while Amy Lee provides the vocals for \"Sally's Song\" on Nightmare Revisited. She also appears in Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge.\nShe has detachable limbs stuffed with fall leaves and often falls apart, requiring her to sew herself back together, which she carries a set of sewing needles and thread for. She was stolen by Doctor Finkelstein, Halloween Town's resident mad scientist, at a young age to be his companion. Their relationship is rather tense, as Finkelstein insists on keeping her imprisoned under the pretext of protecting her from the outside world and not wanting her to discover her original parents who reside in Dream Town in another realm. However, Sally is restless and curious, and despite his attempts to keep her imprisoned, she often manages to escape by sedating him with deadly nightshade.\nIt is this restlessness and a desire for something better in her life that draws her to Jack Skellington. In the beginning of the film, she idolizes and admires him like many residents of Halloween Town. However, she discovers they are connected by the desire for something more in their lives, and her feelings for him intensify. The two refer to each other as \"friends\", though Jack seems unaware of Sally's true feelings for him. This is because she is too shy to admit them to him, but shows them through her kindness until the end of the film, where she finally confesses to him.\nOn the album to the film, it is mentioned that years later, Sandy Claws returned to Halloween Town and saw Jack had four or five skeleton children. While not confirmed in the original film, the official sequel \nA Christmas Story Christmas is a 2022 American Christmas comedy film directed by Clay Kaytis from a script by Nick Schenk, who is also one of the executive producers. Produced by Peter Billingsley and Vince Vaughn along with Legendary's Cale Boyter and Jay Ashenfelter, Marc Toberoff and Irwin Zwilling, it is a sequel to the 1983 film A Christmas Story.

Principal photography began in late February 2022 in Hungary and Bulgaria.\nA Christmas Story Christmas was released in the United States on November 17, 2022, on HBO Max. The film has received a generally positive response from critics.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn December 1973, 33 years after A Christmas Story, 42-year-old Ralph \"Ralphie\" Parker lives in Chicago with his wife, Sandy, and two children, Mark and Julie. Ralph has been taking the year off from his job to write his first novel, but its excessive length leads multiple publishers to reject it. Mrs. Parker calls to tell Ralph that his father, \"the Old Man\", has died, and the grief-stricken family makes its way to Hohman, Indiana to be with her. She gives Ralph two tasks: write his father's obituary, and take up his mantle of making Christmas special for the family.\nRalph's children befriend one of the Bumpus kids next door, and have their snowman smashed by two bullies on a snowmobile. Ralph reunites with Flick, who now owns his father's old tavern, and Schwartz, who still lives with his mother and has run up a large tab at Flick's. While leaving the house to go ice skating, Sandy slips and sprains her ankle.\nAs Christmas Eve approaches, the family goes to Higbee's, where Ralph miraculously buys everything Mark and Julie asked for while the children speak to the store's Santa. On the way back, Ralph's car overheats, and Ralph accidentally hits Julie in the eye during an impromptu snowball fight. After Julie receives a temporary eyepatch at the hospital, the family discovers their car was robbed in the hospital parking lot; the presents are gone, and there is little money left to replace them.\nBack at Flick's, Flick offers to forgive Schwartz's tab if he sleds off a giant ramp; Schwartz manages to complete the stunt, but Mark breaks his arm sledding down the nearby hill afterwards. After Ralph is rejected by his final prospective publisher, he laments his difficulties, but is encouraged by his mother and Sandy. Remembering his favorite Christmas with his father inspires Ralph to write a long article instead of a standard obituary; however, he leaves it on the desk, needing to prepare for Christmas Day. Mark and Julie manage to get back at their bullies by building a snowman over a tree stump so that the snowmobile crashes.\nOn Christmas Eve night, the star falls off the Parker's tree and breaks, upsetting Julie. Frustrated, Ralph ignores objections from his wife and his mother and goes out to find a new star. All the local businesses are already closed, so Ralph breaks into Flick's tavern to \"borrow\" the star from the tree. On his way out, he is apprehended by Scut Farkus, now a Hohman police officer. Ralph is terrified of what Scut might do to him, but Scut brings him home, saying he owes Ralph because their childhood fight set him on a better path in life.\nMrs. Parker goes into the basement to change a fuse and finds several thoughtfully-picked, pre-wrapped gifts, which the Old Man had bought shortly before his death. On Christmas morning, the family is delighted to open them, and all their other presents as well. Ralph is confused by compliments he receives about his piece in the newspaper, and Sandy reveals she found the obituary manuscript and took it to the local paper becaus\nThe Christmas Chronicles 2 (titled onscreen as The Christmas Chronicles Part Two) is a 2020 American Christmas comedy film directed and produced by Chris Columbus, who wrote the screenplay with Matt Lieberman.

Wanting to be back home where it is snowing, Kate tries to secretly fly back early to Boston. Unbeknownst to her and their stowaway Jack, the shuttle is driven by Belsnickel, a nefarious Christmas elf, who sends them unepectedly through a wormhole to the North Pole.\nKate and Jack are found and saved by Santa Claus, who brings them back to his and Mrs. Claus's house. The Clauses give them a grand tour of their village, then dinner. Jack and Kate go to bed as Belsnickel and his follower Speck attempt to destroy the village.\nMrs. Claus tells the kids the origin story of Santa in Turkey, how he saved the elves from extinction, and received the Star of Bethlehem, a magical artifact that stops time in and provides power to Santa's Village. The Clauses adopted Belsnickel, but as he grew up and they had less time for him, he became unruly, transforming him into a human as a curse, so he ran away.\nBelsnickel releases the yule cat Jola into the reindeer pen, injuring Dasher. He then releases a potion into the village that makes the elves go insane and steals the Star of Bethlehem from the top of the Christmas tree.\nSanta and the others confront Belsnickel. The two struggle over the star, and it is accidentally destroyed, causing the power to go out in the village. So Santa and Kate leave for Turkey to get the forest elves, led by Hakan, to build a new one.\nThe maddened elves start a snowball fight that allows Jack to escape. He leaves to get a root to cure them while Mrs. Claus stays behind to heal Dasher. Meanwhile, Kate and Santa successfully find the elves and Hakan who give them a casing for a new star and Santa captures the power of the Star of Bethlehem inside it.\nWhile flying back to the village, Belsnickel catches up to them on a sleigh pulled by jackalotes (a hybrid of a jackal and a coyote which he created). He steals the star to stop himself from aging until he can figure out how to replace Santa, and transports them back to 1990 Boston via a time-travel device he planted on Santa's sleigh.\nJack finds the root and brings it back to Mrs Claus. Kate attempts to buy AAA batteries for Belsnickel's time travel device at Boston airport so she and Santa can return to the future. However, she is detained by airport security as the bill has the modern redesign so seems counterfeit.\nKate is taken to a locked lost kids security room. When she laments about her wrongdoings in Cancun, another kid named Doug Pierce comforts her and helps her escape. After Kate joins Santa, she realizes Doug is her late father. With help from airport worker Grace, Santa gets everybody singing a Christmas song so the weather clears. With Christmas spirit high enough for the sleigh to fly, he puts in the batteries and they transport back and recover the star.\nMrs. Claus makes the root into a powder, which Jack manages to load into the snow cannons. He shoots it onto the elves, curing them. Santa and Kate race back to the village evading Belsnickel as he chases them.\nMrs. Claus throws an explosive gingerbread cookie between the sleighs before they can collide in a game of chicken.

The day of Christmas, and in some cases the day before and the day after, are recognized by many national governments and cultures worldwide, including in areas where Christianity is a minority religion. In some non-Christian areas, periods of former colonial rule introduced the celebration (e.g. Hong Kong); in others, Christian minorities or foreign cultural influences have led populations to observe the holiday.\nChristmas traditions for many nations include the installing and lighting of Christmas trees, the hanging of Advent wreaths, Christmas stockings, candy canes, setting out cookies and milk, and the creation of Nativity scenes depicting the birth of Jesus Christ. Christmas carols may be sung and stories told about such figures as the Baby Jesus, St Nicholas, Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Christkind or Grandfather Frost. The sending and exchange of Christmas card greetings, observance of fasting and special religious observances such as a midnight Mass or Vespers on Christmas Eve, the burning of a Yule log, and the giving and receiving of presents are also common practice. Along with Easter, Christmas is one of the most important periods on the Christian calendar, and is often closely connected to other holidays at this time of year, such as Advent, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, St Nicholas Day, St. Stephen's Day, New Year's, and the Feast of the Epiphany.\n\n\n== Status of observance ==\n\nMany national governments recognize Christmas as an official public holiday, while others recognize it in a symbolic way but not as an official legal observance. Countries such as Japan, where Christmas is not a public holiday but is popular despite there being only a small number of Christians, have adopted many of the secular aspects of Christmas, such as gift-giving, decorations, and Christmas trees.\nChristmas is observed and is a public holiday (163 states and 2 territories)\n\nChristmas is observed but not a public holiday (21 states)\n\nChristmas is neither observed nor is a public holiday (13 states and 1 disputed territory)\n\nChristmas celebrations around the world can vary markedly in form, reflecting differing cultural and national traditions. Among countries with a strong Christian tradition, a variety of Christmas celebrations have developed that incorporate regional and local cultures.\n\n\n== Africa ==\n\n\n=== Ethiopia and Eritrea ===\n\nChristmas Day, known as Ledet in Eritrea and Gena in Ethiopia, is celebrated on January 7 (27 Tahsas of the Ethiopian calendar). Many Christians in Eritrea and Ethiopia observe a 40-day fast before the holiday, culminating in dawn church services on Christmas morning. The day features vibrant musical celebrations with priests in ceremonial robes performing rituals, including dancing and drumming. A traditional hockey-like game called gena is played in the afternoon, with the community leader awarding a prize to the winner. Most Ethiopians don a traditional shamma, a thin, white cotton wrap with brightly colored stripes across the ends. The celebration is followed by the three-day festival of Timkat, starting on January 19, which commemorates the baptism of Jesus Christ.\n\n\n=== Nigeria ===\nChristmas Day is a public holiday in Nigeria which is always marked by the emptying of towns and cities of Nigerians who have been successful returning to their ancestral villages to be with family and to bless those less fortunate. As the towns and cities empty, people jam the West African markets to buy and transport live chickens, goats and cows that will be needed for the Christmas meals.\nOn Christmas Eve, traditional meals are prepared according to the traditions of each region. Nigerians as a whole tend to prepare various meats in large quantities. In the south, a dish called jollof rice is served with stews of various meats along with boiled beans and fried plantains; in the north, rice and stew as well as tuwon shinkafa, a rice pudding se\nA Christmas Carol. In Prose. Being a Ghost Story of Christmas, commonly known as A Christmas Carol, is a novella by Charles Dickens, first published in London by Chapman & Hall in 1843 and illustrated by John Leech. It recounts the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, an elderly miser who is visited by the ghost of his former business partner Jacob Marley and the spirits of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come. In the process, Scrooge is transformed into a kinder, gentler man.\nDickens wrote A Christmas Carol during a period when the British were exploring and re-evaluating past Christmas traditions, including carols, and newer customs such as cards and Christmas trees. He was influenced by the experiences of his own youth and by the Christmas stories of other authors, including Washington Irving and Douglas Jerrold. Dickens had written three Christmas stories prior to the novella, and was inspired following a visit to the Field Lane Ragged School, one of several establishments for London's street children. The treatment of the poor and the ability of a selfish man to redeem himself by transforming into a more sympathetic character  are the key themes of the story. There is discussion among academics as to whether this is a fully secular story, or if it is a Christian allegory.\nPublished on 19 December, the first edition sold out by Christmas Eve; by the end of 1844 thirteen editions had been released. Most critics reviewed the novella favourably. The story was illicitly copied in January 1844; Dickens took legal action against the publishers, who went bankrupt, further reducing Dickens's small profits from the publication. He subsequently wrote four other Christmas stories. In 1849 he began public readings of the story, which proved so successful he undertook 127 further performances until 1870, the year of his death. A Christmas Carol has never been out of print and has been translated into several languages; the story has been adapted many times for film, stage, opera and other media.\nA Christmas Carol captured the zeitgeist of the early Victorian revival of the Christmas holiday. Dickens acknowledged the influence of the modern Western observance of Christmas and later inspired several aspects of Christmas, including family gatherings, seasonal food and drink, dancing, games and a festive generosity of spirit.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThe book is divided into five chapters, which Dickens titled \"staves\".\n\n\n=== Stave one ===\nA Christmas Carol opens on a bleak, cold Christmas Eve in London, seven years after the death of Ebenezer Scrooge's business partner, Jacob Marley. Scrooge, an ageing miser, dislikes Christmas and refuses a dinner invitation from his nephew Fred. He turns away two men seeking a donation to provide food and heating for the poor and only grudgingly allows his overworked, underpaid clerk, Bob Cratchit, Christmas Day off with pay to conform to the social custom.\nThat night Scrooge is visited at home by Marley's ghost, who wanders the Earth entwined by heavy chains and money boxes forged during a lifetime of greed and selfishness. Marley tells Scrooge that he has a single chance to avoid the same fate: he will be visited by three spirits and must listen or be cursed to carry much heavier chains of his own.\n\n\n=== Stave two ===\nThe first spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Past, takes Scrooge to Christmas scenes of Scrooge's boyhood, reminding him of a time when he was more innocent. The scenes reveal Scrooge's lonely childhood at boarding school, his relationship with his beloved sister Fan, the long-dead mother of Fred, and a Christmas party hosted by his first employer, Mr Fezziwig, who treated him like a son. Scrooge's neglected fianc\u00e9e Belle is shown ending their relationship, as she realises that he will never love her as much as he loves money. Finally, they visit a now-married Belle with her large, happy family on the Christmas Eve that Marley died. Scrooge, upset by hearing a description of the man that he has become, demand\nChristmas Bloody Christmas is a 2022 American Christmas-themed horror film directed and written by Joe Begos.

The film was released on December 9, 2022 and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film starts with vignettes that resemble the typical Christmas advertisements, along with a news flash regarding a robotic Santa that's been recalled because of a certain malfunction that reverts it from its original programming from the US Defense Department.\nRecord store owner Tori closes up her store for Christmas Eve night with her employee Robbie. Robbie, who is attracted to Tori, convinces her out of meeting with a date from Tinder and going out drinking with him. The pair meet with their friends Jay and Lahna who work at a nearby Toy store that is equipped with one of the defective Santa Clauses. The group drinks and hangs out before Tori and Robbie leave to go to a bar. The robot Santa malfunctions and becomes a violent killing machine, murdering Jay and Lahna while they have sex.\nCharmed by Robbie, Tori invites him back to her house, unaware they are being stalked by the robot Santa. They arrive at Tori's house and continue to flirt before finally having sex. Meanwhile, the robot Santa breaks into Tori's neighbors' house and slaughters the entire family; with Tori witnessing the child's murder. As she panics and warns Robbie, she notices the robot Santa has spotted her. Tori wakes up her sister Liddy and Liddy's husband Mike and attempts to escape the house with them and Robbie. The robot Santa attacks the group, killing Liddy and Mike while Tori and Robbie escape into Robbie's car. As they attempt to drive away, they find themselves blocked by another one of Tori's neighbors who is quickly killed by robot Santa. Unable to escape, Robbie is dragged out and killed by the robot Santa.\nA responding police officer arrives and manages to gun down the robot Santa for a moment before the robot Santa recovers and kills the officer. Tori runs over the robot Santa with the officer's car and drives away where she stumbles across more officers and an ambulance responding to the scene. Tori flags them down to help and tells them of the officer's death and is arrested by Sheriff Munroe. Back at the police station, Tori struggles to convince Munroe about the robot Santa. The robot Santa returns, having commandeered the ambulance, and attacks the station, killing Munroe and his partner. Tori retrieves a shotgun and fends off the robot Santa. She drives away in the ambulance, where the robot Santa climbs onboard and Tori crashes. Tori uses the crash to set the robot Santa alight, severely damaging it.\nRetreating to her record store, Tori is hunted by the robot Santa who is now nearly fully stripped to its robotic endoskeleton.

Written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff, the song was released as the lead single from the album on October 29, 1994, by Columbia Records. The track is an uptempo love song that includes bell chimes, backing vocals, and synthesizers. It has received critical acclaim, with The New Yorker describing it as \"one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon\". The song has become a Christmas standard, with a significant rise in popularity every December.\nThe song was a success when first released, reaching number six on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary chart in the United States and number two in the United Kingdom and Japan. The advent of music streaming has led to renewed success for the single, which now annually re-enters charts worldwide in the weeks before Christmas and has reached number one in over 30 countries, partially due to it being added to popular seasonal playlists. The single has broken the record for the longest gap between release and reaching number one in both the United States and the United Kingdom, 25 and 26 years respectively. The song has sold 16 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling digital singles of all time. As of 2023, the Associated Press estimated the song's royalty earnings at $100 million. That same year, the song was selected by the Library of Congress for inclusion in the National Recording Registry.\n\n\n== Background and writing ==\nFollowing the success of her 1993 album Music Box, Carey and her management at Columbia Records\u2014including Carey's then-husband, Tommy Mottola, head of Columbia's parent label Sony Music Entertainment\u2014began planning further projects. The group discussed recording a Christmas album, but hesitated, as such albums were typically released when artists' careers are waning. Carey's songwriting partner of over four years, Walter Afanasieff, said: \"Back then, you didn't have a lot of artists with Christmas albums. It wasn't a known science at all back then, and there was nobody who did new, big Christmas songs. So we were going to release it as kind of an everyday, 'Hey, you know, we're putting out a Christmas album. No big deal.'\"\nAfter Mottola persisted, Carey and Afanasieff began writing and composing songs for Merry Christmas in mid-1994. Carey decorated the home she shared with Mottola with Christmas decorations, feeling she could enter the holiday spirit and make her performance more authentic. \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" was recorded that August, and took Carey and Afanasieff a total of 15 minutes to write and compose.\n\nInitially, Afanasieff admitted that he was puzzled and \"blanched\" as to where Carey wanted to take the melody and vocal scales, though she was \"adamant\" in her direction for the song. In an interview with Billboard, Afanasieff described the type of relationship he and Carey shared in the studio and as songwriters:\n\nIt was always the same sort of system with us. We would write the nucleus of the song, the melody primary music, and then some of the words were there as we finished writing it. I started playing some rock 'n' roll piano and started boogie woogie-ing my left hand, and that inspired Mariah to come up with the melodic [Sings.] 'I don't want a lot for Christmas.' And then we started singing and playing around with this rock 'n' roll boogie song, which immediately came out to be the nucleus of what would end up being 'All I Want For Christmas Is You.' That one went very quickly: It was an easier song to write than some of the other ones. It was very formulaic, not a lot of chord changes. I tried to make it a little more unique, putting in some special chords that you really don't hear a lot of, which made it unique and special.\nThen for the next week or two Mariah would call me and say, 'What do you think about this bit?' We would ta\n\"Last Christmas\" is a song by English pop duo Wham!. Written and produced by George Michael, it was released on 3 December 1984 via CBS Records internationally and as a double A-side via Epic Records with \"Everything She Wants\" in several European countries. The song has been covered by many artists since its original release, including Whigfield, Crazy Frog, Billie Piper, Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande.\nUpon its initial release in 1984, \"Last Christmas\" spent five consecutive weeks at number two in the UK singles chart\u2014it was held off the top spot at Christmas by Band Aid's \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" (on which Michael also performed). After many chart runs in subsequent years, which included three more weeks at number two, and which saw the recording become part of RCA Records' catalogue, the song finally reached number one in the UK Singles Chart on New Year's Day 2021 (chart week ending date 7 January 2021), more than 36 years after its initial release; in doing so, it became the fifth UK number one single for the duo. Prior to it reaching number one, \"Last Christmas\" had for many years held the record as the highest-selling single never to top the charts by the Official Charts Company (OCC) with 1.9 million copies sold (not including streams). This record is now held by \"Mr. Brightside\" by The Killers. The song reached number one in the UK after it was streamed 9.2 million times in the last week of 2020 and sold 1,555 downloads, resulting in a total of 40,149 combined sales. Having been the Christmas number two again in 2022, \"Last Christmas\" finally achieved the accolade of Christmas number one in 2023, 39 years after its initial release. Combining sales and streams, it also became the third biggest song of all time in the UK.\nOutside the United Kingdom, the song topped the charts in Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Slovenia and Sweden, and peaked within the top ten of the charts in several countries including Australia, Canada and the United States. Wham! donated all of their royalties to relief efforts for the Ethiopian famine. In a UK-wide poll in December 2012, it was voted eight on the ITV television special The Nation's Favourite Christmas Song and was voted most popular song of the 1980s in Channel 5's Christmas 2020 countdown Britain's Favourite 80's Songs. It was the most-played Christmas song of the 21st century in the UK until it was overtaken by \"Fairytale of New York\" in 2011.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\n\"Last Christmas\" had its beginnings in 1983, while George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley were visiting Michael's parents. It was written by Michael in his childhood bedroom. Michael played Ridgeley the introduction and chorus melody to \"Last Christmas\", which Ridgeley later called \"a moment of wonder\".\n\n\n=== Recording ===\nThe song was recorded in August 1984, at Advision Studios, London, England. George Michael wrote, performed, produced and played every single instrument on the track. With a LinnDrum drum machine, a Roland Juno-60 synth and sleigh bells, they began recording the song in the summer, Michael having \"plastered [the studio] in Christmas decorations to set the mood\". The only other people in the studio were engineer Chris Porter and two assistants, Paul Gommersal and Richard Moakes. According to Porter, lyrically \"you've got the happiness of the rhythm track, but against that you've got the sadness of the unrequited love\".\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n\nWham! already had two number one singles on the UK singles chart during 1984, and news that they were planning a Christmas single meant that a battle for the coveted Christmas number one spot in Britain seemed set to be between Wham! and the year's other big act, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, who had achieved a third No. 1 in early December with \"The Power of Love\". The Band Aid single written by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, produced the No. 1 single \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\", while Wham!'s offering peaked at No. 2 for much of the period. \nThis is a list of television films produced for the cable networks Hallmark Channel (HC) and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries (HMM).

A classic example of a cumulative song, the  lyrics detail a series of increasingly numerous gifts given to the speaker by their \"true love\" on each of the twelve days of Christmas (the twelve days that make up the Christmas season, starting with Christmas Day). The carol, whose words were first published in England in the late eighteenth century, has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 68.  A large number of different melodies have been associated with the song, of which the best known is derived from a 1909 arrangement of a traditional folk melody by English composer Frederic Austin.\n\n\n== Lyrics ==\n\n\"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" is a cumulative song, meaning that each verse is built on top of the previous verses. There are twelve verses, each describing a gift given by \"my true love\" on one of the twelve days of Christmas.\nThere are many variations in the lyrics. The lyrics given here are from Frederic Austin's 1909 publication that established the current form of the carol. The first three verses run, in full, as follows:\n\nSubsequent verses follow the same pattern. Each verse deals with the next day of Christmastide, adding one new gift and then repeating all the earlier gifts, so that each verse is one line longer than its predecessor.\n\nfour calling birds\nfive gold rings\nsix geese a-laying\nseven swans a-swimming\neight maids a-milking\nnine ladies dancing\nten lords a-leaping\neleven pipers piping\ntwelve drummers drumming\n\n\n=== Variations of the lyrics ===\n\nThe earliest known publications of the words to \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" were an illustrated children's book, Mirth Without Mischief, published in London in 1780, and a  broadsheet by Angus, of Newcastle, dated to the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries.\nWhile the words as published in Mirth Without Mischief and the Angus broadsheet were almost identical, subsequent versions (beginning with James Orchard Halliwell's Nursery Rhymes of England of 1842) have displayed considerable variation:\n\nIn early versions, at the beginning of each verse, the word on is skipped; for example, the last verse begins simply as \"The twelfth day of Christmas\".  On was added in Austin's 1909 version, and became very popular thereafter.\nIn the early versions \"my true love sent to me\" the gifts. However, a 20th-century variant has \"my true love gave to me\"; this wording has become particularly common in North America.\nIn one 19th-century variant, the gifts come from \"my mother\" rather than \"my true love\".\nSome variants have \"juniper tree\" or \"June apple tree\" rather than \"pear tree\", which is likely a mishearing of \"partridge in a pear tree\".\nThe 1780 version has \"four colly birds\"\u2014colly being a regional English expression for \"coal-black\" (the name of the collie dog breed may come from this word).  This wording must have been opaque to many even in the 19th century: \"canary birds\", \"colour'd birds\", \"curley birds\", and \"corley birds\" are found in its place.  Austin's 1909 version, which introduced the now-standard melody, also changed the fourth gift to four \"calling\" birds, and this variant has become the most popular, although \"colly\" is still occasionally found.\n\"Five gold rings\" has often become \"five golden rings\", especially in North America since the 1961 recording by Mitch Miller and The Gang. In the standard melody, this change enables singers to fit one syllable per musical note.\nThe gifts associated with the final four days are often reordered.  For example, the pipers may be on the ninth day rather than the eleventh.\nFor ease of comparison with Austin's 1909 version given above:\n\n\n==== Scotland ====\nA similar cumulative verse from Scotland, \"The Yule Days\", has been likened to \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" in the scholarly literature. It has thirteen days rather than twelve, and the number of gifts does not increase in the manner of \"The Twelve Days\".  Its final verse, as published in Chambers, Popular Rhymes,\nA Christmas carol is a carol (a song or hymn) on the theme of Christmas, traditionally sung at Christmas itself or during the surrounding Christmas holiday season. The term noel has sometimes been used, especially for carols of French origin. Christmas carols may be regarded as a subset of the broader category of Christmas music.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first known Christmas hymns may be traced to 4th-century Rome. Latin hymns such as Veni redemptor gentium, written by Ambrose, Archbishop of Milan, were austere statements of the theological doctrine of the Incarnation in opposition to Arianism. Corde natus ex Parentis (Of the Father's heart begotten) by the Spanish poet Prudentius (d. 413) is still sung in some churches today.\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries, the Christmas sequence (or prose) was introduced in Northern European monasteries, developing under Bernard of Clairvaux into a sequence of rhymed stanzas. In the 12th century the Parisian monk Adam of Saint Victor began to derive music from popular songs, introducing something closer to the traditional Christmas carol.\nIn the 13th century, in France, Germany, and particularly, Italy, under the influence of Francis of Assisi, a strong tradition of popular Christmas songs in regional native languages developed. Christmas carols in English first appear in a 1426 work of John Awdlay, a Shropshire chaplain, who lists twenty five \"caroles of Cristemas\", probably sung by groups of 'wassailers', who went from house to house. The songs now known specifically as carols were originally communal songs sung during celebrations like harvest tide as well as Christmas. It was only later that carols began to be sung in church, and to be specifically associated with Christmas.\nMany carols which have gained popularity were printed in Piae Cantiones, a collection of late medieval Latin songs which was first published in 1582. Early, Latin forms of carols such as \"Christ was born on Christmas Day\", \"Good Christian Men, Rejoice\" and \"Good King Wenceslas\" can be found in this book. \"Adeste Fideles\" (\"O Come all ye faithful\") appears in its current form in the mid-18th century, although the words may have originated in the 13th century. The origin of the tune is disputed.\nCarols gained in popularity after the Reformation in the countries where Protestant churches gained prominence (as well-known Reformers like Martin Luther authored carols and encouraged their use in worship). This was a consequence of the fact that the Lutheran reformation warmly welcomed music. During the years that the Puritan ban on Christmas was in place in England, semi-clandestine religious services marking Christ's birth continued to be held, and people sang carols in secret.\n\nThe publication of Christmas music books in the 19th century helped to widen the popular appeal of carols. \"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen\", \"The First Noel\", \"I Saw Three Ships\" and \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\" appear in English antiquarian William Sandys' 1833 collection Christmas Carols, Ancient and Modern. Composers such as Arthur Sullivan helped to repopularise the carol, and it is this period that gave rise to such favourites as \"Good King Wenceslas\" and \"It Came Upon the Midnight Clear\", a New England carol written by Edmund H. Sears and Richard S. Willis. The publication in 1871 of Christmas Carols, New and Old by Henry Ramsden Bramley and Sir John Stainer was a significant contribution to a revival of carols in Victorian Britain. In 1916, Charles Lewis Hutchins published Carols Old and Carols New, a scholarly collection which suffered from a short print run and is consequently rarely available today. The Oxford Book of Carols, first published in 1928 by Oxford University Press (OUP), was a notably successful collection; edited by the British composers Martin Shaw and Ralph Vaughan Williams, along with clergyman and author Percy Dearmer, it became a widely used source of carols in among choirs and church congregations in Britain and remains in ", "metadata": {"title": "Christmas", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas"}}
