{"page_content": "William Gregor (25 December 1761 \u2013 11 June 1817) was a British clergyman and mineralogist who discovered the elemental metal Titanium.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nHe was born at the Trewarthenick Estate in Cornwall, the son of Francis Gregor and Mary Copley and the brother of Francis Gregor, MP for Cornwall. He was educated at Bristol Grammar School, where he became interested in chemistry, then after two years with a private tutor entered St John's College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1784 and MA in 1787. He was ordained in the Church of England. He became vicar of St Mary's Church Diptford near Totnes, Devon. He married Charlotte Anne Gwatkin in 1790 and they had one daughter, Charlotte-Anne Gregor.\n\n\n== Discovery of titanium ==\nAfter a brief interval at Bratton Clovelly, in 1793 William and his family moved permanently to the rectory of Creed in Cornwall. Here he continued his remarkably accurate chemical analysis of minerals, most of which came from Cornwall, such as the zeolites found in gabbro on The Lizard. He also analysed wavellite, tourmaline, and the uranium minerals torbernite and autunite, the arsenate scorodite, the lead mineral mimetite and the nickel mineral niccolite, and others. But he is best known for one of his earliest discoveries: in 1791, while analysing the minerals in a black sand he had discovered in the Manaccan valley, he isolated the calx of an unknown metal which he named manaccanite. Later in 1791, Martin Heinrich Klaproth discovered what is now known as the transition metal, titanium in the mineral rutile. Believing this to be a new discovery, Klaproth named it titanium after the Titans of Greek Mythology, but eventually it was clarified that Gregor made the discovery first. Gregor was credited with the discovery, but the element kept the name chosen by Klaproth. Gregor later found titanium in corundum from Tibet, and in a tourmaline from a local tin mine.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nGregor was made an honorary member of the Geological Society of London on its inception in 1807, and was a founding member of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall in 1814. His friends and correspondents included John Hawkins, Philip Rashleigh and John Ayrton Paris. Never letting his scientific work interfere with his pastoral duties, he was also a distinguished landscape painter, etcher and musician. He died of tuberculosis on 11 June 1817 and was buried at nearby Cornelly church.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n Works by or about William Gregor at Wikisource\nTitanium is a chemical element; it has symbol Ti and atomic number 22. Found in nature only as an oxide, it can be reduced to produce a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density, and high strength, resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia, and chlorine.\nTitanium was discovered in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791 and was named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth after the Titans of Greek mythology. The element occurs within a number of minerals, principally rutile and ilmenite, which are widely distributed in the Earth's crust and lithosphere; it is found in almost all living things, as well as bodies of water, rocks, and soils. The metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores by the Kroll and Hunter processes. The most common compound, titanium dioxide, is a popular photocatalyst and is used in the manufacture of white pigments. Other compounds include titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), a component of smoke screens and catalysts; and titanium trichloride (TiCl3), which is used as a catalyst in the production of polypropylene.\nTitanium can be alloyed with iron, aluminium, vanadium, and molybdenum, among other elements. The resulting titanium alloys are strong, lightweight, and versatile, with applications including aerospace (jet engines, missiles, and spacecraft), military, industrial processes (chemicals and petrochemicals, desalination plants, pulp, and paper), automotive, agriculture (farming), sporting goods, jewelry, and consumer electronics. Titanium is also considered one of the most biocompatible metals, leading to a range of medical applications including prostheses, orthopedic implants, dental implants, and surgical instruments.\nThe two most useful properties of the metal are corrosion resistance and strength-to-density ratio, the highest of any metallic element. In its unalloyed condition, titanium is as strong as some steels, but less dense. There are two allotropic forms and five naturally occurring isotopes of this element, 46Ti through 50Ti, with 48Ti being the most abundant (73.8%).\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Physical properties ===\nAs a metal, titanium is recognized for its high strength-to-weight ratio. It is a strong metal with low density that is quite ductile (especially in an oxygen-free environment), lustrous, and metallic-white in color. Due to its relatively high melting point (1,668 \u00b0C or 3,034 \u00b0F) it has sometimes been described as a refractory metal, but this is not the case. It is paramagnetic and has fairly low electrical and thermal conductivity compared to other metals. Titanium is superconducting when cooled below its critical temperature of 0.49 K.\n\nCommercially pure (99.2% pure) grades of titanium have ultimate tensile strength of about 434 MPa (63,000 psi), equal to that of common, low-grade steel alloys, but are less dense. Titanium is 60% denser than aluminium, but more than twice as strong as the most commonly used 6061-T6 aluminium alloy. Certain titanium alloys (e.g., Beta C) achieve tensile strengths of over 1,400 MPa (200,000 psi). However, titanium loses strength when heated above 430 \u00b0C (806 \u00b0F).\nTitanium is not as hard as some grades of heat-treated steel; it is non-magnetic and a poor conductor of heat and electricity. Machining requires precautions, because the material can gall unless sharp tools and proper cooling methods are used. Like steel structures, those made from titanium have a fatigue limit that guarantees longevity in some applications.\nThe metal is a dimorphic allotrope of a hexagonal close packed \u03b1 form that changes into a body-centered cubic (lattice) \u03b2 form at 882 \u00b0C (1,620 \u00b0F). The specific heat of the \u03b1 form increases dramatically as it is heated to this transition temperature but then falls and remains fairly constant for the \u03b2 form regardless of temperature.\n\n\n=== Chemical properties ===\n\nLike aluminium and magnesium, the surface of titanium metal and its alloys oxidize immediately upon exposure to air to form a thin non\nGregor is a surname, and notable people with the surname include:\n\nA.

The clan's most famous member is Rob Roy MacGregor of the late 17th and early 18th centuries. The clan is also known to have been among the first families of Scotland to begin playing the bagpipes in the early 17th century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins of the clan ===\nClan Gregor held lands in Glen Orchy, Glenlochy and Glenstrae. According to Iain Moncreiffe the MacGregors were descended from an ancient Celtic royal family, through the Abbots of Glendochart. This is alluded to in the clan's motto: \"Royal is my race\". There is also a tradition that Gregor was the brother of Kenneth MacAlpin. Though there is little evidence to support this tradition, it is supported by the Scottish historian, William Skene. It is possible that the eponymous Gregor from whom the family derives may have been Griogair, son of Dungal, who was allegedly co-ruler of Alba.\nMost modern historians agree that the first chief of Clan Gregor was Gregor of the golden bridles. His son was Iain Camm One eye, who succeeded as the second chief sometime before 1390.\nThe barony of Loch Awe which included much of the MacGregor lands was granted to the chief of Clan Campbell by Robert the Bruce. The Campbells had already built Kilchurn Castle which controlled the gateway to the western Highlands and they harried the MacGregors who were forced to retire deeper into their lands until they were restricted to Glenstrae.\n\n\n=== 16th century and clan conflicts ===\n\nIain of Glenstrae died in 1519 with no direct heirs. He was the second of his house to be called the Black. The succession of Eian was supported by the Campbells, and he married a daughter of Sir Colin Campbell of Glenorchy. In 1547 Eian's son, Alistair, fought against the English at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh but died shortly after.\nColin Campbell refused to recognize the claim of Gregor Roy MacGregor to the estates, and for ten years Gregor waged a war against the Campbells. He was an outlaw who raided cattle and sheltered in the high glens. However, in 1570, he was captured and murdered by the Campbells. The chiefship was claimed by his son, Alistair, but he was unable to stem the Campbell's persecution of his kinsmen, who over time became known as the Children of the Mist, a name associated with the MacGregors due to the extent of their losses.\nAdditionally, John Drummond of Clan Drummond was the king's forester and was subsequently killed after hanging a number of MacGregors for poaching. The chief took responsibility for the killing and it was condemned by the Privy Council.\n\n\n=== 17th century, clan conflicts and civil war ===\n\nIn response to the execution of two MacGregor clansmen in 1603, Alasdair MacGregor marched into Colquhoun territory with a force of over 400 men.\nThe chief of Clan Colquhoun, in response, had been granted a royal commission to suppress the MacGregors. Colquhoun assembled a force of 500 foot and 300 cavalry and advanced to Glen Fruin to repel the Highland raiders. MacGregor split his force in two and while the main MacGregor force and the Colquhouns engaged in combat, the second MacGregor force attacked the Colquhouns from the rear. The Colquhouns were driven into the Moss of Auchingaich where their cavalry was useless, and over 200 Colquhouns were killed. At the end of the 18th century, in an act of good will, the chiefs of the two clans met and shook hands on the site of the former slaughter.\nIn April 1603, James VI of Scotland issued an edict that proclaimed the name of MacGregor as \"altogidder abolisheed\". This meant that anyone who bore the name must renounce it or suffer death. In 1604, MacGregor and eleven of his chieftains were hanged at Mercat Cross, Edinburgh. As a result, Clan Gregor was scattered, with many taking other names such as Murray or Grant. They were hunted like animals and flushed out of the heather by bloodhounds.\nAn Edinburgh burgess, Robe\nGregor Johann Mendel OSA (; Czech: \u0158eho\u0159 Jan Mendel; 20 July 1822 \u2013 6 January 1884) was an Austrian-Czech biologist, meteorologist, mathematician, Augustinian friar and abbot of St. Thomas' Abbey in Brno (Br\u00fcnn), Margraviate of Moravia. Mendel was born in a German-speaking family in the Silesian part of the Austrian Empire (today's Czech Republic) and gained posthumous recognition as the founder of the modern science of genetics. Though farmers had known for millennia that crossbreeding of animals and plants could favor certain desirable traits, Mendel's pea plant experiments conducted between 1856 and 1863 established many of the rules of heredity, now referred to as the laws of Mendelian inheritance.\nMendel worked with seven characteristics of pea plants: plant height, pod shape and color, seed shape and color, and flower position and color. Taking seed color as an example, Mendel showed that when a true-breeding yellow pea and a true-breeding green pea were cross-bred, their offspring always produced yellow seeds. However, in the next generation, the green peas reappeared at a ratio of 1 green to 3 yellow. To explain this phenomenon, Mendel coined the terms \"recessive\" and \"dominant\" in reference to certain traits. In the preceding example, the green trait, which seems to have vanished in the first filial generation, is recessive, and the yellow is dominant. He published his work in 1866, demonstrating the actions of invisible \"factors\"\u2014now called genes\u2014in predictably determining the traits of an organism.\nThe profound significance of Mendel's work was not recognized until the turn of the 20th century (more than three decades later) with the rediscovery of his laws. Erich von Tschermak, Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns independently verified several of Mendel's experimental findings in 1900, ushering in the modern age of genetics.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMendel was born into a German-speaking family in Heinzendorf bei Odrau, in Silesia, Austrian Empire (now Hyn\u010dice in the Czech Republic). He was the son of Anton and Rosine (Schwirtlich) Mendel and had one older sister, Veronika, and one younger, Theresia. They lived and worked on a farm which had been owned by the Mendel family for at least 130 years (the house where Mendel was born is now a museum devoted to Mendel). During his childhood, Mendel worked as a gardener and studied beekeeping. As a young man, he attended gymnasium in Troppau (Czech: Opava). Due to illness, he had to take four months off during his gymnasium studies. From 1840 to 1843, he studied practical and theoretical philosophy and physics at the Philosophical Institute of the University of Olomouc (German: Olm\u00fctz), taking another year off because of illness. He also struggled financially to pay for his studies, and Theresia gave him her dowry. Later he helped support her three sons, two of whom became doctors.\nHe became a monk partly because it enabled him to obtain an education without paying for it himself. As the son of a struggling farmer, the monastic life, in his words, spared him the \"perpetual anxiety about a means of livelihood.\" Born Johann Mendel, he was given the name \"Gregor\" (\u0158eho\u0159 in Czech) when he joined the Order of Saint Augustine.\n\n\n== Academic career ==\n\nWhen Mendel entered the Faculty of Philosophy, the Department of Natural History and Agriculture was headed by Johann Karl Nestler, who conducted extensive research on hereditary traits of plants and animals, especially sheep. Upon recommendation of his physics teacher Friedrich Franz, Mendel entered the Augustinian St Thomas's Abbey in Brno and began his training as a priest. Mendel worked as a substitute high school teacher. In 1850, he failed his exams' oral part, the last of three parts, to become a certified high school teacher. In 1851, he was sent to the University of Vienna to study under the sponsorship of Abbot Cyril Franti\u0161ek Napp so that he could get a more formal education. At Vienna, his professor of physics was Ch\nSir William MacGregor,  (20 October 1846 \u2013 3 July 1919) was a Lieutenant-Governor of British New Guinea, Governor of Lagos Colony, Governor of Newfoundland and Governor of Queensland.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMacGregor was born in Hillockhead, parish of Towie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, the eldest son of John MacGregor, a crofter, and his wife Agnes, daughter of William Smith of Pitprone. MacGregor was educated at the school at the Strathmore manse,  later a teacher at Tillyduke and worked as a farm labourer. Encouraged by his schoolmaster and the local doctor who recognised MacGregor's ability, he entered Aberdeen Grammar School in April 1866 and enrolled at the University of Aberdeen in October 1867. He graduated MB and CM of Aberdeen University in 1872, and obtained his MD in 1874. MacGregor also studied at Anderson's Medical College (LFPS) and the University of Edinburgh (LRCP). MacGregor then became a medical assistant at the Royal Lunatic Asylum, Aberdeen.\n\n\n== Medical career ==\nIn February 1873 MacGregor became assistant medical officer at the Seychelles, and in 1874 he was appointed resident at the hospital and superintendent of the lunatic asylum at Mauritius. This brought him under the notice of Sir Arthur Gordon who was then governor of the island, and on Gordon being transferred to Fiji in 1875, he obtained MacGregor's services as chief medical officer of Fiji. There he had to grapple with a terrible epidemic of measles, which resulted in the death of 50,000 natives. In 1877 he was made receiver-general and subsequently a variety of other offices was added, including the colonial secretaryship. On more than one occasion he acted as governor, and was also acting high commissioner and consul-general for the western Pacific.\nIn 1884 the ship Syria, with coolies for Fiji, ran ashore about 15 miles (24 km) from Suva. Doctor MacGregor organised a relief expedition and personally saved several lives; his report made no mention of his own deeds, but they could not remain hidden, and he was given the Albert Medal, and the Clarke gold medal of the Royal Humane Society of Australasia for saving life at sea. In January 1886 he represented Fiji at the meeting of the federal council of Australasia held at Hobart.\n\n\n== Administrator and governor ==\nMacGregor was described as 'sincere, discriminating, and courageous'.  A linguist, MacGregor spoke Italian, French, and German; in one instance when with the Austrian Archduke Ferdinand (1863\u20131914) in the Territory of Papua, he translated from a German officer to the Italian cook on instructions to cook a wallaby.\n\n\n=== British New Guinea (1888\u20131898) ===\nMacGregor's experience with native races led to his being appointed administrator of British New Guinea, from 4 September 1888 to 13 March 1895. Here he had to deal with a warlike people separated in many tribes, and his great problem was to get them to live together in reasonable amity. It was necessary at times to make punitive expeditions, but bloodshed was avoided as much as possible, and by tact and perseverance MacGregor eventually brought about a state of law and order. Some of this in part related to the annual headhunting raid and cannibalisation of coastal tribes by the Tugeri warriors, which he ended. He did a large amount of exploration not only along the coast but into the interior. Andrew Gibb Maitland was seconded as geologist in 1891. In 1892 the position was sufficiently settled to enable him to publish a Handbook of Information for intending Settlers in British New Guinea. He was awarded the 1896 Founder's Medal of the Royal Geographical Society for his services to geography.\nAdministrator MacGregor was appointed lieutenant-governor on 13 March 1895, and retired from this position on 10 September 1898.\n\n\n=== Lagos Colony (1899\u20131904) ===\nFrom 1899 to 1904 he was governor of Lagos Colony, Nigeria, where he instituted a campaign against the prevalent malaria, draining the swamps and destroying as far as possible the mosquitoes w\nTrewarthenick (Cornish: Trewedhenek) is a hamlet in the civil parish of Tregoney in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom.\nTrewarthenick lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).

Finnis described him as her \"great friend and mentor\". On 7 September 1976, she showed the clematis at a Royal Horticultural Society Show where it won an Award of Merit. \nClematis \u2018Bill MacKenzie' is a large, vigorous deciduous climber with finely-cut leaves. Its flowers are 6-7cm in width with four thick, spreading bright yellow sepals surrounding dark stamens from early to late summer. It has good silky seed-heads. Clematis \u2018Bill MacKenzie\u2019 has been awarded the RHS Award of Garden Merit.\n\n\n== References ==\nGeneral Gregor MacGregor (24 December 1786 \u2013 4 December 1845) was a Scottish soldier, adventurer, and confidence trickster who attempted from 1821 to 1837 to draw British and French investors and settlers to \"Poyais\", a fictional Central American territory that he claimed to rule as \"Cazique\". Hundreds invested their savings in supposed Poyaisian government bonds and land certificates, while about 250 emigrated to MacGregor's invented country in 1822\u201323 to find only an untouched jungle; more than half of them died. Seen as a contributory factor to the \"Panic of 1825\", MacGregor's Poyais scheme has been called one of the most brazen confidence tricks in history.\nFrom the Clan Gregor, MacGregor was an officer in the British Army from 1803 to 1810; he served in the Peninsular War. He joined the republican side in the Venezuelan War of Independence in 1812, quickly became a general and, over the next four years, operated against the Spanish on behalf of both Venezuela and its neighbour New Granada. His successes included a difficult month-long fighting retreat through northern Venezuela in 1816. He captured Amelia Island in 1817 under a mandate from revolutionary agents to conquer Florida from the Spanish, and there proclaimed a short-lived \"Republic of the Floridas\". He then oversaw two calamitous operations in New Granada during 1819 that each ended with his abandoning British volunteer troops under his command.\nOn his return to Britain in 1821, MacGregor claimed that King George Frederic Augustus of the Mosquito Coast in the Gulf of Honduras had created him Cazique of Poyais, which he described as a developed colony with a community of British settlers. When the British press reported on MacGregor's deception following the return of fewer than 50 survivors in late 1823, some of his victims leaped to his defence, insisting that the general had been let down by those whom he had put in charge of the emigration party. A French court tried MacGregor and three others for fraud in 1826 after he attempted a variation on the scheme there, but convicted only one of his associates. Acquitted, MacGregor attempted lesser Poyais schemes in London over the next decade. In 1838, he moved to Venezuela, where he was welcomed back as a hero. He died in Caracas in 1845, aged 58, and was buried with full military honours in Caracas Cathedral.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\n\n=== Family and childhood ===\n\nGregor MacGregor was born on Christmas Eve 1786 at his family's ancestral home of Glengyle, on the north shore of Loch Katrine in Stirlingshire, Scotland, the son of Daniel MacGregor, an East India Company sea captain, and his wife Ann (n\u00e9e Austin). The family was Roman Catholic and part of the Clan Gregor, whose proscription by King James VI and I in 1604 had been repealed only in 1774. During the proscription on their faith, the MacGregors had been legally ostracised to the extent that they were forbidden to use their own surname\u2014many of them, including Gregor's celebrated great-great-uncle Rob Roy, had participated in the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745. MacGregor would assert in adulthood that a direct ancestor of his had survived the Darien scheme of 1698, the ill-fated Scottish attempt to colonise the Isthmus of Panama. Gregor's grandfather, also called Gregor and nicknamed \"the Beautiful\", served with distinction in the British Army under the surname Drummond, and subsequently played an important role in the clan's restoration and rehabilitation into society.\nLittle is recorded of MacGregor's childhood. After his father's death in 1794, he and his two sisters were raised primarily by his mother with the help of various relatives. MacGregor's biographer David Sinclair speculates that he would probably have spoken mainly Gaelic during his early childhood, and learned English only after starting school around the age of five-and-a-half. MacGregor would claim in later life to have studied at the University of Edinburgh between 1802 and 1803; records of t\nWilliam Gregor George (13 October 1903 \u2013 prior to 22 March 1933) was a rugby union player who represented Australia.\nGeorge, a fly-half, was born in Sydney and claimed a total of 12 international rugby caps for Australia.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe Gregor George Shield and Cup were named in his honour.\n\n\n== References ==\nThe Metamorphosis (German: Die Verwandlung), also translated as The Transformation, is a novella by Franz Kafka published in 1915. One of Kafka's best-known works, The Metamorphosis tells the story of  salesman Gregor Samsa, who wakes one morning to find himself inexplicably transformed into a huge insect (German: ungeheueres Ungeziefer, lit. \"monstrous vermin\") and struggles to adjust to this condition. The novella has been widely discussed among literary critics, who have offered varied interpretations. In popular culture and adaptations of the novella, the insect is commonly depicted as a cockroach. \nAbout 70 printed pages, it is the longest of the stories Kafka considered complete and published during his lifetime. It was first published in 1915 in the October issue of the journal Die wei\u00dfen Bl\u00e4tter under the editorship of Ren\u00e9 Schickele. The first edition in book form appeared in December 1915 in the series Der j\u00fcngste Tag, edited by Kurt Wolff.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nGregor Samsa wakes up one morning to find himself transformed into a \"monstrous vermin\". He initially considers the transformation to be temporary and slowly ponders the consequences of his metamorphosis. Stuck on his back and unable to get up and leave the bed, Gregor reflects on his job as a traveling salesman and cloth merchant, which he characterizes as being full of \"temporary and constantly changing human relationships, which never come from the heart\". He sees his employer as a despot and would quickly quit his job if he were not his family's sole breadwinner and working off his bankrupt father's debts. While trying to move, Gregor finds that his office manager, the chief clerk, has shown up to check on him, indignant about Gregor's unexcused absence. Gregor attempts to communicate with both the manager and his family, but all they can hear from behind the door is incomprehensible vocalizations. Gregor laboriously drags himself across the floor and opens the door. The clerk, upon seeing the transformed Gregor, flees the apartment. Gregor's family is horrified, and his father drives him back towards his room. Gregor is injured when he tries to force himself through the doorway (which is too narrow for him), but gets unstuck when his father shoves him through.\nWith Gregor's unexpected transformation, his family is deprived of financial stability. They keep Gregor locked in his room, and he begins to accept his new identity and adapt to his new body. His sister Grete is the only one willing to bring him food, which she finds Gregor only likes if it is rotten. He spends much of his time crawling around on the floor, walls, and ceiling. Upon discovering Gregor's new pastime, Grete decides to remove his furniture to give him more space. She and her mother begin to empty the room of everything, except the sofa under which Gregor hides whenever anyone comes in. He finds their actions deeply distressing, fearing that he might forget his past as a human, and desperately tries to save a particularly loved portrait on the wall of a woman clad in fur. His mother loses consciousness at the sight of him clinging to the image to protect it. When Grete rushes out of the room to get some aromatic spirits, Gregor follows her and is slightly hurt when she drops a medicine bottle and it breaks. Their father returns home and angrily hurls apples at Gregor, one of which becomes lodged in a sensitive spot in his back and severely wounds him.\nGregor suffers from his injuries and eats very little. His father, mother, and sister all get jobs and increasingly begin to neglect him, and his room begins to be used for storage. For a time, his family leaves Gregor's door open in the evenings so he can listen to them talk to each other, but this happens less frequently once they rent a room in the apartment to three male tenants, since they are not told about Gregor. One day, the charwoman, who briefly looks in on Gregor each day when she arrives and before she leaves, neglects to close his do\nMartin Heinrich Klaproth (1 December 1743 \u2013 1 January 1817) was a German chemist. He trained and worked for much of his life as an apothecary, moving in later life to the university. His shop became the second-largest apothecary in Berlin, and the most productive artisanal chemical research center in Europe.\nKlaproth was a major systematizer of analytical chemistry, and an independent inventor of gravimetric analysis. His attention to detail and refusal to ignore discrepancies in results led to improvements in the use of apparatus.  He was a major figure in understanding the composition of minerals and characterizing the elements. \nKlaproth discovered uranium (1789) \nand zirconium (1789).  \nHe was also involved in the discovery or co-discovery of \ntitanium (1795), \nstrontium (1793), \ncerium (1803), and  \nchromium (1797) and confirmed the previous discoveries of \ntellurium (1798) and \nberyllium (1798).\nKlaproth was a member and director of  the  Berlin Academy  of  Sciences. He was recognized internationally as a member of the Royal Society in London, the Institut de France, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n\n\n== Career ==\nKlaproth was born in Wernigerode. He was the son of a tailor, and attended the Latin school at Wernigerode for four years.\nFor much of his life he followed the profession of  apothecary. In 1759, when he was 16 years old, he apprenticed at Quedlinburg. In 1764, he became a journeyman. He trained in pharmacies at Quedlinburg (1759\u20131766); Hanover (1766\u20131768, with August Hermann Brande); Berlin (1768); and Danzig (1770).\nIn 1771, Klaproth returned to Berlin to work for Valentin Rose the Elder as manager of his business. Following Rose's death, Klaproth passed the required examinations to become senior manager.  Following his marriage in 1780, he was able to buy his own establishment, the Apotheke zum Baren. Between 1782 and 1800, Klaproth published 84 papers based on researches carried out in the Apotheke's laboratory. His shop was the most productive site of artisanal chemistry investigations in Europe at that time.\nBeginning in 1782, he was the assessor of pharmacy for the examining board of the Ober-Collegium Medicum. In 1787 Klaproth was appointed lecturer in chemistry to the Prussian Royal Artillery.\nIn 1788, Klaproth became an unsalaried member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences. In 1800, he became the salaried director of the Berlin Academy of Sciences.  He sold the apothecary and moved to the academy, where he convinced the university to build a new laboratory. Upon completion in 1802, Klaproth moved the equipment from his apothecary laboratory into the new building.\nWhen the University of Berlin was founded in 1810 he was selected to be the professor of chemistry.\nHe died in Berlin on New Year's Day in 1817.\n\n\n== Contributions ==\n\nAn exact and conscientious worker, Klaproth did much to improve and systematise the processes of analytical chemistry and mineralogy. His appreciation of the value of quantitative methods led him to become one of the earliest adherents of the Lavoisierian doctrines outside France.\nKlaproth was the first to discover uranium, identifying it first in torbernite but doing the majority of his research on it with the mineral pitchblende. \nOn 24 September 1789 he announced his discovery to the Royal Prussian Academy of sciences in Berlin. He also discovered zirconium in 1789, separating it in the form of its \u201cearth\u201d zirconia, oxide ZrO2. Klaproth analyzed a brightly-colored form of the mineral called \"hyacinth\" from Ceylon. He gave the new element the name zirconium based on its Persian name \"zargun\", gold-colored.:\u200a515\u200a\nKlaproth characterised uranium and zirconium as distinct elements, though he was unable to isolate them.\nKlaproth independently discovered  cerium (1803), a rare earth element, around the same time as J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger, in the winter of 1803.\nWilliam Gregor of Cornwall was the first to identify the element titanium in 1791, correctly c\nGregor the Overlander is a children's epic fantasy novel. The book was written by Suzanne Collins and was published in 2003 as the first book of The Underland Chronicles. It was received well by critics, and was listed as one of New York Public Library's 100 Books for Reading and Sharing. It was featured by National Public Radio in 2005.\nThe novel has been published in several languages and is available as both an audiobook and ebook. Its United Kingdom edition was published under the alternative title Gregor and the Rats of the Underland.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nEleven-year-old Gregor is left home alone in his family's New York City apartment to watch his sisters and grandmother. When Gregor's baby sister Boots falls through an old air duct grate in the building's basement, he dives in after her. The two fall miles below into the Underland: a subterranean world home to humans with near-translucent skin, violet eyes, and silver hair; giant sentient bats, rodents, and insects; and an escalating conflict between the human kingdom of Regalia and the rats' King Gorger. They meet several \"Underlanders\", among them the human Regalians' crown princess Luxa, who is Gregor's age, her cousin Henry, aged 14, and the bats who are \"bonded\" to them as warrior allies. At first, Gregor wants only to return home, but when he is attacked by two rats during an escape attempt and saved by the Underlanders, he inadvertently brings the conflict between the two groups to a head.\nIt is then that he learns the real reason for the rats' hatred of Overlanders: a mysterious prophecy written by the human colony's founder Bartholomew of Sandwich hints that an Overland \"warrior\" will stop an attempt by the rats to take over the underground realm once and for all. The Regalian council believes Gregor to be this warrior, and tries to convince him to undertake the quest mentioned in the \"Prophecy of Gray\". Though he sympathizes, Gregor is reluctant to help until he learns a surprising fact: his father, who disappeared unexpectedly over two years before, had actually fallen down into Regalia just like Gregor and Boots and been taken prisoner by the rats. Gregor, his sister, and a group of Regalians go on a journey to rescue Gregor's father and recruit allies for a war against the rats.\nThe quest group is challenged to successfully recruit allies for the Regalians, along the way facing battles with giant spiders, scorpions, and rats. The group of children are left in the care of the rat Ripred, who is a rebel against King Gorger. The group journeys to find Gregor's dad emaciated and tortured in the personal prison of King Gorger. When the rat king discovers their rescue attempt, Henry reveals that he has been helping the rats all along, hoping to ally them with the Regalians and genocide the weaker species of the realm. During the questers' attempt to escape, Gregor sacrifices himself to lure the rats' attack force \u2014 King Gorger and Henry among them \u2014 off the edge of a cliff. Henry's bat Ares, who had no knowledge of his bond's treachery, chooses to save Gregor rather than Henry as they fall. King Gorger, Henry, and hundreds of rats perish in the fall. When the few remaining quest members make it back to Regalia, Luxa and her family are devastated, both because of Henry's treason and death, and because Ares has been sentenced to banishment for allowing his bond to die. Gregor saves his life by using his status as the \"warrior\" to form a new bond with him. When things have settled down somewhat and the Regalian doctors have done all they can for his father, Gregor, his sister and his father return to the surface and reunite with his family.\n\n\n=== The Prophecy of Gray ===\nBeware, Underlanders, time hangs by a thread\nThe hunters are hunted, white water runs red.\nThe gnawers will strike to extinguish the rest.\nThe hope of the hopeless resides in a quest.\nMeaning: The usually uneasy balance of power in the Underland is in flux, with the rats' king planning to launch an \nThe Murray, later MacGregor of MacGregor Baronetcy, of Lanrick in the County of Perth, is a title in the Baronetage of Great Britain. It was created on 3 July 1795 for John Murray. He was a member of the Scottish MacGregor clan. This branch of the family had been forbidden to bear their own surname by King James VI, the only instance of this in British history. The ban was revoked in 1661 by King Charles II but restored during the reign of William and Mary. It was finally repealed in 1774. However, it was not until 1822 that the family obtained Royal licence to use the family surname. The second Baronet was a colonial administrator and served as Governor of Dominica, Antigua, Barbados and Trinidad. Sir Evan MacGregor, third son of the second Baronet, was Permanent Secretary to the Admiralty. The sixth Baronet was a Brigadier in the Scots Guards. The MacGregors of MacGregor are also the Chiefs of Clan Gregor.\n\n\n== Murray, later MacGregor of MacGregor baronets, of Lanrick (1795) ==\nLieutenant-Colonel Sir John Murray, 1st Baronet (1745\u20131822), later Macgregor Murray.\nMajor-General Sir Evan John Murray-MacGregor, 2nd Baronet (1785\u20131841), married (28 May 1808), Lady Elizabeth Murray (d. 1846), daughter of John Murray, 4th Duke of Atholl).\nSir John Atholl Bannatyne Murray-MacGregor, 3rd Baronet (1810\u20131851), of Lanrick and Balquhidder.\nRear-Admiral Sir Malcolm Murray-MacGregor, 4th Baronet (1834\u20131879)\nCaptain Sir Malcolm MacGregor, 5th Baronet (1873\u20131958)\nBrigadier Sir Gregor MacGregor, 6th Baronet (1925\u20132003)\nSir Malcolm Gregor Charles MacGregor, 7th Baronet (b. 1959)\nThe heir presumptive is his only brother, Ninian Hubert Alexander MacGregor (b. 1961)\nThe heir presumptive's heir apparent is his only son, Archibald Callum Ludovic MacGregor (b. 2000)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nKidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).

His father, Antonio, was a machine operator, factory worker and a nonpolitical anarchist. Gregor served as a volunteer in the U.S. Army. He attended and graduated in 1952 from Columbia University and thereafter served as a high school social science teacher while working for his advanced degrees. \nPrior to founding the International Association for the Advancement of Ethnology and Eugenics, he published several articles on race science and syndicalism for Oswald Mosley's The European and Corrado Gini\u2019s Genus. Gregor's first article in the latter was a defense of Gini's theories, and the two subsequently became friends and collaborators until Gini's death in 1965.\n\n\n== Eugenics and philosophy ==\nIn 1959, Gregor joined with Robert E. Kuttner to found the International Association for the Advancement of Ethnology and Eugenics (IAAEE), where Gregor acted as secretary. According to Gregor, the organization was founded to restore \"an intellectual climate in the U.S., and throughout the Western World, which would permit a free and open discussion of racial ... problems.\" The organization was funded by segregationist Wickliffe Draper to oppose the civil rights movement. As part of this group, Gregor was also an assistant editor of, and contributor to, Mankind Quarterly, the organization's journal.\nDuring this period he undertook anthropological field studies of aboriginal people in Central Australia, and similar studies in South Africa and in the southern United States. In 1960, he obtained employment as a philosophy instructor at Washington College, and in 1961 he received his doctorate at Columbia as an Irwin Edman Scholar and with Distinction in History after his dissertation on Giovanni Gentile. Gregor became assistant professor of philosophy at the University of Hawaii from 1961 to 1964. He became an associate professor of philosophy at the universities of Kentucky and Texas between 1964 and 1967. Gregor joined the Political Science Department at the University of California at Berkeley in 1967 where he remained until his retirement.\n\n\n== Study of fascism ==\n\nGregor was part of a movement of scholars in the 1960s who rejected the traditional interpretation of fascism as an ideologically empty, reactionary, antimodern dead end. He claimed Italian fascism owed a major debt to European ideological currents in sociology and political theory. Gregor described fascism as a coherent and serious theory of state and society, and argued that it played a revolutionary and modernizing role in European history. His theory of generic fascism portrayed it as a form of \"developmental dictatorship.\" Since the 1970s, Gregor spent most of his academic research on the study of fascism and it is for this that he is best known. In 1969, he published The Ideology of Fascism: The Rationale of Totalitarianism; in 1974, he wrote The Fascist Persuasion in Radical Politics. Since then he published other works on the subject, such as Mussolini's Intellectuals, The Search for Neofascism, and Marxism, Fascism, and Totalitarianism.\nGregor argued that scholars do not agree on the definition of fascism, stating in 1997 that \"Almost every specialist has his own interpretation.\" He argued that Marxist movements of the 20th century discarded Marx and Engels and instead adopted theoretical categories and political methods much like those of Mussolini. In The Faces of Janus (2000) Gregor asserted that the original \"Fascists were almost all Marxists\u2014serious theorists who had long been identified with Italy's intelligentsia of the Left.\" In Young Mussolini (1979), Gregor describes Fascism as \"a variant of classical Marxism.\" According to Gregor, many revolu\nWilliam McGregor (13 April 1846 \u2013 20 December 1911) was a Scottish association football administrator in the Victorian era who was the founder of the Football League (now English Football League), the first organised association football league in the world.\nAfter moving from Perthshire to Birmingham to set up business as a draper, McGregor became involved with local football club Aston Villa, which he helped to establish as one of the leading teams in England. He served the club for over 20 years in various capacities, including president, director and chairman. In 1888, frustrated by the regular cancellation of Villa's matches, McGregor organised a meeting of representatives of England's leading clubs, which led to the formation of the Football League, giving member clubs a guaranteed fixture list each season. This was instrumental in the transition of football from an amateur pastime to a professional business.\nMcGregor served as both chairman and president of the Football League and was also chairman of The Football Association (the FA). He was recognised by the FA for his service to the game shortly before his death in 1911, and was posthumously honoured by the local football authorities and Aston Villa.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBorn in Braco in Perthshire, Scotland, McGregor first became interested in football after watching a match between locals and visiting artisans at Ardoch. He served an apprenticeship as a draper in Perth, and in 1870, following the example of his brother Peter, moved to Birmingham, and opened his own drapery business in Aston, an area then just outside the city. Upon his arrival in the English Midlands he became involved with a local football club, Calthorpe F.C., which had been formed by a fellow Scot, Campbell Orr. McGregor was enthusiastic enough about the game to arrange for his shop to close early on Saturdays to allow him to watch matches, and he later sold football kits at the shop, which became a popular meeting place for football enthusiasts.\nMcGregor was married to Jessie, and the couple had a daughter and a son, also named Jessie and William. A teetotaller, McGregor was a supporter of the Temperance movement, and was active in the local branch of the Liberal Party until his membership lapsed in 1882 due to the increasing amount of time he devoted to football. He was involved in the early attempts to establish a baseball league in the United Kingdom, and served as the honorary treasurer of the Baseball Association of Great Britain and Ireland. Despite his commitment to sport, he continued his drapery business throughout his life.\nMcGregor was a committed Christian who was widely respected for his honesty and integrity. He worshipped for forty years at the Congregational church in Wheeler Street, Aston. His pastor, the Revd. W.G. Percival said that the best thing about him \"was not so much the genial, kindly, honest sportsman, but the Christian behind it all\". He described him as \"a man of absolutely unblemished personal character\".\n\n\n== Association with Aston Villa ==\n\nIn 1877, McGregor was invited to become a committee member of Aston Villa, a football club formed three years earlier. He also umpired matches for the club.[A] At the time the club played at Aston Park, close to the premises of McGregor's business. He became interested in joining Villa due to the strong Scottish contingent in the club's ranks, the team's exciting style of play, and the club's connection to a Wesleyan Chapel. He quickly assumed the post of club administrator, helping the impecunious club to survive its financial troubles. After some of Aston Villa's possessions were seized by bailiffs, McGregor allowed the club to use his shop as a store to prevent further seizures. Under McGregor's leadership, Aston Villa won their first trophy, the Birmingham Senior Cup, in 1880, shortly after which McGregor became the club's president.\nThe following year McGregor became a member of the club's board of directors. Villa's sta\nSamuel Liddell (or Liddel) MacGregor Mathers (8 or 11 January 1854 \u2013 5 or 20 November 1918), born Samuel Liddell Mathers, was a British occultist and member of the S.R.I.A.. He is primarily known as one of the founders of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, a ceremonial magic order of which offshoots still exist. He became so synonymous with the order that Golden Dawn scholar Israel Regardie observed in retrospect that \"the Golden Dawn was MacGregor Mathers.\"\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMathers was born on 8 or 11 January 1854 in Hackney, London, England. His father, William M. Mathers, died while he was still a boy. His mother, whose maiden name was Collins, died in 1885. He attended Bedford School and subsequently worked in Bournemouth as a clerk, before moving to London following the death of his mother.\nHis wife was Moina Mathers (n\u00e9e Mina Bergson), sister of the philosopher Henri Bergson.\n\n\n== Lifestyle ==\nMathers added the \"MacGregor\" surname as a claim to Highland Scottish heritage. He was a practising vegetarian, or (according to some accounts) vegan, an outspoken anti-vivisectionist, and a non-smoker. It is known that his main interests were magic and the theory of war, his first book being a translation of a French military manual, Practical Instruction in Infantry Campaigning Exercise (1884).\nMathers became increasingly eccentric in his later years as was noted by W. B. Yeats.\n\n\n=== Freemasonry ===\nMathers was introduced to Freemasonry by a neighbour, alchemist Frederick Holland, and was initiated into Hengist Lodge No.195 on 4 October 1877. He was raised as a Master Mason on 30 January 1878. In 1882 he was admitted to the Metropolitan College of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia as well as a number of fringe Masonic degrees. Working hard both for and in the SRIA he was awarded an honorary 8th Degree in 1886, and in the same year he lectured on the Kabbalah to the Theosophical Society. He became Celebrant of Metropolitan College in 1891 and was appointed as Junior Substitute Magus of the SRIA in 1892, in which capacity he served until 1900. He left the order in 1903, having failed to repay money which he had borrowed.\nIn 1891, Mathers assumed leadership of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn upon the death of William Robert Woodman. He moved with his wife to Paris on 21 May 1892. After his expulsion from the Golden Dawn in April 1900, Mathers formed a group in Paris in 1903 called Alpha et Omega (its headquarters, the Ahathoor Temple). Mathers chose the title \"Archon Basileus\".\n\n\n=== Translations ===\nMathers was a polyglot; among the languages he had studied were English, French, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Gaelic and Coptic, though he had a greater command of some languages than of others. His translations of such books as The Book of Abramelin (14th century), Christian Knorr von Rosenroth's The Kabbalah Unveiled (1684), Key of Solomon (anonymous, 14th century), The Lesser Key of Solomon (anonymous, 17th century), and the Grimoire of Armadel (17th century), while probably justly criticised with respect to quality, were responsible for making what had been obscure and inaccessible material widely available to the non-academic English-speaking world. They have had considerable influence on the development of occult and esoteric thought since their publication, as has his consolidation of the Enochian magical system of John Dee and Edward Kelley.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nIn addition to many supporters, he had many enemies and critics. One of his most notable enemies was one-time friend and pupil Aleister Crowley, who portrayed Mathers as a villain named SRMD in his 1917 novel Moonchild. According to Crowley's memoirs, The Confessions of Aleister Crowley, Mathers was in the habit of ostensibly playing chess matches against various pagan gods. Mathers would set up the chessboard and seat himself behind the white(s) pieces, with an empty chair opposite him. After making a move for himself, Mathers would then shade his eyes and peer tow\nIlmenite is a titanium-iron oxide mineral with the idealized formula FeTiO3. It is a weakly magnetic black or steel-gray solid.  Ilmenite is the most important ore of titanium and the main source of titanium dioxide, which is used in paints, printing inks, fabrics, plastics, paper, sunscreen, food and cosmetics.\n\n\n== Structure and properties ==\nIlmenite is a heavy (specific gravity 4.7), moderately hard (Mohs hardness 5.6 to 6), opaque black mineral with a submetallic luster. It is almost always massive, with thick tabular crystals being quite rare. It shows no discernible cleavage, breaking instead with a conchoidal to uneven fracture.\nIlmenite crystallizes in the trigonal system with space group R3. The ilmenite crystal structure consists of an ordered derivative of the corundum structure; in corundum all cations are identical but in ilmenite Fe2+ and Ti4+ ions occupy alternating layers perpendicular to the trigonal c axis.\nPure ilmenite is paramagnetic (showing only very weak attraction to a magnet), but ilmenite forms solid solutions with hematite that are weakly ferromagnetic and so are noticeably attracted to a magnet. Natural deposits of ilmenite usually contain intergrown or exsolved magnetite that also contribute to its ferromagnetism.\nIlmenite is distinguished from hematite by its less intensely black color and duller appearance and its black streak, and from magnetite by its weaker magnetism.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nIn 1791 William Gregor discovered a deposit of black sand in a stream that runs through the valley just south of the village of Manaccan (Cornwall), and identified for the first time titanium as one of the constituents of the main mineral in the sand. Gregor named this mineral manaccanite. The same mineral was found in the Ilmensky Mountains, near Miass, Russia, and named ilmenite.\n\n\n== Mineral chemistry ==\nPure ilmenite has the composition FeTiO3. However, ilmenite most often contains appreciable quantities of magnesium and manganese and up to 6 wt% of hematite, Fe2O3, substituting for FeTiO3 in the crystal structure. Thus the full chemical formula can be expressed as (Fe,Mg,Mn,Ti)O3. Ilmenite forms a solid solution with geikielite (MgTiO3) and pyrophanite (MnTiO3) which are magnesian and manganiferous end-members of the solid solution series.\nAlthough ilmenite is typically close to the ideal FeTiO3 composition, with minor mole percentages of Mn and Mg, the ilmenites of kimberlites usually contain substantial amounts of geikielite molecules, and in some highly differentiated felsic rocks ilmenites may contain significant amounts of pyrophanite molecules.\nAt temperatures above 950 \u00b0C (1,740 \u00b0F), there is a complete solid solution between ilmenite and hematite. There is a miscibility gap at lower temperatures, resulting in a coexistence of these two minerals in rocks but no solid solution. This coexistence may result in exsolution lamellae in cooled ilmenites with more iron in the system than can be homogeneously accommodated in the crystal lattice. Ilmenite containing 6 to 13 percent Fe2O3 is sometimes described as ferrian ilmenite.\nIlmenite alters or weathers to form the pseudo-mineral leucoxene, a fine-grained yellowish to grayish or brownish material enriched to 70% or more of TiO2. Leucoxene is an important source of titanium in heavy mineral sands ore deposits.\n\n\n== Paragenesis ==\nIlmenite is a common accessory mineral found in metamorphic and igneous rocks. It is found in large concentrations in layered intrusions where it forms as part of a cumulate layer within the intrusion. Ilmenite generally occurs in these cumulates together with orthopyroxene or in combination with plagioclase and apatite (nelsonite).\nMagnesian ilmenite is formed in kimberlites as part of the MARID association of minerals (mica-amphibole-rutile-ilmenite-diopside) assemblage of glimmerite xenoliths. Manganiferous ilmenite is found in granitic rocks and also in carbonatite int\nRobert Roy MacGregor (Scottish Gaelic: Raibeart Ruadh MacGriogair; 7 March 1671 \u2013 28 December 1734) was a Jacobite Scottish outlaw, who later became a Scottish and Catholic folk hero.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nRob Roy was born in the Kingdom of Scotland at Glengyle, at the head of Loch Katrine, as recorded in the baptismal register of Buchanan, Stirling. His parents were the local Clan MacGregor tacksman, Donald Glas MacGregor, and Margaret Campbell. He was also descended from the Clan MacDonald of Keppoch through his paternal grandmother.\nIn January 1693, at Corrie Arklet farm near Inversnaid, he married Mary MacGregor of Comar (1671\u20131745), who was born at Leny Farm, Strathyre. The couple had four sons: James Mor MacGregor (1695\u20131754), Ranald (1706\u20131786), Coll (died 1735) and Robert (1715\u20131754)\u2014known as Rob\u00ecn \u00d2ig or Young Rob. It has been argued that they also adopted a cousin named Duncan, but this is not certain.\n\n\n== Jacobite risings ==\nAlong with many Highland clansmen, at the age of eighteen Rob Roy MacGregor together with his father joined the Jacobite rising of 1689 led by John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee, and Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel, to support the Stuart King James VII, whose flight from Britain had been declared by the English Parliament  to be an abdication, following the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Although victorious in initial battles, Dundee was killed at the Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689, deflating the rebellion. MacGregor's father was taken to jail, where he was held on high treason charges for two years. MacGregor's mother Margaret's health failed during Donald's time in prison. By the time Donald was finally released, his wife was dead.\nLike many other Scottish clan chiefs during the 17th and 18th centuries, MacGregor operated an extralegal Watch over the cattle herds of the Lowland gentry in return for protection money, which was used to feed the families of his tenants and clansmen. Any cattle that were stolen from herds under his Watch were either retrieved or paid for in full.\nMacGregor became a respected cattleman\u2014this was a time when cattle raiding and selling protection against theft were commonplace means of earning a living. MacGregor borrowed a large sum to increase his own cattle herd, but owing to the disappearance of his chief herder, who was entrusted with the money, MacGregor defaulted on his loan.\nAs a result, he was branded an outlaw, and his wife and family were evicted from their house at Inversnaid, which was then burned down. After his principal creditor, James Graham, 1st Duke of Montrose, seized his lands, MacGregor waged a private blood feud against the Duke, both raiding his cattle and robbing his rents.\nAnother version of this series of events states that MacGregor's estates of Craigrostan and Ardess were forfeited for his part in the Jacobite rising of 1715. The Duke of Montrose acquired the property in 1720 by open purchase from the Commissioners of Enquiry.\n\n\n== Glen Shira ==\n\nIn 1716, MacGregor moved to Glen Shira for a short time and lived under the protection of John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll, also known as Red John of the Battles, \"Iain Ruaidh nan Cath\". Argyll negotiated an amnesty and protection for Rob and granted him permission to build a house in the Glen for the surrendering up of weapons. \"Traditionally the story goes that Argyll only received a large cache of rusty old weapons.\" A sporran and dirk handle which belonged to Rob Roy can still be seen at Inveraray Castle. Rob Roy only used this house occasionally for the next three or four years.\nIn July 1717, MacGregor and the whole of the Clan Gregor were specifically excluded from the benefits of the Indemnity Act 1717 which had the effect of pardoning all others who took part in the Jacobite rising of 1715.\nMacGregor participated in the Battle of Glen Shiel in 1719, in which a British Government army with allied Highlanders defeated a force of Jacobite Scots supported by the Spanish. Two of the Jacobite commanders\nWilliam McGregor Paxton (June 22, 1869 \u2013 1941) was an American painter and instructor who embraced the Boston School paradigm and was a co-founder of The Guild of Boston Artists. He taught briefly while a student at Cowles Art School, where he met his wife Elizabeth Okie Paxton, and at the Museum of Fine Arts School in Boston. Paxton is known for his portraits, including those of two presidents\u2014Grover Cleveland and Calvin Coolidge\u2014and interior scenes with women, including his wife. His works are in many museums in the United States.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHe was born on June 22, 1869, in Baltimore to James and Rose Doherty Paxton. William's father moved the Paxton family and established a catering business in Newton Corner, Massachusetts, in the mid-1870s.\n\n\n== Education ==\nPaxton attended Cowles Art School on a scholarship he attained at the age of 18. He studied with  Dennis Miller Bunker and Cowles and then went to Paris to study under Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me, at \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. Maryhill Museum of Art said he also studied at Acad\u00e9mie Julian in Paris. He returned to Cowles and studied with Joseph DeCamp, who also taught Elizabeth Vaughan Okie. She became Paxton's student and then his wife.\n\n\n== Marriage ==\nPaxton became engaged in 1896 to Elizabeth Vaughan Okie, and they married on January 3, 1899. They traveled to Europe together and often spent their summers on Cape Cod and Cape Ann. They lived in Newton, Massachusetts, first on Elmwood Street with his parents. About 1916 they resided or had a studio on Ipswich Street in Fenway Studios in Boston. They later purchased a house in Newton Center on Montvale Road.\nPaxton's wife managed his career \nand modeled for many of his works, like the painting in which she was dressed for the ball. \"William McGregor Paxton... benefited from an art-savvy wife who supported his career, using her energy in the bet that his offered the more secure future,\" said author and art historian Rena Tobey. The couple had no children.\n\n\n== Career ==\nPaxton taught from 1906 to 1913 at the Museum of Fine Arts School  and painted briefly at Fenway Studios in Boston.   He worked at the Harcourt Street Studios in Boston and when it burned in 1904 he lost close to 100 paintings.  He then went to the Fenway Studios for a brief period but then moved on to the Riverway Studios, also in Boston.  He is primarily known for his portraits and painted both Grover Cleveland and Calvin Coolidge. Maryhill Museum of Art says of his artistry, \"Paxton was well known for the attention he gave to the effects of light and detail in flesh and fabric. His works often present idealized views of women, such as this portrait (The Red Fan) of his wife Elizabeth\", like Henry James's portrayal of women in his novels The Portrait of a Lady (1881) or The American (1877). His models, often daughters and wives of his patrons, were depicted as refined, cultured women of \"conspicuous leisure\", and equated with the \"precious aesthetic objects surround them\", like the women of Thorstein Veblen's Theory of the Leisure Class (1899) who reflect the wealth of their husbands or fathers. He crafted elaborate compositions with models in his studio, using props that appear in several paintings.\nPaxton and several other Bostonian artists were inspired by Johannes Vermeer. The Metropolitan Museum of Art says of Paxton's Tea Leaves (1909) in their collection:\n\nIn a windowless parlor permeated by soft light, a dreamy atmosphere, and the sounds of silence, two elegant women pass the time by doing very little or nothing at all. Paxton hints at a narrative, but he asks that the viewer invent it, recapitulating the ambiguity of Vermeer's paintings, which he admired.\nPaxton employed a technique where only one area in his compositions was entirely in focus, while the rest was somewhat blurred, something he called \"binocular vision\" and credited to Vermeer. He began to employ this system in his own work, including The New Necklace, where only the gold beads are sha\nWilliam Bernard McGregor is an Australian linguist. As of 2024 he is professor in linguistics at Aarhus University in Denmark. \n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWilliam Bernard McGregor received his PhD degree from the University of Sydney in 1984. \n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter gaining his doctorate, McGregor had a number of positions through different institutions in Australia, before moving to Europe. He was appointed senior research fellow at KU Leuven in Belgium in 1998, and then visiting research fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen, Netherlands, for one and a half years. Since 2000, he has been full professor at Aarhus University.\nHe specialises in the description of mainly non-Pama-Nyungan Australian languages, and does descriptive linguistic work on Gooniyandi, Nyulnyul and Warrwa languages. Since 2010 he has also studied Shua, a language spoken in Botswana, in Africa. He works on theoretical and typological issues from within a variation of systemic functional linguistics dubbed \"semiotic grammar\", developed by him.\nApart from his own works on linguistics, McGregor has also published articles and book chapters about the work of other linguists in Australia, notably the work of German linguists and ethnographers such as Pallottine missionary Ernest Worms and his mentor, Hermann Nekes.\n\n\n== Recognition and honours ==\nMcGregor was elected fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities in 1999, and became a member of Academia Europaea in 2014. and\nIn 2010 he was honoured with the Danish honour, the Order of the Dannebrog, becoming a Knight of Dannebrog. \n\n\n== Other activities ==\nAs of September 2024 he serves on the editorial boards of the Australian Journal of Linguistics and Language and History.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nMcGregor, William B.

The most southerly point of the British mainland is near Lizard Point at SW 701115; Lizard village, also known as the Lizard, is the most southerly on the British mainland, and is in the civil parish of Landewednack, the most southerly parish. The valleys of the river Helford and Loe Pool form the northern boundary, with the rest of the peninsula surrounded by sea. The area measures about 14 by 14 miles (23 km \u00d7 23 km). The Lizard is one of England's natural regions and has been designated as a National Character Area 157 by Natural England. The peninsula is known for its geology and for its rare plants and lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).\nThe Lizard's coast is particularly hazardous to shipping and the seaways round the peninsula were historically known as the \"Graveyard of Ships\". The Lizard Lighthouse was built at Lizard Point in 1752 and the RNLI operates the Lizard lifeboat station.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Lizard\" is most probably a corruption of the Cornish name \"Lys Ardh\", meaning \"high court\"; it is purely coincidental that much of the peninsula is composed of serpentinite-bearing rock. The peninsula's original name may have been the Celtic Bridanoc, from Britannakon (\"the \"British one\"), preserved in the name of the former village of Predannack, now site of Predannack Airfield.\n\n\n== History ==\nThere is evidence of early habitation with several burial mounds and stones. Part of the peninsula is known as the Meneage (land of the monks).\nHelston, the nearest town to the Lizard peninsula, is said to have once headed the estuary of the River Cober, before it was cut off from the sea by Loe Bar in the 13th century. It is speculated that Helston was once a port, but no records exist. Geomorphologists believe the bar was most likely formed by rising sea levels, after the last ice age, blocking the river and creating a barrier beach. The beach is formed mostly of flint and the nearest source is found offshore under the drowned terraces of the former river that flowed between England and France, and now under the English Channel. The medieval port of Helston was at Gweek, possibly from around 1260 onward, on the Helford river which exported tin and copper. Helston was believed to be in existence in the sixth century, around the River Cober (Dowr Kohar).\nThe name comes from the Cornish \"hen lis\" or \"old court\" and \"ton\" added later to denote a Saxon manor; the Domesday Book refers to it as Henliston (which survives as the name of a road in the town). It was granted its charter by King John in 1201. It was here that tin ingots were weighed to determine the duty due to the Duke of Cornwall when a number of stannary towns were authorised by royal decree.\nThe royal manor of Winnianton, which was held by King William I at the time of the Domesday Book (1086), was also the head manor of the hundred of Kerrier and the largest estate in Cornwall. It was assessed as having fifteen hides before 1066. At the time of Domesday there was land for sixty ploughs, but in the lord's land there were two ploughs and in the lands held by villeins twenty-four ploughs. There were twenty-four villeins, forty-one freedmen, thirty-three smallholders and fourteen slaves. There was 6 acres (24,000 m2), eight square leagues of pasture and half a square league of woodland. The livestock was fourteen unbroken mares, three cattle and one hundred and twenty-eight sheep (in total 145 beasts); its value was \u00a312 annually. 11 of the hides were held by the Count of Mortain and there is more arable and pasture and 13 more persons are recorded: Rinsey, Trelowarren, Mawgan-in-Meneage and seventeen other lands are also recorded under Winnianton.\nMullion has the 15th century church of St Mellanus, and the Old Inn from the 16th century. The harbour was completed in 1895 and financed by Lord Robartes of Lanhydrock as a recompense to the fish", "metadata": {"title": "William Gregor", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gregor"}}
