{"page_content": "Titanium is a chemical element; it has symbol Ti and atomic number 22. Found in nature only as an oxide, it can be reduced to produce a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density, and high strength, resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia, and chlorine.\nTitanium was discovered in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791 and was named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth after the Titans of Greek mythology. The element occurs within a number of minerals, principally rutile and ilmenite, which are widely distributed in the Earth's crust and lithosphere; it is found in almost all living things, as well as bodies of water, rocks, and soils. The metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores by the Kroll and Hunter processes. The most common compound, titanium dioxide, is a popular photocatalyst and is used in the manufacture of white pigments. Other compounds include titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), a component of smoke screens and catalysts; and titanium trichloride (TiCl3), which is used as a catalyst in the production of polypropylene.\nTitanium can be alloyed with iron, aluminium, vanadium, and molybdenum, among other elements. The resulting titanium alloys are strong, lightweight, and versatile, with applications including aerospace (jet engines, missiles, and spacecraft), military, industrial processes (chemicals and petrochemicals, desalination plants, pulp, and paper), automotive, agriculture (farming), sporting goods, jewelry, and consumer electronics. Titanium is also considered one of the most biocompatible metals, leading to a range of medical applications including prostheses, orthopedic implants, dental implants, and surgical instruments.\nThe two most useful properties of the metal are corrosion resistance and strength-to-density ratio, the highest of any metallic element. In its unalloyed condition, titanium is as strong as some steels, but less dense. There are two allotropic forms and five naturally occurring isotopes of this element, 46Ti through 50Ti, with 48Ti being the most abundant (73.8%).\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Physical properties ===\nAs a metal, titanium is recognized for its high strength-to-weight ratio. It is a strong metal with low density that is quite ductile (especially in an oxygen-free environment), lustrous, and metallic-white in color. Due to its relatively high melting point (1,668 \u00b0C or 3,034 \u00b0F) it has sometimes been described as a refractory metal, but this is not the case. It is paramagnetic and has fairly low electrical and thermal conductivity compared to other metals. Titanium is superconducting when cooled below its critical temperature of 0.49 K.\n\nCommercially pure (99.2% pure) grades of titanium have ultimate tensile strength of about 434 MPa (63,000 psi), equal to that of common, low-grade steel alloys, but are less dense. Titanium is 60% denser than aluminium, but more than twice as strong as the most commonly used 6061-T6 aluminium alloy. Certain titanium alloys (e.g., Beta C) achieve tensile strengths of over 1,400 MPa (200,000 psi). However, titanium loses strength when heated above 430 \u00b0C (806 \u00b0F).\nTitanium is not as hard as some grades of heat-treated steel; it is non-magnetic and a poor conductor of heat and electricity. Machining requires precautions, because the material can gall unless sharp tools and proper cooling methods are used. Like steel structures, those made from titanium have a fatigue limit that guarantees longevity in some applications.\nThe metal is a dimorphic allotrope of a hexagonal close packed \u03b1 form that changes into a body-centered cubic (lattice) \u03b2 form at 882 \u00b0C (1,620 \u00b0F). The specific heat of the \u03b1 form increases dramatically as it is heated to this transition temperature but then falls and remains fairly constant for the \u03b2 form regardless of temperature.\n\n\n=== Chemical properties ===\n\nLike aluminium and magnesium, the surface of titanium metal and its alloys oxidize immediately upon exposure to air to form a thin non\nTitanium dioxide, also known as titanium(IV) oxide or titania , is the inorganic compound derived from titanium with the chemical formula TiO2. When used as a pigment, it is called titanium white, Pigment White 6 (PW6), or CI 77891. It is a white solid that is insoluble in water, although mineral forms can appear black. As a pigment, it has a wide range of applications, including paint, sunscreen, and food coloring. When used as a food coloring, it has E number E171. World production in 2014 exceeded 9 million tonnes. It has been estimated that titanium dioxide is used in two-thirds of all pigments, and pigments based on the oxide have been valued at a price of $13.2 billion.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nIn all three of its main dioxides, titanium exhibits octahedral geometry, being bonded to six oxide anions.  The oxides in turn are bonded to three Ti centers.  The overall crystal structures of rutile and anatase are tetragonal in symmetry whereas brookite is orthorhombic. The oxygen substructures are all slight distortions of close packing: in rutile, the oxide anions are arranged in distorted hexagonal close-packing, whereas they are close to cubic close-packing in anatase and to \"double hexagonal close-packing\" for brookite. The rutile structure is widespread for other metal dioxides and difluorides, e.g. RuO2 and ZnF2.\nMolten titanium dioxide has a local structure in which each Ti is coordinated to, on average, about 5 oxygen atoms. This is distinct from the crystalline forms in which Ti coordinates to 6 oxygen atoms.\n\n\n== Synthetic and geologic occurrence ==\nSynthetic TiO2 is mainly produced from the mineral ilmenite.  Rutile, and anatase, naturally occurring TiO2, occur widely also, e.g. rutile as a 'heavy mineral' in beach sand. Leucoxene, fine-grained anatase formed by natural alteration of ilmenite, is yet another ore. Star sapphires and rubies get their asterism from oriented inclusions of rutile needles.\n\n\n=== Mineralogy and uncommon polymorphs ===\nTitanium dioxide occurs in nature as the minerals rutile and anatase.  Additionally two high-pressure forms are known minerals: a monoclinic baddeleyite-like form known as akaogiite, and the other has a slight monoclinic distortion of the orthorhombic \u03b1-PbO2 structure and is known as riesite. Both of which can be found at the Ries crater in Bavaria. It is mainly sourced from ilmenite, which is the most widespread titanium dioxide-bearing ore around the world. Rutile is the next most abundant and contains around 98% titanium dioxide in the ore. The metastable anatase and brookite phases convert irreversibly to the equilibrium rutile phase upon heating above temperatures in the range 600\u2013800 \u00b0C (1,110\u20131,470 \u00b0F).\nTitanium dioxide has twelve known polymorphs \u2013 in addition to rutile, anatase, brookite, akaogiite and riesite, three metastable phases can be produced synthetically (monoclinic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic ramsdellite-like), and four high-pressure forms (\u03b1-PbO2-like, cotunnite-like, orthorhombic OI, and cubic phases) also exist:\n\nThe cotunnite-type phase was claimed to be the hardest known oxide with the Vickers hardness of 38 GPa and the bulk modulus of 431 GPa (i.e. close to diamond's value of 446 GPa) at atmospheric pressure. However, later studies came to different conclusions with much lower values for both the hardness (7\u201320 GPa, which makes it softer than common oxides like corundum Al2O3 and rutile TiO2) and bulk modulus (~300 GPa).\nTitanium dioxide (B) is found as a mineral in magmatic rocks and hydrothermal veins, as well as weathering rims on perovskite. TiO2 also forms lamellae in other minerals.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nThe largest TiO2 pigment processors are Chemours, Venator, Kronos, and Tronox. Major paint and coating company end users for pigment grade titanium dioxide include Akzo Nobel, PPG Industries, Sherwin Williams, BASF, Kansai Paints and Valspar. Global TiO2 pigment demand for 2010 was 5.3 Mt with annual growth expected to be about 3\u20134%.\n\nThe production \nTitanium oxide may refer to:\n\nTitanium dioxide (titanium(IV) oxide), TiO2\nTitanium(II) oxide (titanium monoxide), TiO, a non-stoichiometric oxide\nTitanium(III) oxide (dititanium trioxide), Ti2O3\nTi3O\nTi2O\n\u03b4-TiOx (x= 0.68\u20130.75)\nTinO2n\u22121 where n ranges from 3\u20139 inclusive, e.g. Ti3O5, Ti4O7, etc.\n\n\n== Reduced titanium oxides ==\nA common reduced titanium oxide is TiO, also known as titanium monoxide. It can be prepared from titanium dioxide and titanium metal at 1500 \u00b0C.\nTi3O5, Ti4O7, and Ti5O9 are non-stoichiometric oxides. These compounds are typically formed at high temperatures in the presence of excess oxygen. As a result, they exhibit unique structural and electronic properties, and have been studied for their potential use in various applications, including in gas sensors, lithium-ion batteries, and photocatalysis.\n\n\n== References ==\nTitanium white is a family of white pigments composed primarily of titanium dioxide. It is the most widely used white pigment in contemporary artistic applications because of its affordability, low toxicity, and high hiding power. Though the term titanium white most often refers to pigments containing titanium dioxide, it can also describe any white pigment that contains a titanium compound (e.g. zinc titanate, barium titanate, potassium titanate, titanium lithopone, titanium silicate).:\u200a295\u200a\n\n\n== History ==\nTitanium dioxide (TiO2) is a bright white substance first named and created in a laboratory in the late 1800s. It is  called titanium white, Pigment White 6 or CI 77891 when used specifically as a pigment in paints and was initially used as a pigment in the ceramic arts for yellow glazes.\nThe pigment was further developed for industrial use in the 1910s by the Titanium Pigment Company in the United States and the Titan Company in Norway, each working independently. The two manufactures cross-licensed their patents in 1920.:\u200a297\u200a By the late 1920s, titanium and zinc white had unseated lead white as the dominant product in the market for white pigment. Most art supply companies now explicitly advise that titanium white should be used instead of lead white for safety reasons.\n\n\n== Visual characteristics ==\nTitianium white provides greater hiding power and tinting strength than any other white pigment. Titanium white was initially more expensive to produce than lead white, but its superior hiding power soon made it a more economical choice because smaller quantities were required to achieve the same degree of opacity.:\u200a309\u200a\n\n\n== Notable occurrences ==\nTitanium white featured regularly in the palette of Arthur Dove, who was among its earliest adopters in the 1920s. It has also been identified in the work of Thomas Hart Benton, Diego Rivera, Pablo Picasso, and Jackson Pollock.\n\n\n== References ==\n\"Titanium\" is a song by French DJ and record producer David Guetta, featuring vocals by Australian singer and songwriter Sia. Taken from Guetta's fifth studio album, Nothing but the Beat, the song was written by Sia, Guetta, Giorgio Tuinfort and Afrojack. Production was also handled by Guetta, Tuinfort and Afrojack. \"Titanium\" was initially released for digital download on 25 August 2011, as the first of four promotional singles from the album. It was later released as the album's fourth single in 2011. The song originally featured the vocals of American recording artist Mary J. Blige, whose version of the song leaked online in 2011.\n\"Titanium\" is a pop song which draws from the genres of house and urban-dance. The song's lyrics are about inner strength. Critics were positive towards the song and noted it as one of the standout tracks from Nothing but the Beat. Sia's vocals received comparisons to those of Fergie and the song was also musically compared to Coldplay's work. \"Titanium\" attained top 10 positions in several major music markets, including Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States. In the United Kingdom, it peaked at number one, becoming Guetta's fifth number-one single on the chart and Sia's first.\nThe song's accompanying music video premiered on 20 December 2011 but does not feature appearances by Guetta or Sia, instead it focuses on a young boy with supernatural powers, played by actor Ryan Lee. On 12 August 2012, the music video was reused for a Spanish language version of the song.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\"Titanium\" was written by Sia, David Guetta, Giorgio Tuinfort and Afrojack. Production was also handled by Guetta, Tuinfort and Afrojack. After discovering Sia's music online, Guetta picked her to appear on his fifth studio album, Nothing but the Beat. Guetta told an insider from Los Angeles, \"I was totally amazed by Sia ... This has made me more curious to study her music more because I was really impressed. I have the biggest people on the album and she has a different profile, more like an indie kind of artist and it makes her song even more special, it makes it stand out I think.\"\nThe song originally featured vocals from American recording artist Mary J. Blige, whose version of the song leaked online in July 2011. In an interview with News.com.au, Guetta said of the leak, \"You shouldn't even know about that ... I'd rather not speak about it.\" Sia recorded a demo of the song, which was then sent to Blige and other artists. American pop singer Katy Perry was the first person to be offered the track but turned it down because she felt its message was too similar to that of her song \"Firework\". An insider told Take 40 Australia, \"So that 'Titanium' song, Sia wrote it for Katy, but [Katy] didn't want to do a song with Guetta ... \" According to Sia's manager, Jonathan Daniel of Crush Management, Sia wrote the song for American R&B singer Alicia Keys. Guetta considered approaching other female singers to record on the song, however Perry advised him to keep Sia on the track. Eventually, Guetta decided to release Sia's version. He explained, \"The first time I heard what Sia did ... I fell in love with it ... I didn't even want to give it to anyone else; it was perfect the way it was. It's not only about how big you are in America, it's about the song and the voice.\" Sia later revealed that Guetta did not tell her that her vocals would be released, saying, \"And then he took [Blige's] vocal off it, and put my vocal back on, my demo vocal, without asking and released it. And I never even knew it was gonna happen, and I was really upset. Because I had just retired, I was trying to be a pop songwriter, not an artist.\"\n\"Titanium\" was released for digital download on 8 August 2011, the first of four promotional singles from the album, as part of the iTunes Store's countdown to the album's relea\nTitanium fluoride can refer to\n\nTitanium(III) fluoride (titanium trifluoride, TiF3), a violet to purple-red solid\nTitanium(IV) fluoride (titanium tetrafluoride, TiF4), a white hygroscopic solid with polymeric structure\nNaturally occurring titanium (22Ti) is composed of five stable isotopes; 46Ti, 47Ti, 48Ti, 49Ti and 50Ti with 48Ti being the most abundant (73.8% natural abundance). Twenty-one radioisotopes have been characterized, with the most stable being 44Ti with a half-life of 60 years, 45Ti with a half-life of 184.8 minutes, 51Ti with a half-life of 5.76 minutes, and 52Ti with a half-life of 1.7 minutes. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 33 seconds, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than half a second.\nThe isotopes of titanium range in atomic mass from 39.00 u (39Ti) to 64.00 u (64Ti). The primary decay mode for isotopes lighter than the stable isotopes (lighter than 46Ti) is \u03b2+ and the primary mode for the heavier ones (heavier than 50Ti) is \u03b2\u2212; their respective decay products are scandium isotopes and the primary products after are vanadium isotopes.\n\n\n== List of isotopes ==\n\n\n== Titanium-44 ==\nTitanium-44 (44Ti) is a radioactive isotope of titanium that undergoes electron capture to an excited state of scandium-44 with a half-life of 60 years, before the ground state of 44Sc and ultimately 44Ca are populated. Because titanium-44 can only undergo electron capture, its half-life increases with ionization and it becomes stable in its fully ionized state (that is, having a charge of +22).\nTitanium-44 is produced in relative abundance in the alpha process in stellar nucleosynthesis and the early stages of supernova explosions. It is produced when calcium-40 fuses with an alpha particle (helium-4 nucleus) in a star's high-temperature environment; the resulting 44Ti nucleus can then fuse with another alpha particle to form chromium-48. The age of supernovae may be determined through measurements of gamma-ray emissions from titanium-44 and its abundance. It was observed in the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant and SN 1987A at a relatively high concentration, a consequence of delayed decay resulting from ionizing conditions.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nIsotope masses from:\nAudi, Georges; Bersillon, Olivier; Blachot, Jean; Wapstra, Aaldert Hendrik (2003), \"The NUBASE evaluation of nuclear and decay properties\", Nuclear Physics A, 729: 3\u2013128, Bibcode:2003NuPhA.729....3A, doi:10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001\nIsotopic compositions and standard atomic masses from:\nde Laeter, John Robert; B\u00f6hlke, John Karl; De Bi\u00e8vre, Paul; Hidaka, Hiroshi; Peiser, H.

ISBN 978-0-8493-0485-9.\nTitanium hydride normally refers to the inorganic compound TiH2 and related nonstoichiometric materials. It is commercially available as a stable grey/black powder, which is used as an additive in the production of Alnico sintered magnets, in the sintering of powdered metals, the production of metal foam, the production of powdered titanium metal and in pyrotechnics.\nAlso known as titanium\u2013hydrogen alloy, it is an alloy of titanium, hydrogen, and possibly other elements. When hydrogen is the main alloying element, its content in the titanium hydride is between 0.02% and 4.0% by weight. Alloying elements intentionally added to modify the characteristics of titanium hydride include gallium, iron, vanadium, and aluminium.\n\n\n== Production ==\nIn the commercial process for producing non-stoichiometric TiH2\u2212x, titanium metal sponge is treated with hydrogen gas at atmospheric pressure at between 300-500 \u00b0C. Absorption of hydrogen is exothermic and rapid, changing the color of the sponge grey/black. The brittle product is ground to a powder, which has a composition around TiH1.95. In the laboratory, titanium hydride is produced by heating titanium powder under flowing hydrogen at 700 \u00b0C, the idealized equation being:\n\nTi + H2 \u2192 TiH2\nOther methods of producing titanium hydride include electrochemical and ball milling methods.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nTiH1.95 is unaffected by water and air. It is slowly attacked by strong acids and is degraded by hydrofluoric and hot sulfuric acids. It reacts rapidly with oxidizing agents, this reactivity leading to the use of titanium hydride in pyrotechnics.\nThe material has been used to produce highly pure hydrogen, which is released upon heating the solid. Hydrogen release in TiH~2 starts just above 400 \u00b0C but may not be complete until the melting point of titanium metal. Titanium tritide (Ti3Hx) has been proposed for long-term storage of tritium gas.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nAs TiHx approaches stoichiometry, it adopts a distorted body-centered tetragonal structure, termed the \u03b5-form with an axial ratio of less than 1. This composition is very unstable with respect to partial thermal decomposition, unless maintained under a pure hydrogen atmosphere. Otherwise, the composition rapidly decomposes at room temperature until an approximate composition of TiH1.74 is reached. This composition adopts the fluorite structure, and is termed the \u03b4-form, and only very slowly thermally decomposing at room temperature until an approximate composition of TiH1.47 is reached, at which point, inclusions of the hexagonal close packed \u03b1-form, which is the same form as pure titanium, begin to appear.\nThe evolution of the dihydride from titanium metal and hydrogen has been examined in some detail. \u03b1-Titanium has a hexagonal close packed (hcp) structure at room temperature. Hydrogen initially occupies tetrahedral interstitial sites in the titanium. As the H/Ti ratio approaches 2, the material adopts the \u03b2-form to a face centred cubic (fcc), \u03b4-form, the H atoms eventually filling all the tetrahedral sites to give the limiting stoichiometry of TiH2. The various phases are described in the table below.\n\nIf titanium hydride contains 4.0% hydrogen at less than around 40 \u00b0C then it transforms into a body-centred tetragonal (bct) structure called \u03b5-titanium.\nWhen titanium hydrides with less than 1.3% hydrogen, known as hypoeutectoid titanium hydride are cooled, the \u03b2-titanium phase of the mixture attempts to revert to the \u03b1-titanium phase, resulting in an excess of hydrogen. One way for hydrogen to leave the \u03b2-titanium phase is for the titanium to partially transform into \u03b4-titanium, leaving behind titanium that is low enough in hydrogen to take the form of \u03b1-titanium, resulting in an \u03b1-titanium matrix with \u03b4-titanium inclusions.\nA metastable \u03b3-titanium hydride phase has been reported. When \u03b1-titanium hydride with a hydrogen content of 0.02-0.06% is quenched rapidly, it forms into \u03b3-titanium hydride, as the atoms \"freeze\" in place when the cell\nTitanium alloys are alloys that contain a mixture of titanium and other chemical elements. Such alloys have very high tensile strength and toughness (even at extreme temperatures). They are light in weight, have extraordinary corrosion resistance and the ability to withstand extreme temperatures. However, the high cost of processing limits their use to military applications, aircraft, spacecraft, bicycles, medical devices, jewelry, highly stressed components such as connecting rods on expensive sports cars and some premium sports equipment and consumer electronics.\nAlthough \"commercially pure\" titanium has acceptable mechanical properties and has been used for orthopedic and dental implants, for most applications titanium is alloyed with small amounts of aluminium and vanadium, typically 6% and 4% respectively, by weight. This mixture has a solid solubility which varies dramatically with temperature, allowing it to undergo precipitation strengthening. This heat treatment process is carried out after the alloy has been worked into its final shape but before it is put to use, allowing much easier fabrication of a high-strength product.\n\n\n== Categories ==\n\nTitanium alloys are generally classified into four main categories, with a miscellaneous catch-all the fifth.\n\nAlpha alloys which contain neutral alloying elements (such as tin) and/ or alpha stabilisers (such as aluminium or oxygen) only. These are not heat treatable. Examples include: Ti-5Al-2Sn-ELI, Ti-8Al-1Mo-1V.\nNear-alpha alloys contain small amount of ductile beta-phase. Besides alpha-phase stabilisers, near-alpha alloys are alloyed with 1\u20132% of beta phase stabilizers such as molybdenum, silicon or vanadium. Examples include: Ti-6Al-2Sn-4Zr-2Mo, Ti-5Al-5Sn-2Zr-2Mo, IMI 685, Ti 1100.\nAlpha and beta alloys, which are metastable and generally include some combination of both alpha and beta stabilisers, and which can be heat treated. Examples include: Ti-6Al-4V, Ti-6Al-4V-ELI, Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn, Ti-6Al-7Nb, and Ti62A\nBeta and near beta alloys, which are metastable and which contain sufficient beta stabilisers (such as molybdenum, silicon and vanadium) to allow them to maintain the beta phase when quenched, and which can also be solution treated and aged to improve strength. Examples include: Ti-10V-2Fe-3Al, Ti\u201329Nb\u201313Ta\u20134.6Zr, Ti-13V-11Cr-3Al, Ti-8Mo-8V-2Fe-3Al, Beta C, Ti-15-3.\nAlthough uncommercialized in the west, binary titanium alloys with magnesium, potassium, calcium, lithium have been produced in an arc melting pressure vessel at up to 140 atmospheres.\n\n\n=== Alpha-titanium ===\n\n\n=== Beta-titanium ===\nBeta titanium alloys exhibit the BCC allotropic form of titanium (called beta). Elements used in this alloy are one or more of the following other than titanium in varying amounts. These are molybdenum, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, zirconium, manganese, iron, chromium, cobalt, nickel, and copper.\nBeta titanium alloys have excellent formability and can be easily welded.\nBeta titanium is nowadays largely utilized in the orthodontic field and was adopted for orthodontics use in the 1980s. This type of alloy replaced stainless steel for certain uses, as stainless steel had dominated orthodontics since the 1960s. It has strength/modulus of elasticity ratios almost twice those of 18-8 austenitic stainless steel, larger elastic deflections in springs, and reduced force per unit displacement 2.2 times below those of stainless steel appliances.\nSome of the beta titanium alloys can convert to hard and brittle hexagonal omega-titanium at cryogenic temperatures or under influence of ionizing radiation.\n\n\n=== Omega-titanium ===\n\n\n== Transition temperature ==\nThe crystal structure of titanium at ambient temperature and pressure is close-packed hexagonal \u03b1 phase with a c/a ratio of 1.587. At about 890 \u00b0C, the titanium undergoes an allotropic transformation to a body-centred cubic \u03b2 phase which remains stable to the melting temperature.\nSome alloying elements, called alpha stabilizers, rais\nTitanium nitride (TiN; sometimes known as tinite) is an extremely hard ceramic material, often used as a physical vapor deposition (PVD) coating on titanium alloys, steel, carbide, and aluminium components to improve the substrate's surface properties.\nApplied as a thin coating, TiN is used to harden and protect cutting and sliding surfaces, for decorative purposes (for its golden appearance), and as a non-toxic exterior for medical implants. In most applications a coating of less than  5 micrometres (0.00020 in)  is applied.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nTiN has a Vickers hardness of 1800\u20132100, hardness of 31\u00b14 GPa, a modulus of elasticity of 550\u00b150 GPa, a thermal expansion coefficient of 9.35\u00d710\u22126 K\u22121, and a superconducting transition temperature of 5.6 K.\nTiN oxidizes at 800 \u00b0C in a normal atmosphere. It is chemically stable at 20 \u00b0C, according to laboratory tests, but can be slowly attacked by concentrated acid solutions with rising temperatures. TiN has a brown color and appears gold when applied as a coating. Depending on the substrate material and surface finish, TiN has a coefficient of friction ranging from 0.4 to 0.9 against another TiN surface (non-lubricated). The typical TiN formation has a crystal structure of NaCl type with a roughly 1:1 stoichiometry; TiNx compounds with x ranging from 0.6 to 1.2 are, however, thermodynamically stable.\nTiN becomes superconducting at cryogenic temperatures, with critical temperature up to 6.0 K for single crystals. Superconductivity in thin-film TiN has been studied extensively, with the superconducting properties strongly varying depending on sample preparation, up to complete suppression of superconductivity at a superconductor\u2013insulator transition. A thin film of TiN was chilled to near absolute zero, converting it into the first known superinsulator, with resistance suddenly increasing by a factor of 100,000.\n\n\n== Natural occurrence ==\nOsbornite is a very rare natural form of titanium nitride, found almost exclusively in meteorites.\n\n\n== Uses ==\n\nA well-known use for TiN coating is for edge retention and corrosion resistance on machine tooling, such as drill bits and milling cutters, often improving their lifetime by a factor of three or more.\nBecause of the metallic gold color of TiN, this material is used to coat costume jewelry and automotive trim for decorative purposes. TiN is also widely used as a top-layer coating, usually with nickel- or chromium-plated substrates, on consumer plumbing fixtures and door hardware. As a coating, it is used in aerospace and military applications and to protect the sliding surfaces of suspension forks of bicycles and motorcycles, as well as the shock shafts of radio-controlled cars. TiN is also used as a protective coating on the moving parts of many rifles and semi-automatic firearms, as it is extremely durable. As well as being durable, it is also extremely smooth, making removing the carbon build-up extremely easy. TiN is non-toxic, meets FDA guidelines, and has seen use in medical devices such as scalpel blades and orthopedic bone-saw blades, where sharpness and edge retention are important. TiN coatings have also been used in implanted prostheses (especially hip replacement implants) and other medical implants.\nThough less visible, thin films of TiN are also used in microelectronics, where they serve as a conductive connection between the active device and the metal contacts used to operate the circuit, while acting as a diffusion barrier to block the diffusion of the metal into the silicon. In this context, TiN is classified as a \"barrier metal\" (electrical resistivity ~ 25 \u03bc\u03a9\u00b7cm), even though it is clearly a ceramic from the perspective of chemistry or mechanical behavior. Recent chip design in the 45 nm technology and beyond also makes use of TiN as a \"metal\" for improved transistor performance. In combination with gate dielectrics (e.g. HfSiO4) that have a higher permittivity compared to standard SiO2, the gate length can be scaled do\nTitanium tetrachloride is the inorganic compound with the formula TiCl4. It is an important intermediate in the production of titanium metal and the pigment titanium dioxide. TiCl4 is a volatile liquid. Upon contact with humid air, it forms thick clouds of titanium dioxide (TiO2) and hydrochloric acid, a reaction that was formerly exploited for use in smoke machines. It is sometimes referred to as \"tickle\" or \"tickle 4\", as a phonetic representation of the symbols of its molecular formula (TiCl4).\n\n\n== Properties and structure ==\nTiCl4 is a dense, colourless liquid, although crude samples may be yellow or even red-brown. It is one of the rare transition metal halides that is a liquid at room temperature, VCl4 being another example. This property reflects the fact that molecules of TiCl4 weakly self-associate. Most metal chlorides are polymers, wherein the chloride atoms bridge between the metals. Its melting point is similar to that of CCl4.\nTi4+ has a \"closed\" electronic shell, with the same number of electrons as the noble gas argon. The tetrahedral structure for TiCl4 is consistent with its description as a d0 metal center (Ti4+) surrounded by four identical ligands. This configuration leads to highly symmetrical structures, hence the tetrahedral shape of the molecule. TiCl4 adopts similar structures to TiBr4 and TiI4; the three compounds share many similarities. TiCl4 and TiBr4 react to give mixed halides TiCl4\u2212xBrx, where x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Magnetic resonance measurements also indicate that halide exchange is also rapid between TiCl4 and VCl4.\nTiCl4 is soluble in toluene and chlorocarbons. Certain arenes form complexes of the type [(C6R6)TiCl3]+. TiCl4 reacts exothermically with donor solvents such as THF to give hexacoordinated adducts. Bulkier ligands (L) give pentacoordinated adducts TiCl4L.\n\n\n== Production ==\nTiCl4 is produced by the chloride process, which involves the reduction of titanium oxide ores, typically ilmenite (FeTiO3), with carbon under flowing chlorine at 900 \u00b0C. Impurities are removed by distillation.\n\n2 FeTiO3 + 7 Cl2 + 6 C \u2192 2 TiCl4 + 2 FeCl3 + 6 CO\nThe coproduction of FeCl3 is undesirable, which has motivated the development of alternative technologies. Instead of directly using ilmenite, \"rutile slag\" is used. This material, an impure form of TiO2, is derived from ilmenite by removal of iron, either using carbon reduction or extraction with sulfuric acid. Crude TiCl4 contains a variety of other volatile halides, including vanadyl chloride (VOCl3), silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4), and tin tetrachloride (SnCl4), which must be separated.\n\n\n== Applications ==\n\n\n=== Production of titanium metal ===\nThe world's supply of titanium metal, about 250,000 tons per year, is made from TiCl4. The conversion involves the reduction of the tetrachloride with magnesium metal. This procedure is known as the Kroll process:\n\n2 Mg + TiCl4 \u2192 2 MgCl2 + Ti\nIn the Hunter process, liquid sodium is the reducing agent instead of magnesium.\n\n\n=== Production of titanium dioxide ===\nAround 90% of the TiCl4 production is used to make the pigment titanium dioxide (TiO2). The conversion involves hydrolysis of TiCl4, a process that forms hydrogen chloride:\n\nTiCl4 + 2 H2O \u2192 TiO2 + 4 HCl\nIn some cases, TiCl4 is oxidised directly with oxygen:\n\nTiCl4 + O2 \u2192 TiO2 + 2 Cl2\n\n\n=== Smoke screens ===\nIt has been used to produce smoke screens since it produces a heavy, white smoke that has little tendency to rise. \"Tickle\" was the standard means of producing on-set smoke effects for motion pictures, before being phased out in the 1980s due to concerns about hydrated HCl's effects on the respiratory system.\n\n\n== Chemical reactions ==\nTitanium tetrachloride is a versatile reagent that forms diverse derivatives including those illustrated below.\n\n\n=== Alcoholysis and related reactions ===\nA characteristic reaction of TiCl4 is its easy hydrolysis, signaled by the release of HCl vapors and titanium oxides and oxychlorides. Titanium tetrachloride has bee\nIlmenite is a titanium-iron oxide mineral with the idealized formula FeTiO3. It is a weakly magnetic black or steel-gray solid.  Ilmenite is the most important ore of titanium and the main source of titanium dioxide, which is used in paints, printing inks, fabrics, plastics, paper, sunscreen, food and cosmetics.\n\n\n== Structure and properties ==\nIlmenite is a heavy (specific gravity 4.7), moderately hard (Mohs hardness 5.6 to 6), opaque black mineral with a submetallic luster. It is almost always massive, with thick tabular crystals being quite rare. It shows no discernible cleavage, breaking instead with a conchoidal to uneven fracture.\nIlmenite crystallizes in the trigonal system with space group R3. The ilmenite crystal structure consists of an ordered derivative of the corundum structure; in corundum all cations are identical but in ilmenite Fe2+ and Ti4+ ions occupy alternating layers perpendicular to the trigonal c axis.\nPure ilmenite is paramagnetic (showing only very weak attraction to a magnet), but ilmenite forms solid solutions with hematite that are weakly ferromagnetic and so are noticeably attracted to a magnet. Natural deposits of ilmenite usually contain intergrown or exsolved magnetite that also contribute to its ferromagnetism.\nIlmenite is distinguished from hematite by its less intensely black color and duller appearance and its black streak, and from magnetite by its weaker magnetism.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nIn 1791 William Gregor discovered a deposit of black sand in a stream that runs through the valley just south of the village of Manaccan (Cornwall), and identified for the first time titanium as one of the constituents of the main mineral in the sand. Gregor named this mineral manaccanite. The same mineral was found in the Ilmensky Mountains, near Miass, Russia, and named ilmenite.\n\n\n== Mineral chemistry ==\nPure ilmenite has the composition FeTiO3. However, ilmenite most often contains appreciable quantities of magnesium and manganese and up to 6 wt% of hematite, Fe2O3, substituting for FeTiO3 in the crystal structure. Thus the full chemical formula can be expressed as (Fe,Mg,Mn,Ti)O3. Ilmenite forms a solid solution with geikielite (MgTiO3) and pyrophanite (MnTiO3) which are magnesian and manganiferous end-members of the solid solution series.\nAlthough ilmenite is typically close to the ideal FeTiO3 composition, with minor mole percentages of Mn and Mg, the ilmenites of kimberlites usually contain substantial amounts of geikielite molecules, and in some highly differentiated felsic rocks ilmenites may contain significant amounts of pyrophanite molecules.\nAt temperatures above 950 \u00b0C (1,740 \u00b0F), there is a complete solid solution between ilmenite and hematite. There is a miscibility gap at lower temperatures, resulting in a coexistence of these two minerals in rocks but no solid solution. This coexistence may result in exsolution lamellae in cooled ilmenites with more iron in the system than can be homogeneously accommodated in the crystal lattice. Ilmenite containing 6 to 13 percent Fe2O3 is sometimes described as ferrian ilmenite.\nIlmenite alters or weathers to form the pseudo-mineral leucoxene, a fine-grained yellowish to grayish or brownish material enriched to 70% or more of TiO2. Leucoxene is an important source of titanium in heavy mineral sands ore deposits.\n\n\n== Paragenesis ==\nIlmenite is a common accessory mineral found in metamorphic and igneous rocks. It is found in large concentrations in layered intrusions where it forms as part of a cumulate layer within the intrusion. Ilmenite generally occurs in these cumulates together with orthopyroxene or in combination with plagioclase and apatite (nelsonite).\nMagnesian ilmenite is formed in kimberlites as part of the MARID association of minerals (mica-amphibole-rutile-ilmenite-diopside) assemblage of glimmerite xenoliths. Manganiferous ilmenite is found in granitic rocks and also in carbonatite int\nTitanium SDK is an open-source framework that allows the creation of native mobile applications on platforms iOS and Android from a single JavaScript codebase. It is presently developed by non-profit software foundation TiDev, Inc.\nIn February 2013, Business Insider estimated that 10% of all smartphones worldwide ran Titanium-built apps. As of 2017, Titanium had amassed over 950,000 developer registrations.\nThe core component of the Titanium software ecosystem is the Apache-licensed software development kit, Titanium SDK. Alloy, a Titanium-based model\u2013view\u2013controller framework, is a related project presently maintained and developed by TiDev, Inc for use with the Titanium SDK.\nTitanium SDK was originally developed and maintained by Appcelerator, Inc, then later by Axway, Inc after Axway purchased Appcelerator in 2016. Today the Titanium SDK and related projects are developer-maintained under direction of non-profit Alabama corporation TiDev, Inc. based in Centreville, Alabama.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhen it was introduced in December 2008, Titanium was intended for developing cross-platform desktop applications and was sometimes compared to Adobe Air. However, it added support for developing iPhone and Android mobile applications in June 2009, and in 2012, Titanium Desktop was spun off into a separate, community-driven project named TideSDK. Support for developing iPad-based tablet apps was added in April 2010. BlackBerry support was announced in June 2010, and has been in beta since April 2013. Tizen support was also added in April 2013 with the 3.1.0 Titanium Studio and SDK releases. The latest addition to the platform in 2016 has been Hyperloop, a technology to access native API's on iOS, Android and Windows with JavaScript.\nIn April 2010, Appcelerator expanded the Titanium product line with the Titanium Tablet SDK. The Titanium Tablet SDK draws heavily from the existing support for iPhone, but it also includes native support for iPad-only user interface controls such as split views and popovers. Initially the mobile SDK only supported development for iPad, but support now includes Android-based tablets as well.\nIn June 2011, Appcelerator released Studio and Titanium Mobile 1.7. Studio is a full open standards IDE that is derived from Aptana Studio which Appcelerator acquired in January 2011.\nIn June 2013, Jeff Haynie, Appcelerator's CEO, announced that the company had begun Ti.Next, a project to rewrite the Titanium SDK in Javascript for improved performance and to bring Titanium's end users, who write in Javascript, closer to the internal code.\nIn January 2016, Appcelerator was acquired by Axway, a global software company with more than 11,000 public- and private-sector customers in 100 countries. Since then, the  Indie plans have been made free again, including native API access with Hyperloop.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe core features of Titanium SDK include:\n\nA cross-platform API for accessing native UI components such as navigation bars, menus, and dialog boxes and native device functionality including the file system, network, geolocation, accelerometer, and maps.\nTransparent access to native functionality covered by Hyperloop and native modules.\nMVC-based framework Alloy\nAll application source code gets deployed to the mobile device where it is interpreted using a JavaScript engine; Mozilla's Rhino is used on Android, BlackBerry, and Apple's JavascriptCore is used on iOS. In 2011 it was announced that a port to Google's V8 JavaScript engine is in development which, when complete, will significantly improve performance. Program loading takes longer than it does for programs developed with the native SDKs, as the interpreter and all required libraries must be loaded before interpreting the source code on the device can begin.\nTitanium provides APIs for:\n\nUse of hardware-specific features, such as the Android menu button\nUse of OS-specific controls, such as the Cocoa UI controls on iOS\nParticipation in the platform ecosystem, fo\nIn metallurgy, titanium gold (Ti-Au or Au-Ti) refers to an alloy consisting of titanium and gold. Such alloys are used in dentistry, ceramics and jewelry. Like many other alloys, titanium gold alloys have a higher yield strength, tensile strength, hardness, and magnetism than either of its constituent metals.\nIn July 2016, researchers led by Emilia Morosan at Rice University discovered that a titanium-gold alloy, \u03b2-Ti3Au, is an intermetallic alloy that is up to 4 times harder than pure titanium and most steels.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn the 2008 film Iron Man, the title character wears an armor made from a titanium-gold alloy. According to actor Robert Downey Jr., who played the role of Iron Man, the suit fit him \"like a gold-titanium glove\".\nIn the 2019 book The Secret Commonwealth (part of the universe of His Dark Materials trilogy), the alethiometer is revealed to be made primarily of a titanium-gold alloy.\nIn S6:E22 of The Blacklist the show\u2019s computer wizz, Aram Mojtabai, comments that the cage originally created to house Reddington is made of titanium gold alloy.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTitanium nitride, a gold-coloured, hard-wearing coating for steel\n\n\n== References ==\nThe Titanium Man is the name of two supervillains appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The original Titanium Man first appeared in Tales of Suspense #68 (September 1965) and was created by Stan Lee and Don Heck.\n\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\n\n\n=== Boris Bullski ===\nBoris Bullski was born in Makiivka, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union. According to the Black Widow, he was a KGB member when he was a young man, and she was his combat instructor for a time. An ambitious official of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Bullski was demoted after displeasing his superiors.\nWhile working as an administrator of a Siberian labor camp, he commissioned the imprisoned scientists at the camp to build a suit of armor using the lab of Anton Vanko, the creator of the original Crimson Dynamo armor. Seeking to win back the Party's favor, Bullski conceived the idea of winning a propaganda victory against the West by defeating the American superhero Iron Man. He assigned the scientists to create a powerful suit of titanium armor based on Iron Man's technology, though the inferior resources available to the scientists meant that the armor was twice the size of Iron Man's.  Bullski received permission to issue his challenge, and Iron Man accepted, defeating Titanium Man in a battle before a worldwide television audience.\nUndaunted, Bullski prepared for a rematch. The suit was redesigned, and he underwent medical treatments that increased his size and strength. Traveling to the US, Bullski fought Iron Man in the skies above Washington, D.C., but was defeated. Withdrawing for retrieval by a Soviet submarine, he discovered that he had been abandoned on orders from Moscow. \nBullski worked for the Vietnamese Communist scientist Half-Face (who increased his power yet again). Then, he returned to the service of the Government of the Soviet Union and was dispatched to the US to retrieve the third Crimson Dynamo, whom he found at Cord Industries. A three-way battle between Titanium Man, Crimson Dynamo, and Iron Man began, during which Titanium Man killed Janice Cord with an electronic beam. Enraged, Iron Man soundly defeated Titanium Man and left him in the murky depths of the Hudson River.\nAfter the defeat, the two disgraced Soviet agents fled to Communist-controlled Vietnam, where they joined with Radioactive Man to form the Titanic Three. Though Bullski enjoyed working as a sanctioned agent once again, he longed to return to the Soviet Union, and devised a new plan to win his superiors' favor. Adopting the alias The Other, he dispatched another former Soviet agent, Unicorn, to destroy Iron Man. When Unicorn failed, Titanium Man attempted to destroy Iron Man, but he failed again.\nDespite his failures, Bullski was in favor with the Soviet government, and he returned to the US on a mission for the KGB. By threatening the parents of a Soviet defector named Sergei, he forced the man to design technologically advanced armored suits that could be transformed into small card-like objects. Posing as \"the Commander\", Bullski used the suits to equip members of the Green Liberation Front (G.L.F.), an organization of disaffected Vietnam War veterans who felt ignored by their country. With the suits, the G.L.F. robbed a New York City bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; though the members believed that they were simply acting as thieves, Bullski used the robberies as a cover for implanting a computer virus that would destroy American financial records, causing chaos in the economy of the United States. Beta Ray Bill and Sif opposed the G.L.F. and the Commander, but when Sergei discovered that his parents were dead he exposed Bullski's true identity and the angry members of the G.L.F. turned on the Titanium Man. Teleporting away, he rematerialized in card form, which Sergei then simply tore and threw away.\nSometime later, the new Crimson Dynamo was sent to the US by the Soviet government to retrieve the remnants for reintegration\nThis is a list of countries by titanium sponge production based on USGS figures.

It has the appearance of black powder with the sodium chloride (face-centered cubic) crystal structure.\nIt occurs in nature as a form of the very rare mineral khamrabaevite (Russian: \u0425\u0430\u043c\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0442) - (Ti,V,Fe)C. It was discovered in 1984 on Mount Arashan in the Chatkal District, USSR (modern Kyrgyzstan), near the Uzbek border. The mineral was named after Ibragim Khamrabaevich Khamrabaev, director of Geology and Geophysics of Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Its crystals as found in nature range in size from 0.1 to 0.3 mm.\n\n\n== Physical properties ==\nTitanium carbide has an elastic modulus of approximately 400 GPa and a shear modulus of 188 GPa.\nTitanium carbide is soluble in solid titanium oxide, with a range of compositions which are collectively named \"titanium oxycarbide\" and created by carbothermic reduction of the oxide.\n\n\n== Manufacturing and machining ==\nTool bits without tungsten content can be made of titanium carbide in nickel-cobalt matrix cermet, enhancing the cutting speed, precision, and smoothness of the workpiece.\nThe resistance to wear, corrosion, and oxidation of a tungsten carbide\u2013cobalt material can be increased by adding 6\u201330% of titanium carbide to tungsten carbide. This forms a solid solution that is more brittle and susceptible to breakage.\nTitanium carbide can be etched with reactive-ion etching.\n\n\n== Applications ==\nTitanium carbide is used in preparation of cermets, which are frequently used to machine steel materials at high cutting speed.  It is also used as an abrasion-resistant surface coating on metal parts, such as tool bits and watch mechanisms. Titanium carbide is also used as a heat shield coating for atmospheric reentry of spacecraft.\n7075 aluminium alloy (AA7075) is almost as strong as steel, but weighs one third as much. Using thin AA7075 rods with TiC nanoparticles allows larger alloys pieces to be welded without phase-segregation induced cracks.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMetallocarbohedryne, a family of metal-carbon clusters including Ti8C12\n\n\n== References ==\nTitanium was first introduced into surgeries in the 1950s after having been used in dentistry for a decade prior. It is now the metal of choice for prosthetics, internal fixation, inner body devices, and instrumentation. Titanium is used from head to toe in biomedical implants. One can find titanium in neurosurgery, bone conduction hearing aids, false eye implants, spinal fusion cages, pacemakers, toe implants, and shoulder/elbow/hip/knee replacements along with many more. The main reason why titanium is often used in the body is due to titanium's biocompatibility and, with surface modifications, bioactive surface. The surface characteristics that affect biocompatibility are surface texture, steric hindrance, binding sites, and hydrophobicity (wetting). These characteristics are optimized to create an ideal cellular response. Some medical implants, as well as parts of surgical instruments are coated with titanium nitride (TiN).\n\n\n== Biocompatibility ==\nTitanium is considered the most biocompatible metal due to its resistance to corrosion from bodily fluids, bio-inertness, capacity for osseointegration, and high fatigue limit. Titanium's ability to withstand the harsh bodily environment is a result of the protective oxide film that forms naturally in the presence of oxygen. The oxide film is strongly adhered, insoluble, and chemically impermeable, preventing reactions between the metal and the surrounding environment.\n\n\n=== Osseointegration interaction and proliferation ===\n\n\n==== High energy surfaces induce angiogenesis during osseointegration ====\nIt has been suggested that titanium's capacity for osseointegration stems from the high dielectric constant of its surface oxide, which does not denature proteins (like tantalum, and cobalt alloys). Its ability to physically bond with bone gives titanium an advantage over other materials that require the use of an adhesive to remain attached. Titanium implants last longer and much higher forces are required to break the bonds that join them to the body compared to their alternatives.\n\n\n==== Surface properties determine osseointegration ====\nThe surface properties of a biomaterial play an important role in determining cellular response (cell adhesion and proliferation) to the material. Titanium's microstructure and high surface energy enable it to induce angiogenesis, which assists in the process of osseointegration.\n\n\n== Surface energy ==\n\n\n=== Redox potential ===\nTitanium can have many different standard electrode potentials depending on its oxidation state. Solid titanium has a standard electrode potential of -1.63V. Materials with a greater standard electrode potential are more easily reduced, making them better oxidizing agents. As can be seen in the table below, solid titanium prefers to undergo oxidation, making it a better reducing agent.\n\n\n=== Surface coating ===\n\nTitanium naturally passivates, forming an oxide film that becomes heterogeneous and polarized as a function of exposure time to bodily environments. This leads to the increased adsorption of hydroxyl groups, lipoproteins, and glycolipids over time. The adsorption of these compounds changes how the material interacts with the body and can improve biocompatibility. In titanium alloys such as Ti-Zr and Ti-Nb, zirconium and niobium ions that are liberated due to corrosion are not released into the patient's body, but rather added to the passivation layer. The alloying elements in the passive layer add a degree of biocompatibility and corrosion resistance depending on the original alloy composition of the bulk metal prior to corrosion.\nProtein surface concentration, (\n  \n    \n      \n        \u0393\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Gamma }\n  \n), is defined by the equation\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u0393\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                Q\n                \n                  ADS\n                \n              \n              M\n            \n            \n              n\n              F\n            \n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple Inc. Alongside the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, they form the eighteenth generation of the iPhone, succeeding the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, and were announced on September 9, 2024, and released on September 20, 2024. The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max include larger 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays, a faster processor, upgraded wide and ultra-wide cameras, support for Wi-Fi 7, larger batteries, and come pre-installed with the iOS 18 operating system.\n\n\n== Specifications ==\n\n\n=== Design and display ===\nThe iPhone 16 Pro models continue the edge-to-edge display design but introduce thinner display borders, giving them the thinnest borders of any Apple product to date; iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max feature larger 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch Super Retina XDR OLED displays, respectively, with iPhone 16 Pro Max offering the largest iPhone display ever. Both models have always-on 19.5:9 aspect ratio displays, with 460 ppi density from a 2622\u2009\u00d7\u20091206 (Pro) and 2868\u2009\u00d7\u20091320 (Pro Max) resolution. Both are 120 Hz, HDR10, with 1000 nits brightness typical and 2000 nits at peak.\nBoth Pro models come in four new colors, Desert Titanium, Natural Titanium, White Titanium and Black Titanium, offering a lightweight, scratch-resistant exterior. The Desert Titanium color replaced the Blue Titanium color used on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.\n\n\n=== Hardware ===\nThe iPhone 16 Pro models are powered by the Apple A18 Pro chip, built using a second-generation 3-nanometer process (TSMC N3E), significantly enhancing performance, especially in AI-related tasks. This chip includes a 6-core CPU, 6-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine with a speed of 35 trillion-operations-per-second that accelerates machine learning capabilities, allowing for seamless integration of Apple Intelligence features. Both models offer 8 GB of memory and storage options ranging from 128 GB (256 GB for Pro Max) to 1 TB.\nAll \u200ciPhone 16\u200c models have an improved thermal design. The main logic board has been updated, centralizing chip placement and optimizing the surrounding architecture. The \u200ciPhone 16 Pro\u200c lineup maximizes thermal capacity with a machined chassis that uses 100 percent recycled aluminum, bonded to the titanium frame using solid state diffusion. This is combined with a graphite clad aluminum substructure. The new thermal architecture enables a 20 percent improvement in sustained gaming performance compared to the A17 Pro.\nEvery model in the iPhone 16 lineup has support for Wi-Fi 7 (802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax/be). In a teardown by iFixit, the US model's modem was shown to be a Qualcomm SDX71M-000.\n\n\n=== Camera ===\nThe iPhone 16 Pro introduces an upgraded camera system, with three rear cameras and a lidar scanner. It features a \"wide\", \"ultrawide\" and \"telephoto\" lens. The wide camera is 48 megapixels, with sensor-shift optical image stabilization (OIS) and dual-pixel phase detection autofocus (PDAF). The ultrawide camera is 48 MP with a 120-degree field of view, optimized for low-light conditions. A 5\u00d7 optical zoom telephoto camera, which was previously exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro Max, now comes standard on both models. In addition, video recording now supports 4K at 120 frames per second, offering the iPhone's highest resolution and frame rate combination yet and is the only iPhone to record in 4k in slow motion. \n\n\n=== Camera control button ===\nAll iPhone 16 models now come with a new button called Camera Control. This button is on the right side of the device, and allows the user to open the camera app, switch between different camera controls and features, and taking photos and videos. The button can distinguish between light and hard presses. By pressing the button once, it opens the camera app. By lightly pressing it twice, it opens a small menu with different camera controls, such as zoom or tone, and if a user press it hard once, it takes a photo.

This alkoxide of titanium(IV) is used in organic synthesis and materials science. It is a diamagnetic tetrahedral molecule. Titanium isopropoxide is a component of the Sharpless epoxidation, a method for the synthesis of chiral epoxides.\nThe structures of the titanium alkoxides are often complex. Crystalline titanium methoxide is tetrameric with the molecular formula Ti4(OCH3)16. Alkoxides derived from bulkier alcohols such as isopropyl alcohol aggregate less. Titanium isopropoxide is mainly a monomer in nonpolar solvents.\n\n\n== Preparation ==\nIt is prepared by treating titanium tetrachloride with isopropanol in presence of ammonia.

Typically water is added in excess to a solution of the alkoxide in an alcohol.  The composition, crystallinity and morphology of the inorganic product are determined by the presence of additives (e.g. acetic acid), the amount of water (hydrolysis ratio), and reaction conditions.\nThe compound is also used as a catalyst in the preparation of certain cyclopropanes in the Kulinkovich reaction. Prochiral thioethers are oxidized enantioselectively using a catalyst derived from Ti(O-i-Pr)4.\n\n\n== Naming ==\nTitanium(IV) isopropoxide is a widely used item of commerce and has acquired many names in addition to those listed in the table. A sampling of the names include:\ntitanium(IV) i-propoxide, isopropyl titanate, tetraisopropyl titanate, tetraisopropyl orthotitanate, titanium tetraisopropylate, orthotitanic acid tetraisopropyl ester, Isopropyl titanate(IV), titanic acid tetraisopropyl ester, isopropyltitanate, titanium(IV) isopropoxide, titanium tetraisopropoxide, iso-propyl titanate, titanium tetraisopropanolate, tetraisopropoxytitanium(IV), tetraisopropanolatotitanium, tetrakis(isopropoxy) titanium, tetrakis(isopropanolato) titanium, titanic acid isopropyl ester, titanic acid tetraisopropyl ester, titanium isopropoxide, titanium isopropylate, tetrakis(1-methylethoxy)titanium.\n\n\n== Applications ==\nTTIP can be used as a precursor for ambient conditions vapour phase deposition such as infiltration into polymer thin films.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTitanium lactate is a chemical compound, a salt of titanium and lactic acid with the formula C12H20O12Ti.\n\n\n== Synthesis ==\nA reaction of lactic acid with tetraisopropyl titanate in distilled water.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nThe compound was used as a mordant in leather industry under the trade name of corrichrome.\n\n\n== References ==\nTitanium butoxide is a metal alkoxide with the formula Ti(OBu)4 (Bu = \u2013CH2CH2CH2CH3). It is a colorless odorless liquid although aged samples can appear yellowish.  Owing to hydrolysis, samples have a weak alcohol-like odor. It is soluble in many organic solvents. Decomposition in water is not hazardous, and therefore titanium butoxide is often used as a liquid source of titanium dioxide, which allows deposition of TiO2 coatings of various shapes and sizes down to the nanoscale.\nTitanium butoxide is often used to prepare titanium oxide materials and catalysts.\n\n\n== Structure and synthesis ==\n\nLike most titanium alkoxides (exception: titanium isopropoxide), Ti(OBu)4 is not a monomer but exists as a cluster (see titanium ethoxide).  Nonetheless it is often depicted as a simple monomer.\nIt is produced by treating titanium tetrachloride with butanol:\n\nTiCl4 +  4 HOBu \u2192  Ti(OBu)4  +  4 HCl\nThe reaction requires base to proceed to completion.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nLike other titanium alkoxides, titanium butoxide exchanges alkoxide groups:\n\nTi(OBu)4 +  HOR   \u2192    Ti(OBu)3(OR)  +  HOBu\nTi(OBu)3(OR) +  HOR   \u2192    Ti(OBu)2(OR)2  +  HOBu\netc.\nFor this reason, titanium butoxide is not compatible with alcohol solvents.\nAnalogous to the alkoxide exchange, titanium butoxide hydrolyzes readily.  The reaction details are complex, but the overall process can be summarized with this balanced equation.\n\nTi(OBu)4 +  2 H2O   \u2192    TiO2  +  4 HOBu\nDiverse oxo-alkoxo intermediates have been trapped and characterized.\nPyrolysis also affords the dioxide:\n\nTi(OBu)4  \u2192    TiO2  +  2 Bu2O\nTitanium butoxide reacts with alkylcyclosiloxanes. With ocatamethylcyclotetrasiloxane it produces dibutoxydimethylsilane, 1,5-dibutoxyhexamethyltrisiloxane, 1,7-dibutoxyoctamethyltetrasiloxane, 1,3-dibutoxytetramethyldisiloxane and polymers. With hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane it also produces dibutoxydimethylsilane.\n\n\n== Safety ==\nLD50 is 3122 mg/kg (rat, oral) and 180 mg/kg (mouse, intravenal).\nTitanium butoxide is a corrosive, flammable liquid which reacts violently with oxidizing materials. It is incompatible with sulfuric and nitric acids, inorganic hydroxides and peroxides, bases, amines, amides, isocyanates and boranes. It is irritating to skin and eyes, and causes nausea and vomiting if swallowed. LD50 is 3122 mg/kg (rat, oral) and 180 mg/kg (mouse, intravenal); flash point is 77 \u00b0C. \nWhen heated it emits irritating fumes, which form explosive mixtures with air at concentrations above 2 vol%.\n\n\n== References ==\nTi-6Al-4V (UNS designation R56400), also sometimes called TC4, Ti64, or ASTM Grade 5, is an alpha-beta titanium alloy with a high specific strength and excellent corrosion resistance. It is one of the most commonly used titanium alloys and is applied in a wide range of applications where low density and excellent corrosion resistance are necessary such as e.g. aerospace industry and biomechanical applications (implants and prostheses).\nStudies of titanium alloys used in armors began in the 1950s at the Watertown Arsenal, which later became a part of the Army Research Laboratory.\nA 1948 graduate of MIT, Stanley Abkowitz (1927-2017) was a pioneer in the titanium industry and is credited for the invention of the Ti-6Al-4V during his time at the US Army\u2019s Watertown Arsenal Laboratory in the early 1950s.\nTitanium/Aluminum/Vanadium alloy was hailed as a major breakthrough with strategic military significance. It is the most commercially successful titanium alloy and is still in use today, having shaped numerous industrial and commercial applications.\nIncreased use of titanium alloys as biomaterials is occurring due to their lower modulus, superior biocompatibility and enhanced corrosion resistance when compared to more conventional stainless steels and cobalt-based alloys. These attractive properties were a driving force for the early introduction of \u03b1 (cpTi) and \u03b1+\u03b2 (Ti\u20146Al\u20144V) alloys as well as for the more recent development of new Ti-alloy compositions and orthopaedic metastable b titanium alloys. The latter possess enhanced biocompatibility, reduced elastic modulus, and superior strain-controlled and notch fatigue resistance.  However, the poor shear strength and wear resistance of titanium alloys have nevertheless limited their biomedical use. Although the wear resistance of b-Ti alloys has shown some improvement when compared to a#b alloys, the ultimate utility of orthopaedic titanium alloys as wear components will require a more complete fundamental understanding of the wear mechanisms involved.\n\n\n== Chemistry ==\n(in wt. %) \n\n\n== Physical and mechanical properties ==\n\nTi-6Al-4V titanium alloy commonly exists in alpha, with hcp crystal structure, (SG : P63/mmc) and beta, with bcc crystal structure, (SG : Im-3m) phases. While mechanical properties are a function of the heat treatment condition of the alloy and can vary based upon properties, typical property ranges for well-processed Ti-6Al-4V are shown below. Aluminum stabilizes the alpha phase, while vanadium stabilizes the beta phase.\n\nTi-6Al-4V has a very low thermal conductivity at room temperature of 6.7 to 7.5 W/m\u00b7K, which contributes to its relatively poor machinability.\nThe alloy is vulnerable to cold dwell fatigue.\n\n\n== Heat treatment of Ti-6Al-4V ==\n\nTi-6Al-4V is heat treated to vary the amounts of and microstructure of \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha }\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b2\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\beta }\n  \n phases in the alloy. The microstructure will vary significantly depending on the exact heat treatment and method of processing. Three common heat treatment processes are mill annealing, duplex annealing, and solution treating and aging.\n\n\n== Applications ==\nAerospace structures. The Boeing 787 is 15% titanium by weight, and the Airbus A350 is 14%.\nBiomedical implants and prostheses\nHigh-performance race cars\nHigh-end bicycles\nAdditive manufacturing\nApple iPhone 15 Pro (Max) case, iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max cases and Apple Watch Series 10 titanium and Ultra 2 cases\nMarine applications: Ti-6Al-4V Grade 5 is extensively used in marine applications due to its exceptional corrosion resistance in seawater environments. Ti-6Al-4V is applied in components exposed to marine atmospheres and underwater conditions, such as shipbuilding, offshore oil and gas platforms, and subsea equipment. Its resistance to corrosion helps in reducing maintenance costs and extending the lifespan of marine equipment. \n\n\n== Specifications ==", "metadata": {"title": "Titanium", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium"}}
