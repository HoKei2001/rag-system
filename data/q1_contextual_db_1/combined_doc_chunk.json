        "content": "Charlotte Nicholls (née Brontë; 21 April 1816 – 31 March 1855), commonly known as Charlotte Brontë (, commonly ), was an English novelist and poet, the eldest of the three Brontë sisters who survived into adulthood and whose novels became classics of English literature. She is best known for her novel Jane Eyre, which she published under the male pseudonym Currer Bell. Jane Eyre went on to become a success in publication, and is widely held in high regard in the gothic fiction genre of literature.\nBrontë enrolled in school at Roe Head, Mirfield, in January 1831, aged 14 years. She left the year after to teach her sisters, Emily and Anne, at home, then returned to Roe Head in 1835 as a teacher. In 1839, she undertook the role of governess for the Sidgwick family, but left after a few months. The three sisters attempted to open a school in Haworth but failed to attract pupils. Instead, they turned to writing; they each first published in 1846 under the pseudonyms of Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. Although her first novel, The Professor, was rejected by publishers, her second novel, Jane Eyre, was published in 1847. The sisters admitted to their Bell pseudonyms in 1848, and by the following year were celebrated in London literary circles.\nBrontë was the last to die of all her siblings. She became pregnant shortly after her wedding in June 1854 but died on 31 March 1855, almost certainly from hyperemesis gravidarum, a complication of pregnancy which causes excessive nausea and vomiting.\n\n\n== Early years and education ==\nCharlotte Brontë was born on 21 April 1816 in Market Street, Thornton (in a house now known as the Brontë Birthplace), west of Bradford in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the third of the six children of Maria (née Branwell) and Patrick Brontë (formerly surnamed Brunty), an Irish Anglican clergyman. In 1820 her family moved a few miles to the village of Haworth, on the edge of the moors, where her father had been appointed perpetual curate of St Michael and All Angels Church. Maria died of cancer on 15 September 1821, leaving five daughters, Maria, Elizabeth, Charlotte, Emily and Anne, and a son, Branwell, to be taken care of by her sister, Elizabeth Branwell.\nIn August 1824, Patrick sent Charlotte, Emily, Maria, and Elizabeth to the Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge in Lancashire. Charlotte maintained that the school's poor conditions permanently affected her health and physical development, and hastened the deaths of Maria (born 1814) and Elizabeth (born 1815), who both died of tuberculosis in May (Maria) and June (Elizabeth) 1825. After the deaths of his older daughters, Patrick removed Charlotte and Emily from the school. Charlotte used the school as the basis for Lowood School in Jane Eyre, which is similarly affected by tuberculosis that is exacerbated by the poor conditions.\nAt home in Haworth Parsonage, Brontë acted as \"the motherly friend and guardian of her younger sisters\". Brontë wrote her first known poem at the age of 13 in 1829, and was to go on to write more than 200 poems in the course of her life. Many of her poems were \"published\" in their homemade magazine Branwell's Blackwood's Magazine, and concerned the fictional world of Glass Town. She and her surviving siblings – Branwell, Emily and Anne – created this shared  world, and began chronicling the lives and struggles of the inhabitants of their imaginary kingdom in 1827. Charlotte, in private letters, called Glass Town \"her 'world below', a private escape where she could act out her desires and multiple identities\". Charlotte's \"predilection for romantic settings, passionate relationships, and high society is at odds with Branwell's obsession with battles and politics and her young sisters' homely North Country realism, none the less at this stage there is still a sense of the writings as a family enterprise\".\nHowever, from 1831 onwards, Emily and Anne 'seceded' from the Glass Town Confederacy to create a 'spin-off' called Gondal, which in\nEmily Jane Brontë (, commonly ; 30 July 1818 – 19 December 1848) was an English novelist and poet who is best known for her only novel, Wuthering Heights, now considered a classic of English literature. She also published a book of poetry with her sisters Charlotte and Anne titled Poems by Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell with her own poems finding regard as poetic genius. Emily was the second-youngest of the four surviving Brontë siblings, between the youngest Anne and her brother Branwell. She published under the pen name Ellis Bell.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nEmily Brontë was born on 30 July 1818 to Maria Branwell and an Irish father, Patrick Brontë. The family was living on Market Street, in a house now known as the Brontë Birthplace in the village of Thornton on the outskirts of Bradford, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England.  Emily was the second youngest of six siblings, preceded by Maria, Elizabeth, Charlotte and Branwell.  In 1820, Emily's younger sister Anne, the last Brontë child, was born. Shortly thereafter, the family moved eight miles away to Haworth, where Patrick was employed as perpetual curate.  In Haworth, the children would have opportunities to develop their literary talents.\nWhen Emily was only three, and all six children under the age of eight, she and her siblings lost their mother, Maria, to cancer on 15 September 1821. The younger children were to be cared for by Elizabeth Branwell, their aunt and Maria's sister.\nEmily's three elder sisters, Maria, Elizabeth, and Charlotte were sent to the Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge. At the age of six, on 25 November 1824, Emily joined her sisters at school for a brief period. At school, however, the children suffered abuse and privations, and when a typhoid epidemic swept the school, Maria and Elizabeth became ill. Maria, who may actually have had tuberculosis, was sent home, where she died. Elizabeth died shortly after.\nThe four youngest Brontë children, all under ten years of age, had suffered the loss of the three eldest women in their immediate family.\nCharlotte maintained that the school's poor conditions permanently affected her health and physical development and that it had hastened the deaths of Maria (born 1814) and Elizabeth (born 1815), who both died in 1825. After the deaths of his older daughters, Patrick removed Charlotte and Emily from the school. Charlotte would use her experiences and knowledge of the school as the basis for Lowood School in Jane Eyre.\nThe three remaining sisters and their brother Branwell were thereafter educated at home by their father and aunt Elizabeth Branwell. A shy girl, Emily was very close to her siblings and was known as a great animal lover, especially for befriending stray dogs she found wandering around the countryside. Despite the lack of formal education, Emily and her siblings had access to a wide range of published material; favourites included Sir Walter Scott, Byron, Shelley, and Blackwood's Magazine.\n\nInspired by a box of toy soldiers Branwell had received as a gift, the children began to write stories, which they set in a number of invented imaginary worlds populated by their soldiers as well as their heroes, the Duke of Wellington and his sons, Charles and Arthur Wellesley. Little of Emily's work from this period survives, except for poems spoken by characters. Initially, all four children shared in creating stories about a world called Angria.\nHowever, when Emily was 13, she and Anne withdrew from participation in the Angria story and began a new one about Gondal, a fictional island whose myths and legends were to preoccupy the two sisters throughout their lives. With the exception of their Gondal poems and Anne's lists of Gondal's characters and placenames, Emily and Anne's Gondal writings were largely not preserved. Among those that did survive are some \"diary papers\", written by Emily in her twenties, which describe current events in Gondal. The heroes of Gondal tended to resemble the popular image \nThe Brontës () were a nineteenth-century literary family, born in the village of Thornton and later associated with the village of Haworth in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England. The sisters, Charlotte (1816–1855), Emily (1818–1848) and Anne (1820–1849), are well-known poets and novelists. Like many contemporary female writers, they published their poems and novels under male pseudonyms: Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. Their stories attracted attention for their passion and originality immediately following their publication. Charlotte's Jane Eyre was the first to know success, while Emily's Wuthering Heights, Anne's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall and other works were accepted as masterpieces of literature after their deaths.\nThe first Brontë children to be born to rector Patrick Brontë and his wife Maria were Maria (1814–1825) and Elizabeth (1815–1825), who both died at young ages due to disease. Charlotte, Emily and Anne were then born within a time period of approximately four years. These three sisters and their brother, Branwell (1817–1848), who had been born after Charlotte and before Emily, were very close to each other. As children, they developed their imaginations first through oral storytelling and play, set in an intricate imaginary world, and then through the collaborative writing of increasingly complex stories set in their fictional world. The deaths of their mother and two older sisters marked them and influenced their writing profoundly, as did their isolated upbringing. They were raised in a religious family. The Brontë birthplace in Thornton is a place of pilgrimage and their later home, the parsonage at Haworth in Yorkshire, now the Brontë Parsonage Museum, has hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.\n\n\n== Origin of the name ==\nThe Brontë family can be traced to the Irish clan Ó Pronntaigh, which literally means \"descendant of Pronntach\". They were a family of hereditary scribes and literary men in Fermanagh. The version Ó Proinntigh, which was first given by Patrick Woulfe in his Sloinnte Gaedheal is Gall (transl. Surnames of the Gael and the Foreigner) and reproduced without question by Edward MacLysaght, cannot be accepted as correct, as there were a number of well-known scribes with this name writing in Irish in the 17th and 18th centuries and all of them used the spelling Ó Pronntaigh. The name is derived from the word pronntach or bronntach, which is related to the word bronnadh, meaning \"giving\" or \"bestowal\" (pronn is given as an Ulster version of bronn in O'Reilly's Irish English Dictionary.) Patrick Woulfe suggested that it was derived from proinnteach (the refectory of a monastery). Ó Pronntaigh was earlier anglicised as Prunty and sometimes Brunty.\nAt some point, Patrick Brontë (born Brunty), the sisters' father, decided on the alternative spelling with the diaeresis over the terminal ⟨e⟩ to indicate that the name has two syllables. Multiple theories exist to account for the change, including that he may have wished to hide his humble origins. As a man of letters, he would have been familiar with classical Greek and may have chosen the name after the Greek βροντή (transl. thunder). One view, which biographer C. K. Shorter proposed in 1896, is that he adapted his name to associate himself with Admiral Horatio Nelson, who was also Duke of Bronte. One might also find evidence for this theory in Patrick Brontë's desire to associate himself with the Duke of Wellington in his form of dress.\n\n\n== Family tree ==\n\n\n== Members of the Brontë family ==\n\n\n=== Patrick Brontë ===\n\nPatrick Brontë (17 March 1777 – 7 June 1861), the Brontë sisters' father, was born in Loughbrickland, County Down, Ireland, of a family of farm workers of moderate means. His birth name was Patrick Prunty or Brunty. His mother, Alice McClory, was of the Roman Catholic faith, whilst his father Hugh was a Protestant, and Patrick was brought up in his father's faith.\n\nHe was a bright young man and, after studying under the Rev. Thomas\nAnne Brontë (, commonly ; 17 January 1820 – 28 May 1849) was an English novelist and poet, the youngest member of the Brontë literary family.\nAnne Brontë was the daughter of Maria (née Branwell) and Patrick Brontë, a poor Irish clergyman in the Church of England. Anne lived most of her life with her family at the parish of Haworth on the Yorkshire Dales. Otherwise, she attended a boarding school in Mirfield between 1836 and 1837, and between 1839 and 1845 lived elsewhere working as a governess. In 1846, she published a book of poems with her sisters and later two novels, initially under the pen name Acton Bell. Her first novel, Agnes Grey, was published in 1847 at the same time as Wuthering Heights by her sister Emily Brontë. Anne's second novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, was published in 1848. The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is often considered one of the first feminist novels.\nAnne died at 29, most likely of pulmonary tuberculosis. After her death, her sister Charlotte edited Agnes Grey to fix issues with its first edition, but prevented republication of The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. As a result, Anne is not as well known as her sisters. Nonetheless, both of her novels are considered classics of English literature.\n\n\n== Family background ==\n\nAnne's father was Patrick Brontë (1777–1861). Patrick Brontë was born in a two-room cottage in Emdale, Loughbrickland, County Down, Ireland. He was the oldest of ten children born to Hugh Brunty and Eleanor McCrory, poor Irish peasant farmers. The family surname, mac Aedh Ó Proinntigh, was Anglicised as Prunty or Brunty. Struggling against poverty, Patrick learned to read and write, and from 1798 taught others. In 1802, at 25, he won a place to study theology at St. John's College, Cambridge. Here he changed his name, Brunty, to the more distinguished sounding Brontë. In 1807, he was ordained in the priesthood in the Church of England. He served as a curate in Essex and then in Wellington, Shropshire. In 1810, he published his first poem, Winter Evening Thoughts, in a local newspaper. In 1811, he published a collection of moral verse, Cottage Poems. Also in 1811, he became vicar of St. Peter's Church in Hartshead, Yorkshire. In 1812, he was appointed an examiner in Classics at Woodhouse Grove School, near Bradford. This was a Wesleyan academy where, at 35, he met his future wife, the headmaster's niece, Maria Branwell.\nMaria Branwell (1783–1821), Anne's mother, was the daughter of Anne Carne, the daughter of a silversmith, and Thomas Branwell, a successful and property-owning grocer and tea merchant in Penzance. Maria was the eleventh of twelve children and enjoyed the benefits of a prosperous family in a small town. After the death of her parents, Maria went to help her aunt with housekeeping functions at the school. Maria was intelligent and well read, and her strong Methodist faith attracted Patrick Brontë, whose own leanings were similar.\nWithin three months, on 29 December 1812, though from considerably different backgrounds, Patrick Brontë and Maria Branwell were married. Their first child, Maria (1814–1825), was born after they moved to Hartshead. In 1815, Patrick was appointed curate of the chapel in Market Street Thornton, near Bradford. A second daughter, Elizabeth (1815–1825), was born shortly after. Four more children followed: Charlotte (1816–1855), Patrick Branwell (1817–1848), Emily (1818–1848), and Anne (1820–1849).\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAnne was the youngest of the Brontë children. She was born on 17 January 1820 at the parsonage in Market Street, Thornton (now known as the Brontë Birthplace), on the outskirts of Bradford. Her father, Patrick, was curate there. Anne was baptised there on 25 March 1820. Later Patrick was appointed to the perpetual curacy in Haworth, a small town seven miles (11 km) away. In April 1820 the family moved into the five-roomed Haworth Parsonage.\nWhen Anne was barely a year old her mother, Maria, became ill, probably with uterine cancer. Maria Branw\nPatrick Branwell Brontë (, commonly ; 26 June 1817 – 24 September 1848) was an English painter and writer. He was the only son of the Brontë family, and brother of the writers Charlotte, Emily, and Anne. Brontë was rigorously tutored at home by his father, and earned praise for his poetry and translations from the classics. However, he drifted between jobs, supporting himself by portrait-painting, and gave way to drug and alcohol addiction, apparently worsened by a failed relationship with a married woman. Brontë died at the age of 31.\n\n\n== Youth ==\n\nBranwell Brontë was the fourth of six children and the only son of Patrick Brontë (1777–1861) and his wife, Maria Branwell Brontë (1783–1821). He was born in a house (now known as the Brontë Birthplace) in Market Street, Thornton, near Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire, and moved with his family to Haworth when his father was appointed to the perpetual curacy in 1821.\nWhile four of his five sisters were sent to Cowan Bridge boarding school, Branwell was educated at home by his father, who gave him a classical education. Elizabeth Gaskell, biographer of his sister, Charlotte Brontë, says of Branwell's schooling \"Mr. Brontë's friends advised him to send his son to school; but, remembering both the strength of will of his own youth and his mode of employing it, he believed that Branwell was better at home, and that he himself could teach him well, as he had told others before.\" His two eldest sisters died just before his eighth birthday in 1825, and their loss affected him deeply.\nEven as a young boy Brontë read extensively, and was especially fond of the \"Noctes Ambrosianae\", literary dialogues published in Blackwood's Magazine. He took a leadership role with Charlotte in a series of fantasy role-playing games which the siblings wrote and performed about the \"Young Men\", characters based on a set of wooden soldiers. The plays evolved into an intricate saga based in West Africa about the fictitious Glass Town confederacy. From 1834, he both collaborated and competed with his sister Charlotte to describe another imaginary world, Angria. Branwell's particular interest in these paracosms were their politics and wars, including the destructive rivalry between their heroes, Charlotte's Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Zamorna, and his Alexander Percy, Earl of Northangerland. These writings impress by their virtuosity and scope, but are also repetitive when compared to Charlotte's contributions. Christine Alexander, a Brontë juvenilia historian at the University of New South Wales, wrote \"Both Charlotte and Branwell ensured the consistency of their imaginary world. When Branwell exuberantly kills off important characters in his manuscripts, Charlotte comes to the rescue and, in effect, resurrects them for the next stories [...]; and when Branwell becomes bored with his inventions, such as the Glass Town magazine he edits, Charlotte takes over his initiative and keeps the publication going for several more years. It was Branwell, however, who took a pride in systematizing their private world and maintaining a consistent political structure, features typical of paracosmic play. He documented in encyclopaedic detail, in neat lists, footnotes, sketches, and maps, the geography, history, government, and social structure of the Glass Town Federation (and later, the new kingdom of Angria)—laying down the parameters of the imaginary world\".: 6–7  He often wrote under several pseudonyms, such as Captain John Bud, Sergeant Bud, and Chief Genius Bany, who were also characters in their world.: 10–14 \nSurrounded by female company and missing that of males, there are signs of pleasure in his early works of the wider options he would have due to his sex.\nAged 11 in January 1829 he began producing a magazine, later named Branwell's Blackwood's Magazine which included his poems, plays, criticisms, histories, and dialogues.\nUnlike his sisters, Brontë was not prepared for a specific career. In his only real attemp\nThe Life of Charlotte Brontë is the posthumous biography of Charlotte Brontë by English author Elizabeth Gaskell. \nThe first edition was published in 1857 by Smith, Elder & Co. A major source was the hundreds of letters sent by Brontë to her lifelong friend Ellen Nussey.\nGaskell had to deal with rather sensitive issues, toning down some of her material: in the case of her description of the Clergy Daughters' School, attended by Charlotte and her sisters, this was to avoid legal action from the Rev. William Carus Wilson, the founder of the school. The published text does not go so far as to blame him for the deaths of two Brontë sisters, but even so the Carus Wilson family published a rebuttal with the title \"A refutation of the statements in 'The life of Charlotte Bronte,' regarding the Casterton Clergy Daughters' School, when at Cowan Bridge\".\nAlthough quite frank in many places, Gaskell suppressed details of Charlotte's love for Constantin Héger, a married man, on the grounds that it would be too great an affront to contemporary morals and a possible source of distress to Charlotte's living friends, father Patrick Brontë and husband. She also suppressed any reference to Charlotte's romance with George Smith, her publisher, who was also publishing the biography. In 2017, The Guardian named The Life of Charlotte Brontë one of the 100 best nonfiction books of all time.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nLane, Margaret.

He was the father of the writers Charlotte, Emily, and Anne Brontë, and of Branwell Brontë, his only son. Patrick outlived his wife, the former Maria Branwell, by forty years, by which time all of their six children had died as well.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nBrontë was born at Imdel (or Emdale) in the parish of Drumballyroney, County Down, the eldest of the ten children of Hugh Brunty, an Anglican, and Elinor Alice (née McClory), an Irish Catholic. His father was a \"farmhand, fence-fixer, and road-builder\". The family was \"large and very poor\", owning four books (including two copies of the Bible) and subsisting on \"porridge, potatoes, buttermilk and bread\" which \"gave Patrick a lifetime of indigestion\".\nHe had several apprenticeships (to a blacksmith, a linen draper, and a weaver) until he became a teacher in 1798. He moved to England in 1802, having won a scholarship to study theology as a sizar at St John's College, Cambridge, first registered as \"Branty\" or \"Brunty\", then \"Brontë\", receiving his AB degree in 1806. \nIn adult life, Patrick Brunty formally changed the spelling of his name to Brontë; while the reason for this change remains unclear, there are a number of prominent theories to explain it.\n\n\n== Curate ==\n\nHe was appointed curate at Wethersfield, near Braintree in Essex, where he was ordained a deacon of the Church of England in 1806, and then a parson in 1807.\nBrontë's first post as curate was at St Mary Magdalene Church, Wethersfield, Essex with the vicar being Joseph Jowett, Regius Professor of Law at Cambridge. Here in 1807 he met and fell in love with Mary Burder. After a disagreement and an undisclosed insult, with Burder's father's brother, her legal guardian, Mary was shipped out of town and Patrick decided it was best to take a new curacy. It was shortly after this period his first poetry was published.\nIn 1809, he became assistant curate at Wellington, Shropshire, and in 1810 his first published poem, the 256 line Winter Evening Thoughts, appeared in a local newspaper, followed in 1811 by a collection of moral verses, Cottage Poems. He moved to the West Riding of Yorkshire as a curate at All Saints, Dewsbury (now Dewsbury Minster) in December 1809. The area was undergoing an evangelical revival under the incumbent vicar John Buckworth. Brontë taught reading and writing at Dewsbury's Sunday School and was deputised by Buckworth to attend twice weekly meetings of the Church Mission Society on his behalf. A memorial plaque to Brontë can be found on the South Aisle of Dewsbury Minster.\nBuckworth appointed Brontë as an assistant curate to the Church of St Peter, Hartshead, a daughter church of Dewsbury in 1811. He served at Hartshead until 1815. In the meantime (1812) he was appointed a school examiner at a Wesleyan academy, Woodhouse Grove School, near Guiseley. In 1815 he moved again on becoming perpetual curate of Thornton.\n\n\n== Family ==\n\nAt Guiseley, Brontë met Maria Branwell (1783–1821), whom he married on 29 December 1812 in the Church of St. Oswald. They moved into a house on Halifax Road, Liversedge, where their first two children, Maria (1814–1825) and Elizabeth (1815–1825) were born. Their remaining children Charlotte (1816–1855), Patrick Branwell (1817–1848), Emily (1818–1848) and Anne (1820–1849) were born after they moved to Thornton.\nBrontë was offered the perpetual curacy of St Michael and All Angels' Church, Haworth in June 1819, and he took the family there in April 1820.  His sister-in-law Elizabeth Branwell (1776–1842), who had lived with the family at Thornton in 1815, joined the household in 1821 to help to look after the children and to care for Maria Brontë, who was ill, possibly suffering the final stages of what may have been uterine cancer or ovarian cancer. Elizabeth decided to move permanently to Haworth to act as houseke\nArthur Bell Nicholls (6 January 1819 – 2 December 1906) was the husband of the English novelist Charlotte Brontë. Between 1845 and 1861 Nicholls was one of Patrick Brontë's curates and was married to his eldest surviving child, Charlotte, for the last nine months of her life. He cared for Patrick Brontë after Charlotte Brontë's death and spent the rest of his life in the shadow of her reputation. He returned to his native Ireland, remarried and left the ministry.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nNicholls was one of ten children born to William Nicholls, a Presbyterian farmer and Margaret Bell Nicholls, a member of the Anglican Church of Ireland in Killead, County Antrim, in Ireland. He was educated at the Royal Free School in Banagher, County Offaly, whose headmaster was his uncle, Alan Bell. In 1836 Nicholls entered Trinity College Dublin, from where he graduated in 1844.\n\n\n== Curate at Haworth ==\nNicholls was ordained deacon in Lichfield in 1845 and became assistant curate to Patrick Brontë in June. Charlotte Brontë said of him that he appeared to be a respectable young man who read well, and she hoped that he would give satisfaction. Although he visited the poor of the parish practically every afternoon, he was considered to be strict and conventional, and in 1847 he carried out a campaign to prevent women from hanging their washing out to dry in the cemetery. Charlotte noted sadly that while he was away on holiday in Ireland many parishioners said that they hoped he would not return. He began to develop closer relations with Charlotte, who by that time had written  Jane Eyre, and they conducted a friendly exchange of letters. In December 1848, he conducted the funeral service of Emily Brontë.\n\n\n== Marriage to Charlotte Brontë ==\nOn 13 December 1852 Nicholls asked Charlotte for her hand in marriage. Charlotte's father vehemently refused to approve the union on the grounds that a poor Irish pastor should never be bold enough to suggest marrying his famous daughter. In 1853 Nicholls announced his intention to leave for Australia as a missionary, but he later changed his mind despite collecting references (including one from Patrick Brontë) and a farewell gift from the parishioners. He was re-deployed for several months to another parish, but he had several secret meetings with Charlotte in Haworth. Little by little Charlotte became persuaded by Nicholls, and in February 1854 her father finally gave his permission for the visits. Arthur Nicholls and Charlotte Brontë were married on 29 June 1854 in her father's church at Haworth. Patrick Brontë decided on the day of the ceremony not to attend, so Charlotte was led to the altar by Margaret Wooler, her former schoolmistress at Roe Head School. They honeymooned in Wales and Ireland before returning to live with Charlotte's father at Haworth Parsonage.\nFollowing Charlotte's sudden death, nine months later in 1855, Nicholls became the copyright holder of her works, making him an occasionally defensive and reluctant curator of her memory until the early twentieth century. Public interest in his wife, which began with the pseudonymously published Jane Eyre in 1847 and the public revelation of her true identity in 1850, rocketed in the months after the announcement of her death. As press speculation about Charlotte's private life became more intense and inaccurate Patrick Brontë requested the help of Charlotte's friend the novelist Elizabeth Gaskell to correct the distortions in the form of an authorised biography. Arthur Nicholls was reluctant to participate, especially as it would require him granting Gaskell permission to quote directly from Charlotte's personal letters. He relented but soon after the publication of The Life of Charlotte Brontë in 1857 he became embroiled in its controversies, writing furious letters to newspapers to defend Gaskell's depiction of Charlotte Brontë's miserable school days against the very teachers who now felt slandered. Further allegations of slander and libel le\nThe Brontë Parsonage Museum is a writer's house museum maintained by the Brontë Society in honour of the Brontë sisters – Charlotte, Emily and Anne. The museum is in the former Brontë family home, the parsonage in Haworth, West Yorkshire, England, where the sisters spent most of their lives and wrote their famous novels.\nThe Brontë Society, one of the oldest literary societies in the English speaking world, is a registered charity. Its members support the preservation of the museum and library collections.\nThe parsonage is listed Grade I on the National Heritage List for England.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe parsonage was built between 1778 and 1779. In 1820, Patrick Brontë was appointed incumbent of St Michael and All Angels' Church, Haworth, and arrived at the parsonage with his wife Maria and six children. It was the family home for the rest of their lives, and its moorland setting had a profound influence on the writing of Charlotte, Emily, and Anne. Patrick Brontë was a published author of poetry and fiction and his children grew up accustomed to the sight of books carrying their family name on the parsonage shelves.\n\nOn 15 September 1821, Maria Brontë died of cancer, and her unmarried sister, Elizabeth Branwell, came to run the household, exchanging her home in Penzance for the harsh climate of a bleak northern township. In 1824 the four oldest sisters left Haworth, to attend the Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge, near Kirkby Lonsdale. The eldest daughter, Maria, was sent home ill and died at the parsonage in May 1825, aged eleven. Ten-year-old Elizabeth was returned home shortly after and died on 15 June.\nIn 1846 Charlotte, Emily and Anne used part of their Aunt Branwell's legacy to finance the publication of their poems, concealing their true identities under the pseudonyms Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell. Poems was published by Aylott and Jones, but only two copies were sold. Charlotte's first attempt at writing a novel for publication, The Professor, was rejected by several publishing houses, before Smith, Elder & Co. declined to accept it but were encouraging enough for Charlotte to send them her next work, Jane Eyre. It was accepted and published on 19 October 1847. Wuthering Heights and Agnes Grey had been accepted by the London publisher, Thomas Cautley Newby and appeared as a three-volume set in December 1847. After Anne's second novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Charlotte and Anne were forced to reveal their true identities. Their brother, Branwell, who had become dependent on alcohol and opium for solace, had developed tuberculosis and died suddenly on Sunday 24 September 1848, aged 31. Emily was also dying from the disease, and never left the house after Branwell's funeral. She died aged 30 on 19 December 1848. Anne too had tuberculosis and was taken to Scarborough to try a sea cure but died four days after arriving on 28 May 1849, aged 29 years (Anne's gravestone mistakenly marks her age as 28 when she died).\nCharlotte finished the novel Shirley, begun before Branwell's death. It was published in October 1849. Her last novel, Villette, was published in 1853. She married her father's curate Arthur Bell Nicholls in Haworth Church on 29 June 1854. She died on 31 March 1855, in the early stages of pregnancy, at age 38. Patrick Brontë lived at the parsonage for six more years, cared for by his son-in-law, and died there on 7 June 1861, at the age of 84.\n\n\n== Brontë Society ==\nAfter Patrick Brontë's death in 1861 the contents of the parsonage were auctioned. Friends and servants sold keepsakes and letters. In 1893 the chief librarian of Bradford Library held a meeting suggesting that relics, letters and documents relating to the Brontës should be collected and preserved for posterity. The Brontë Society was founded at a public meeting and a collection of Brontëana was started. By 1895 it was large enough to be displayed in a museum above the Yorkshire Penny Bank in Haworth. The society attracted 260 members, and a\nEllen Nussey (20 April 1817 – 26 November 1897) was born in Birstall Smithies in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England. She was a lifelong friend, correspondent and potential lover of writer Charlotte Brontë and, through more than 500 letters received from her, was a major influence for Elizabeth Gaskell's 1857 biography The Life of Charlotte Brontë.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nNussey was the twelfth child of John Nussey (1760–1826), a cloth merchant of Birstall Smithies, near Gomersal in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and his wife Ellen, née Wade (c. 1771–1857). She attended a small local school before progressing to Gomersal Moravian Ladies Academy. Nussey met Mary Taylor and Charlotte Brontë in January 1831, when they were pupils at Roe Head School, near Mirfield in Yorkshire. They corresponded regularly over the next 24 years, each writing hundreds of letters to the other. In 1839, Nussey's brother, Henry, proposed marriage to Brontë, but she found him dull and refused his offer.\n\n\n== Friendship with the Brontës ==\nThrough her frequent visits to the Parsonage at Haworth, Nussey also became a friend of Anne and Emily Brontë, and was accepted as a suitable friend for his daughters by their father. In May 1849, Anne decided to visit Scarborough in the hope that the change of location and fresh sea air might be good for her failing health, and give her a chance to live. She went with Charlotte and Nussey. Before the trip, Anne expressed her frustration over unfulfilled ambitions in a letter to Ellen:\n\nI have no horror of death: if I thought it inevitable I think I could quietly resign myself to the prospect ... But I wish it would please God to spare me not only for Papa's and Charlotte's sakes, but because I long to do some good in the world before I leave it. I have many schemes in my head for future practise–humble and limited indeed–but still I should not like them all to come to nothing, and myself to have lived to so little purpose. But God's will be done.\n\nEn route, they spent a day and a night in York, where, escorting Anne around in a wheelchair, they did some shopping, and at Anne's request, visited York Minster. It became clear that Anne had little strength left and on Sunday, 27 May 1849, she asked Charlotte whether it would be easier for her to go home to die instead of remaining at Scarborough. A doctor, consulted the next day, indicated that death was already close. Anne received the news quietly. She expressed her love and concern for Nussey and Charlotte, and seeing Charlotte's distress, whispered to her to \"take courage\". Nussey's presence during the weeks following gave comfort to Charlotte Brontë, who was writing her novel Shirley at the time. Nussey believed that the character Caroline Helstone was based on herself. Nussey was staying with the Brontës at Haworth on the night of the 1851 census and is shown on the return as \"visitor\".\nWhen Charlotte Brontë married her father's curate, Arthur Bell Nicholls in June 1854, Nussey was one of two witnesses present. Their engagement had caused a cooling in the friendship on Nussey's part, who was probably jealous of Brontë's attachment to Nicholls, having thought they would remain spinsters. After Charlotte's death Nicholls became concerned that her letters to Nussey might damage her reputation and asked Nussey to destroy them, but she refused. Nussey sought to have the letters from Charlotte published until she learned that Nicholls held the copyright. After edited selections from more than 350 letters from Charlotte Brontë to Nussey were used in Gaskell's The Life of Charlotte Brontë, he prevented at least one other publication from using them.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\n\nAfter Charlotte's death in 1855 Nussey devoted the rest of her life to maintaining the memory of her friend, and was often sought out by Brontë enthusiasts and biographers.\nNussey experienced both health and financial issues in her final years and friends, including her cousin's wife, Agnes Nussey of Pott\nElizabeth Brontë (, commonly ; 8 February 1815 – 15 June 1825) was the second-eldest child of Patrick Brontë and Maria Brontë, née Branwell. A member of the literary Brontë family, Elizabeth was the younger sister of Maria Brontë as well as the elder sister of writers Charlotte, Emily and Anne, and poet and artist Branwell. Less is known about Elizabeth than any of the other members of her family.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nElizabeth Brontë was born on 8 February in 1815 and was named after her maternal aunt, as was customary at the time. She was only a few months old when she and her family, along with her aunt and namesake Elizabeth Branwell, moved from Hartshead to Thornton, where her baptism took place. Elizabeth was baptised on 26 August 1815 by J. Fennell, an officiating Minister at the Parish of Thornton and Chapelry of Thornton. Elizabeth's godmother was chosen to be Elizabeth Firth, one of the Brontës' new friends in Thornton. By 1820, Patrick and Maria Brontë had had four more children during their years in Thornton and they decided to move again to Haworth where Patrick would become a pastor at the Church of St Michael and All Angels and would live with his family at the adjoining parsonage.\n\n However, in 1821, Mrs. Brontë passed away – this led her sister, Elizabeth Branwell, to move into the Parsonage to look after the children. A servant of the Brontë family, Nancy Garrs, recalled how the young Elizabeth would lead her younger sisters by their hands on their walks across the Yorkshire moors, stating that she was ‘very thoughtful’ in her treatment of them. When Patrick Brontë asked Elizabeth what the best mode of education was for a woman, she responded “that which would make her rule the house well”.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 1823, Elizabeth and her elder sister Maria were sent to Crofton Hall, a fashionable boarding school in Yorkshire. However, the school's fees soon proved to be too high for Patrick, who also wished his three younger daughters to receive a formal education. Therefore, Maria and Elizabeth joined Cowan Bridge School, a newly opened boarding school for daughters of the clergy in Lancashire in July 1824 which was funded by, among others, William Wilberforce. The school would later be immortalised in fiction as Lowood School in Jane Eyre. The director and founder of Cowan Bridge, Reverend William Carus Wilson, was a clergyman who was said to have been looked up to by Patrick Brontë. Maria and Elizabeth were followed by Charlotte and Emily two months later. There was a distinct lack of sanitation in the school: the food provided by the school was often poorly cooked and unhealthy, and the cook was reported as being \"careless, dirty, and wasteful\". Both Maria and Elizabeth had recently recovered from measles and whooping cough, and they often could not eat despite the fact that they were hungry.\n\nElizabeth was not generally described as academic and instead was described as a practical girl with 'sound common sense' by her father; while school records showed that Maria, Charlotte and Emily were to be trained to be governesses, Elizabeth's future occupation was listed as a 'housekeeper'. Perhaps owing to this, Patrick did not pay an extra £3 a year so that Elizabeth might learn French, music and drawing, as he did with his other three daughters.\n\n\n== Illness and death ==\n \nIn February 1825, Maria was diagnosed with tuberculosis and was transported back home. Possibly encouraged by bad conditions, in the early spring of that same year there was an outbreak of typhus in the school. There is a possibility that this may have covered up symptoms of tuberculosis in Elizabeth. Over the following six months one girl was to die at school and 20 more were withdrawn ill with six dying soon afterwards. Elizabeth was sent home ill on 31 May, by which time Maria had already died. A few days later, Charlotte and Emily were brought home in good health and none of the family were ever to return to Cowan Bridge School. Elizabeth d\nWuthering Heights is the only novel by the English author Emily Brontë, initially published in 1847 under her pen name \"Ellis Bell\". It concerns two families of the landed gentry living on the West Yorkshire moors, the Earnshaws and the Lintons, and their turbulent relationships with the Earnshaws' foster son, Heathcliff. The novel, influenced by Romanticism and Gothic fiction, is considered a classic of English literature.\nWuthering Heights was accepted by publisher Thomas Newby along with Anne Brontë's Agnes Grey before the success of their sister Charlotte Brontë's novel Jane Eyre, but they were published later. After Emily's death, Charlotte edited a second edition of Wuthering Heights, which was published in 1850. \nWuthering Heights is now widely considered to be one of the greatest novels ever written in English, but contemporaneous reviews were polarised. It was controversial for its depictions of mental and physical cruelty, including domestic abuse, and for its challenges to Victorian morality, religion, and the class system. It has inspired an array of adaptations across several media, including English singer-songwriter Kate Bush's song of the same name.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\n\n=== Opening ===\nIn 1801, Mr Lockwood, the new tenant at Thrushcross Grange in Yorkshire, pays a visit to his landlord, Heathcliff, at his remote moorland farmhouse, Wuthering Heights. There he meets a reserved young woman (later identified as Cathy Linton), Joseph, a cantankerous servant, and Hareton, an uneducated young man who speaks like a servant. Everyone is sullen and inhospitable. Snowed in for the night, Lockwood reads the diary of the former inhabitant of his room, Catherine Earnshaw, and has a nightmare in which a ghostly Catherine begs to enter through the window. Awakened by Lockwood's fearful yells, Heathcliff is troubled.\nLockwood later returns to Thrushcross Grange in heavy snow, falls ill from the cold and becomes bedridden. While he recovers, Lockwood's housekeeper Ellen \"Nelly\" Dean tells him the story of the strange family.\n\n\n=== Nelly's tale ===\nThirty years earlier, the Earnshaws live at Wuthering Heights with their two children, Hindley and Catherine, and a servant—Nelly herself. Returning from a trip to Liverpool, Earnshaw brings home an orphan whom he names Heathcliff. Heathcliff's origins are unclear but it's suggested he is either of Romani or Lascar descent. Earnshaw treats the boy as his favourite. His own children he neglects, especially after his wife dies. Hindley beats Heathcliff, who gradually becomes close friends with Catherine.\nHindley departs for university, returning as the new master of Wuthering Heights on the death of his father three years later. He and his new wife Frances force Heathcliff to live as one of their servants and subject him to much verbal and emotional abuse.\n\nEdgar Linton and his sister Isabella live nearby at Thrushcross Grange. Heathcliff and Catherine spy on them out of curiosity. When Catherine is attacked by their dog, the Lintons take her in, but send Heathcliff home. The Lintons visit, and Hindley and Edgar make fun of Heathcliff; a fight ensues. Heathcliff is then made to live in the manor's unheated, dusty attic and swears that he will one day have his revenge.\nFrances dies after giving birth to a son, Hareton. Two years later, Catherine becomes engaged to Edgar. She confesses to Nelly that she loves Heathcliff, and will try to help him, but feels she cannot marry him because of his low social status. Nelly warns her against associating with a man like Heathcliff. Heathcliff overhears part of the conversation and, misunderstanding Catherine's heart, flees the household. Catherine falls ill, distraught.\nThree years after his departure, with Edgar and Catherine now wed and expecting children, Heathcliff unexpectedly returns, now a wealthy gentleman. He encourages Isabella's infatuation with him as a means of revenge on Catherine. Enraged by Heathcliff's constant presence at Thrushcross G\nMaria Brontë (, commonly ; 23 April 1814 – 6 May 1825) was the eldest daughter of Patrick Brontë and Maria Brontë, née Branwell.\nShe was the elder sister of Elizabeth Brontë, the writers Charlotte, Emily, and Anne Brontë, and the painter and poet Branwell. She was born in Hartshead, Yorkshire, and died at the age of 11.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nAt the age of six, Maria was characterised as \"grave, thoughtful, and quiet, to a degree far beyond her years\". After their mother's death in 1821, Maria and her sisters became withdrawn, preferring to only be in each other's company. Maria often read the many newspapers brought home by their father and relayed their contents to her younger sisters.\nMaria was said to have been a precocious child; asked at the age of 10 \"what...the best mode of spending time [was]\" by her father, she answered, \"by laying it out in preparation for a happy eternity.\" Patrick later said that he could speak with Maria on any popular or current topics as freely and amply as with an adult, mournfully recalling her \"powerfully intellectual mind\". A printer from Thornton, West Yorkshire, where the family had moved in 1815, noted that Patrick once entrusted the reviewing of one of his galley proofs to Maria. Charlotte would later describe her older sister as being rather serious and silent, and Elizabeth Gaskell, Charlotte's friend and, later, biographer, described Maria as \"delicate, unusually clever and thoughtful for her age, gentle, and untidy\". In 1820, her father moved the family to Haworth.\nIn 1823, 9-year-old Maria and 8-year-old Elizabeth were sent to Crofton Hall, a fashionable Yorkshire boarding school. The fees, however, proved to be too high for Patrick, who also had three younger daughters in need of a good education. So, in July 1824, Maria and Elizabeth joined Cowan Bridge School, a newly opened boarding school for daughters of the clergy in Lancashire, with Charlotte and Emily following two months later. The food provided by the school was generally poorly cooked and unhealthy, and the cook was reported to be \"careless, dirty, and wasteful\". Both Maria and Elizabeth had just recovered from measles and whooping cough, and, despite being hungry, they often could not eat. In the school register, Maria is summarily described as such:\n\nMaria Brontë, aged 10 ... reads tolerably. Writes pretty well. Ciphers a little. Works badly. Very little of geography or history. Has made some progress in reading French, but knows nothing of the language grammatically.\nMs. Andrews, a teacher at Cowan Bridge, described Maria as \"a girl of fine imagination and extra-ordinary talents\". School records show that, as Maria, Charlotte, and Emily were being trained to become governesses, Patrick paid an extra £3 for each girl for them to be taught French, music and drawing.\n\n\n== Death ==\nIn spring 1825, a typhoid epidemic swept through the school, causing the departure of almost a sixth of the students between February and June. By the winter of 1824, Maria's health was rapidly deteriorating and, after she was diagnosed with tuberculosis in February 1825, she was swiftly returned home. She lived at the parsonage in Haworth for three months, alongside her father, brother Branwell, and youngest sister Anne, who had not yet been sent to school, until she eventually succumbed to her illness on May 6, shortly after her 11th birthday. Meanwhile, Elizabeth, whose health had also been declining, was likewise diagnosed with tuberculosis. She, too, was removed from school, arriving in Haworth three weeks after Maria's death.\nElizabeth would die only six weeks later. In the wake of their sisters' deaths, Charlotte and Emily were withdrawn from Cowan Bridge, and never sent back to school; Anne, for one, was never sent to school in the first place after the tragedy, being educated at home, mostly by her father and aunt. Patrick would later connect Maria's death to a higher meaning, writing that \"she exhibited during her illness m\nJane Eyre ( AIR; originally published as Jane Eyre: An Autobiography) is a novel by the English writer Charlotte Brontë. It was published under her pen name \"Currer Bell\" on 19 October 1847 by Smith, Elder & Co. of London. The first American edition was published the following year by Harper & Brothers of New York. Jane Eyre is a bildungsroman that follows the experiences of its eponymous heroine, including her growth to adulthood and her love for Mr Rochester, the brooding master of Thornfield Hall.\nThe novel revolutionised prose fiction, being the first to focus on the moral and spiritual development of its protagonist through an intimate first-person narrative, where actions and events are coloured by a psychological intensity. Charlotte Brontë has been called the \"first historian of the private consciousness\" and the literary ancestor of writers such as Marcel Proust and James Joyce.\nThe book contains elements of social criticism with a strong sense of Christian morality at its core, and it is considered by many to be ahead of its time because of Jane's individualistic character and how the novel approaches the topics of class, sexuality, religion and feminism. Jane Eyre, along with Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, is one of the most famous romance novels. It is considered one of the greatest novels in the English language, and in 2003 was ranked as the tenth best-loved book in Britain by the BBC in The Big Read poll.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nJane Eyre is divided into 38 chapters. It was originally published in three volumes in the 19th century, consisting of chapters 1 to 15, 16 to 27, and 28 to 38.\nThe second edition was dedicated to William Makepeace Thackeray.\nThe novel is a first-person narrative from the perspective of the title character. Its setting is somewhere in the north of England, late in the reign of George III (1760–1820). It has five distinct stages: Jane's childhood at Gateshead Hall, where she is emotionally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins; her education at Lowood School, where she gains friends and role models but suffers privations and oppression; her time as governess at Thornfield Hall, where she falls in love with her mysterious employer, Edward Fairfax Rochester; her time in the Moor House, during which her earnest but cold clergyman cousin, St John Rivers, proposes to her; and ultimately her reunion with, and marriage to, her beloved Rochester. Throughout these sections it provides perspectives on a number of important social issues and ideas, many of which are critical of the status quo.\nThe five stages of Jane's life are as follows:\n\n\n=== Gateshead Hall ===\n\nJane Eyre, aged 10, lives at Gateshead Hall with her maternal uncle's family, the Reeds, as a result of her uncle's dying wish. Jane was orphaned several years earlier when her parents died of typhus. Jane's uncle, Mr Reed, was the only one in the Reed family who was kind to Jane. Jane's aunt, Sarah Reed, dislikes her and treats her as a burden. Mrs Reed also discourages her three children from associating with Jane. As a result Jane becomes defensive against her cruel judgement. The nursemaid, Bessie, proves to be Jane's only ally in the household, even though Bessie occasionally scolds Jane harshly. Excluded from the family activities, Jane lives an unhappy childhood.\nOne day, as punishment for defending herself against the bullying of her 14-year-old cousin John, the Reeds' only son, Jane is locked in the red room in which her late uncle had died; there she faints from panic after she thinks she has seen his ghost. The red room is significant because it lays the grounds for the \"ambiguous relationship between parents and children\" which plays out in all of Jane's future relationships with male figures throughout the novel. She is subsequently attended to by the kindly apothecary, Mr Lloyd, to whom Jane reveals how unhappy she is living at Gateshead Hall. He recommends to Mrs Reed that Jane should be sent to school, an idea Mrs Reed ha\nLaura Joh Rowland (born 1953) is an American detective/mystery author best known for her series of historical mystery novels featuring protagonist  Sano Ichirō (佐野 一郎) set in feudal Japan, mostly in Edo during the late 17th century. She is also the author of two other historical  mystery series, one featuring a fictionalized Charlotte Brontë, as well an ongoing series set in Victorian England around the time of the Jack the Ripper murders.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nLaura Joh Rowland is the granddaughter of Chinese American and Korean American immigrants. She grew up in Harper Woods, Michigan and was educated at the University of Michigan, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Microbiology and a Master of Public Health. She tried a number of careers after college, including chemist, microbiologist, quality engineer with Lockheed Martin, and freelance illustrator, but it wasn't until she took a writing course that she found her calling.\n\n\n== Writer ==\n\n\n=== Sano Ichirō ===\nUsing as her inspiration P.D. James and Elizabeth George, Rowland set out to write a mystery novel. She had been a big fan of samurai films during her university days, and decided  to set her first novel in feudal Japan because \"I needed to carve out a territory for myself, and feudal Japan was wide open. It was a marriage of interest and opportunity.\" Rowland wrote two novels, which were rejected for publication. After finishing her third novel, she sent the manuscript to two publishers and presented a copy to a Random House editor whom she had met at a writer's conference. When all three publishers expressed interest, there was a bidding war that Random House won for $100,000. Shinjū was subsequently published by Random House in 1994. Her feudal Japan series, which eventually reached 16 titles, deals with the experiences of Sano Ichirō, a samurai and minor official who, by the end of the first novel, becomes the trusted chief investigator for the fifth Tokugawa shōgun, Tokugawa Tsunayoshi, and by the tenth novel, is promoted to a very high office.\nThroughout the stories, Sano constantly has to deal with the moral conflict of following the code of bushido while serving both justice and his master, the Shogun. After his arranged marriage at the start of the fourth novel to Ueda Reiko (上田 麗子), he also has to deal with her non-traditional attitude as she frequently involves herself in Sano's investigations. In all the novels, Sano experiences great pressure as he is faced with death if he does not fulfill his obligations to the shōgun as well.\nRowland takes some literary license with known figures, creating fictionalized versions of Tokugawa Tsunayoshi, Emperor Higashiyama in The Samurai's Wife, and Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu. Objective historical details, however, are credibly accurate, although New York Times critic F.G. Notehelfer pointed out several historical anachronisms in the first book of the series, Shinjū.\n\n\n=== Charlotte Brontë ===\nIn 2008, Rowland started a different mystery series, one that used Charlotte Brontë as the protagonist. When asked about the difficulty of focusing on such a famous historical figure, she replied, \"Writing about famous people can mean challenging readers’ assumptions about them. I think a lot of readers see Charlotte Bronte as a prim church mouse who never left Haworth and never did anything but write.\"\n\n\n=== A Victorian Mystery ===\nIn 2017, Rowland branched out again, this time setting a series of novels in Victorian England during the Jack the Ripper murders. The protagonist of the series is a fictional photographer named Sarah Bain. According to Rowland, Bain has \"inside information about the Ripper murders and personal reasons for keeping it secret.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nLaura Picker, writing for Publishers Weekly, noted, \"As with all successful historicals, Rowland's Sano novels blend painstaking research with characters whose personalities and inner struggles engage the reader. Sustaining that combination over 16 books i\nMaria Branwell (15 April 1783 – 15 September 1821) is best known as being the mother of British writers Emily Brontë, Anne Brontë, Charlotte Brontë and of their brother Branwell Brontë, who was a poet and painter. Maria married Patrick Brontë on 29 December 1812.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nMaria Branwell was the eighth child of 12 born to Anne Carne and Thomas Branwell in Penzance, Cornwall, although only five daughters and one son grew to adulthood. Thomas Branwell was a successful merchant and owned many properties throughout the town. The men of the Branwell family took part in the town's public life. Maria's brother Benjamin was mayor in 1809. \nThe family were prominent Methodists. Thomas' sister and two of his daughters married clergymen of Wesleyan leanings: his sister Jane married John Fennell in 1790; his daughter Jane Branwell married John Kingston in 1800; and Maria married Patrick Brontë in 1812. The first Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built in Penzance in 1814, and the Branwells were instrumental in having this built.\n\n\n== Courtship and marriage ==\nMaria met Patrick Brontë in 1812 when visiting her aunt Jane (her father's sister) and uncle John Fennell in Yorkshire after four family deaths between 1808 and 1812, including both of her parents. Maria moved to Yorkshire to help her aunt with the household management of a new Methodist training school. John Fennell, a former schoolmaster and Methodist class leader in Penzance and Wellington, Shropshire, was appointed headmaster of the newly opened Woodhouse Grove School at Rawdon, for the sons of Methodist ministers in 1812. Patrick, during his curacy in Wellington, had known John Fennell in Shropshire's Wesleyan circles.\nWhen Fennell was invited to the Yorkshire headship, he needed external examiners for his students and invited Patrick to serve in that capacity at Woodhouse Grove. Maria and Patrick 'loved at first sight' and married within the year. They were married on 29 December 1812 at Guiseley Parish Church by mutual friend Reverend William Morgan, who, on the same day, married Jane and John Fennell's daughter, Jane Branwell Fennell. \n\nBefitting the close family that the Branwells were, also married on that day at the same hour were Maria's youngest sister, Charlotte, to her cousin Joseph Branwell at the parish church of Madron in Cornwall.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nMaria and Patrick's first home was Clough House in Hightown. Their first two children, Maria and Elizabeth, were born there in 1813/1814 and 1815. Their second home was in Thornton, where their remaining children were born: \n\nCharlotte (1816)\nPatrick Branwell (1817)\nEmily Jane (1818)\nAnne (1820)\nIn 1820 the Brontës moved to Haworth. After moving to Haworth, Maria sickened with what may have been uterine or ovarian cancer, or chronic pelvic sepsis and anaemia brought on by the birth of her youngest daughter Anne. Whatever the cause, Maria died seven and half months later, suffering a long agony; Anne was only twenty months old. \nMaria was buried on 22 September 1821 at Haworth. William Morgan performed the burial ceremony.\n\n\n== Works ==\nThe only work besides letters that Maria wrote was the essay \"The Advantages of Poverty, In Religious Concerns.\" The essay can be found in the book Life and Letters by Clement Shorter.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBrontë family\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBackground and Early Life of Maria Branwell at Victorian Era England & Life Of Victorians\nMaria Branwell - Mother of the Brontë sisters at The Cornwall Guide\nBrontë Country is a name given to an area of south Pennine hills west of Bradford in West Yorkshire, England. The name comes from the Brontë sisters, who wrote such literary classics as Jane Eyre (Charlotte Brontë), Wuthering Heights (Emily Brontë), and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (Anne Brontë) while living in the area.\n\n\n== Geology ==\nThe geology of the Brontë country is mainly gritstone.\n\n\n== Points of interest ==\nThe area includes the village of Haworth, where the Brontë sisters lived, and where the Brontë Parsonage Museum is located today. Top Withens is said to have been the inspiration for Wuthering Heights. Ponden Hall, which located about half a mile outside Stanbury, is believed to inspire at least two buildings in Brontës' novels: Thrushcross Grange in Wuthering Heights and the eponymous mansion in The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. Thornton, on the outskirts of Bradford, is the birthplace of the Brontë sisters and their brother Branwell (their father was rector of Thornton church). The house where they were born still exists as the Brontë Birthplace and in November 2023 was acquired for restoration and preservation as a cultural and educational space. It is located on Market Street in the centre of the village.\nOther places of interest from the Brontë sisters' novels include Oakwell Hall (Fieldhead in Shirley), Red House (Briarmains in Shirley), and Gawthorpe Hall and Wycoller Hall (Ferndean Manor in Jane Eyre).\n\n\n== In media and culture ==\nThe film Brontë Country: The Story of the Emily, Charlotte & Anne Brontë discusses the area's geography and history, and the history of the Brontë family.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nBronte Country\nTourist Information website for the Brontë Country Archived 16 July 2005 at the Wayback Machine\nTourist information website for Haworth Archived 6 November 2016 at the Wayback Machine\nWeb news magazine from the Brontë Parsonage Museum\nWebsite of the Brontë Parsonage Museum in Haworth\nThe Cowan  Bridge School was a Clergy Daughters' School, founded in the 1820s, at Cowan Bridge in the English county of Lancashire. It was mainly for the daughters of middle class clergy and attended by the Brontë sisters. In the 1830s it moved to Casterton, Cumbria, a few miles away.\n\n\n== History ==\nCowan Bridge School was a Clergy Daughters' School, founded and purchased in 1824 by Mr. Carus- Wilson. The old part of the school consisted of one house which housed the teachers. He added a building for a school and student dormitories. It was a school mainly for the daughters of middle class clergy. It was first located in the village of Cowan Bridge in Lancashire, where it was attended by the Brontë sisters.  Two of the sisters, Maria and Elizabeth died from tuberculosis in the aftermath of a typhoid outbreak at the school. \nIn the 1830s the school moved to Casterton, a few miles away, where it was amalgamated with another girls' school. The (later headmistress) Dorothy Wilkinson travelled from Tasmania as a girl to attend in 1896. The institution survived to the twenty-first century as Casterton School.\nThe building, now called the Brontë School House, is presently used as self-catering accommodation for tourists to the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales.\n\n\n== Conditions ==\nThe Cowan Bridge school imposed a uniform on the children known as the Charity children, which humiliated the Brontës, who were among the youngest of the boarders. They suffered taunting from the older children,  Charlotte Brontë especially, who owing to her short sightedness had to hold her nose close to the paper to be able to read or write. They  slept two in a bed with their heads propped up, rising  before dawn, making their morning ablutions in a basin of cold water (shared with six other pupils) which had often frozen during the night for lack of any heating. They descended for an hour and a half of prayers before breakfasting on porridge, frequently burnt.\n\n\n== Charlotte Brontë's description ==\n\nCharlotte Brontë's description in her 1847 novel Jane Eyre was similar, with burnt porridge and frozen water. They began their lessons at half past nine, ending at noon, followed by recreation in the garden until dinner, a meal taken very early. Lessons began again without pause until 5 p.m., when there was a short break for half a slice of bread and a small bowl of coffee and 30 minutes recreation, followed by another long period of study. The day ended with a glass of water, an oatcake, and evening prayers before bed. Punishments included privation of food and recreation, corporal punishment, and humiliations such as being made to sit on a stool for hours on end without moving, wearing a dunce's cap.\nThe punishment is described in Jane Eyre and reports by Mrs Gaskell confirm this ill-treatment. Furthermore, when Mr Williams, reader at Smith, Elder & Co, congratulated her for the narrative vigour of her description, Charlotte Brontë, unusually vehemently, insisted that it was true, and that furthermore she had deliberately avoided telling everything so as not to be accused of exaggeration. It is difficult to think that Charlotte Brontë, having  persistently repeated for twenty  years the stories about the bad treatment inflicted on her sisters, could have exaggerated or invented them. For example, there is the description, given by an unidentified witness to Mrs  Gaskell, of the little Maria who, very ill and having just received a suction cup placed on her right side by the doctor, rose suddenly on seeing Miss Andrews enter the room, and began to get dressed. Before she could slip into some clothing, the mistress pulled her violently into the centre of the room, scolding her for negligence and disorder, and punished her for being late, upon which Maria descended from the dormitory although she could hardly stand up. According to Mrs Gaskell, the witness spoke as if she saw it yet, and her whole face flashed out undying indignation.\nThe hardest days were Su\nEmma is the title of a manuscript by Charlotte Brontë, left incomplete when she died in 1855.\nA pastiche of it was written by Clare Boylan and published as Emma Brown in 2003.\n\n\n== Original manuscript ==\nBrontë began work on Emma in 1853. Her marriage in 1854 and the lukewarm enthusiasm of her husband for the project may have contributed to her slow progress towards completion. The manuscript was left unfinished at her death in 1855.\nThe original twenty-page manuscript consists of two chapters describing the arrival of an apparently wealthy young girl, \"Matilda Fitzgibbon\", at an expensive private school. It transpires that her identity is fake, and that her school fees will not be paid. The child is unable to answer any questions as to her true identity.\n\n\n== Savery's completion ==\nConstance Savery published a completion in 1980.\n\n\n== Boylan's completion ==\nBoylan \"steeped herself in letters and writings\" and acknowledged the assistance of several notable Brontë scholars in her afterword to the novel.\nBoylan developed the story as a mystery novel, using two characters from Brontë's original chapters who work together to solve the puzzle of the eponymous girl's identity: Mrs. Chalfont, a widow introduced as a narrator in the manuscript, and Mr. Ellin, a lawyer who accepts the challenge the girl represents.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nBoylan's version was favourably reviewed but was not regarded as a faithful continuation of the style and voice of Brontë. Boylan's Telegraph obituary concluded that she \"conveyed little of the deep moral and theological framework that underpinned Charlotte Brontë's writing.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Emma: A Fragment of a Story public domain audiobook at LibriVox\nElizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell (née Stevenson; 29 September 1810 – 12 November 1865), often referred to as Mrs Gaskell, was an English novelist, biographer, and short story writer. Her novels offer a detailed portrait of the lives of many strata of Victorian society, including the very poor. Her first novel, Mary Barton, was published in 1848. Gaskell's The Life of Charlotte Brontë, published in 1857, was the first biography of Charlotte Brontë. In this biography, she wrote only of the moral, sophisticated things in Brontë's life; the rest she omitted, deciding certain, more salacious aspects were better kept hidden. Among Gaskell's best known novels are Cranford (1851–1853), North and South (1854–1855), and Wives and Daughters (1864–1866), all of which were adapted for television by the BBC.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nGaskell was born Elizabeth Cleghorn Stevenson on 29 September 1810 in Lindsey Row, Chelsea, London, now 93 Cheyne Walk. The doctor who delivered her was Anthony Todd Thomson, whose sister Catherine later became Gaskell's stepmother. She was the youngest of eight children; only she and her brother John survived infancy. Her father, William Stevenson, a Unitarian from Berwick-upon-Tweed, was minister at Failsworth, Lancashire, but resigned his orders on conscientious grounds. He moved to London in 1806 on the understanding that he would be appointed private secretary to James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale, who was to become Governor General of India.  That position did not materialise, however, and Stevenson was nominated Keeper of the Treasury Records.\nHis wife, Elizabeth Holland, came from a family established in Lancashire and Cheshire that was connected with other prominent Unitarian families, including the Wedgwoods, the Martineaus, the Turners and the Darwins. When she died 13 months after giving birth to Gaskell, her husband sent the baby to live with Elizabeth's sister, Hannah Lumb, in Knutsford, Cheshire. \nHer father remarried to Catherine Thomson, in 1814. They had a son, William, in 1815, and a daughter, Catherine, in 1816. Although Elizabeth spent several years without seeing her father, to whom she was devoted, her older brother John often visited her in Knutsford. John was destined for the Royal Navy from an early age, like his grandfathers and uncles, but he did not obtain preferment into the Service and had to join the Merchant Navy with the East India Company's fleet. John went missing in 1827 during an expedition to India.\n\n\n== Character and influences ==\nMuch of Elizabeth's childhood was spent in Cheshire, where she lived with her aunt Hannah Lumb in Knutsford, the town she immortalized as Cranford. They lived in a large red-brick house called The Heath (now Heathwaite). Elizabeth grew to be a beautiful young woman, well-groomed, tidily dressed, kind, gentle, and considerate of others.  Her temperament was calm and collected, joyous and innocent, she revelled in the simplicity of rural life. \nFrom 1821 to 1826 she attended a school in Warwickshire run by the Misses Byerley, first at Barford and from 1824 at Avonbank outside Stratford-on-Avon, where she received the traditional education in arts, the classics, decorum and propriety given to young ladies from relatively wealthy families at the time. Her aunts gave her the classics to read, and she was encouraged by her father in her studies and writing. Her brother John sent her modern books, and descriptions of his life at sea and his experiences abroad.\nAfter leaving school at the age of 16, Elizabeth travelled to London to spend time with her Holland cousins. She also spent some time in Newcastle upon Tyne (with the Rev William Turner's family) and from there made the journey to Edinburgh.  Her stepmother's brother was the miniature artist William John Thomson, who in 1832 painted her portrait (see top right).  A bust was sculpted by David Dunbar at the same time.\n\n\n== Married life and writing career ==\n\nOn 30 August 1832 Elizabeth married Unitarian min\nEmily is a 2022 British biographical drama film written and directed by Frances O'Connor in her directorial debut. It is a part-fictional portrait of English writer Emily Brontë (played by Emma Mackey), concentrating on a fictional romantic relationship with the young curate William Weightman. Fionn Whitehead, Oliver Jackson-Cohen, Alexandra Dowling, Amelia Gething, Adrian Dunbar and Gemma Jones also appear in supporting roles.\nEmily premiered at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival before being theatrically released in the United Kingdom by Warner Bros. Pictures on 14 October 2022.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAs Emily Brontë is ill and near death, her older sister Charlotte asks her what inspired her to write her novel Wuthering Heights.\nSometime in the past Charlotte, nearly graduated from school, returns home for a visit. Emily tries to talk to her about the fictional worlds she has been creating while Charlotte was at school, but Charlotte tries to dissuade her from these juvenile activities.\nAt the same time William Weightman, a new curate, arrives. While her sisters and several other young women seem enamoured of the young man, Emily is dismissive of him. While visiting the Brontë home, Weightman partakes in a game the Brontës have invented where they take turns donning a mask and impersonating a character, with the other members guessing who the character is. When it is Emily's turn, she claims to be possessed by the ghost of their deceased mother; a strong wind bursts open the windows. Charlotte, Anne and Branwell become distressed, while Weightman is disturbed by the scene. Emily buries the mask in the ground the next day.\nEmily goes with Charlotte to her school to learn to be a teacher, while her brother Branwell goes to study at the Royal Academy of Arts. Both Emily and Branwell return shortly after as failures, Branwell proclaiming he is now more interested in writing and Emily at a loss for what to do.\nEmily's father engages Weightman to teach Emily French, which he does, while arguing religious philosophy with her. Branwell encourages Emily to drink and play, and Emily uses some opium she finds in a desk, and has \"Freedom in thought\" tattooed on her arm like Branwell has; their favourite pastime involves staring in the window of a local family and scaring them at night. They are eventually caught, but when Emily denies her involvement, Branwell is sent to work for the family as a tutor as punishment. Branwell is caught kissing the mistress of the house and is sent elsewhere in disgrace.\nEmily and Weightman grow increasingly close and begin a romantic and sexual entanglement. When Charlotte returns and begins to suspect an affinity between the two, Weightman abruptly ends their relationship. Emily is devastated and takes out her anger on Branwell, telling him that his attempts at fiction are clichéd and trite. To move on with her life, Emily decides to leave with Charlotte for Brussels. She tells Weightman she no longer intends to write. Weightman writes Emily a letter urging her to change her mind, which he gives to Branwell, who reads its contents and does not pass on the message.\nIn Brussels, Emily has a vision of Weightman and shortly after receives news that he died of cholera. The sisters return to tend an ailing Branwell. His final act before dying is to give Emily Weightman's letter in which he urges her to continue to write. After Branwell's death Emily writes Wuthering Heights. Now on her death bed, Emily confesses to Charlotte that she was in love with Weightman, and asks Charlotte to burn the love letters between the two after she dies. Charlotte does so and begins to write her own works.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nEmma Mackey as Emily Brontë\nFionn Whitehead as Branwell Brontë\nOliver Jackson-Cohen as William Weightman\nAlexandra Dowling as Charlotte Brontë\nAmelia Gething as Anne Brontë\nAdrian Dunbar as Patrick Brontë\nGemma Jones as Aunt Branwell\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was announced in May 2020 with Emma Mackey cast in \nVillette ( vee-LET) is an 1853 novel written by English author Charlotte Brontë. After an unspecified family disaster, the protagonist Lucy Snowe travels from her native England to the fictional Continental city of Villette to teach at a girls' school, where she is drawn into adventure and romance.\nVillette was Charlotte Brontë's third and last novel published during her life. It was preceded in writing by The Professor (her posthumously published first novel, of which Villette is a reworking, though still not very similar), Jane Eyre, and Shirley.\n\n\n== Author's background ==\nIn 1842 Charlotte Brontë, at the age of 26, travelled to Brussels, Belgium, with her sister Emily. There they enrolled in a pensionnat (boarding school) run by M. and Mme. Constantin Heger. In return for board and tuition, Charlotte taught English and Emily taught music.\nThe sisters' time at the pensionnat was cut short when their aunt, Elizabeth Branwell, died in October 1842. Elizabeth had joined the Brontë family to care for the children after the death of her sister, their mother Maria Brontë, née Maria Branwell.\nCharlotte returned, alone, to Brussels in January 1843 to take up a teaching post at the pensionnat. Her second stay in Brussels was not a happy one. She became lonely and homesick, and fell in love with M. Héger, a married man. She finally returned to her family's rectory in Haworth, England, in January 1844.\nCharlotte drew on this source material for her first (albeit unsuccessful) novel The Professor. After several publishers had rejected it, Brontë reworked the material and made it the basis of Villette. Most literary historians believe that the character of M. Paul Emanuel is closely based upon that of M. Héger. Furthermore, the character of Graham Bretton is widely acknowledged to have been modelled upon Brontë's publisher, George Murray Smith.\n\n\n== Locale ==\nThe novel is initially set in the English countryside, and later follows Lucy Snowe, the main character to the fictional town of Villette, a Gothic town where the majority of the action takes place. Villette is modelled upon the city of Brussels and is set in the fictional French-speaking kingdom of Labassecour (modelled on Belgium). \"La basse-cour\" is French for \"the farmyard\".\n\n\n== Characters ==\nLucy Snowe: The narrator and main character of Villette. A quiet, self-reliant, intelligent, 23-year-old woman. Lucy has, as Miss Ginevra Fanshawe asserts, \"no attractive accomplishments – no beauty\" as Lucy does her best not to stand out or form attachments. Although she seems to lack any living relatives, she is the god-daughter of Mrs. Bretton.\nThough usually reserved and emotionally self-controlled, Lucy has strong feelings and affections for those whom she really values. She even sincerely cares for the giddy Ginevra, albeit in a blunt, curmudgeonly fashion. She is a firm Protestant and denounces Roman Catholicism as false (\"God is not with Rome\"). She falls in love with M. Emanuel and consents to marry him someday. With his help Lucy leaves Madame Beck's and establishes her own school.\nM. Paul Emanuel: An irascible, autocratic professeur at Madame Beck's pensionnat. He is also a relative of Madame Beck. Although he insults Lucy frequently, Lucy comes to relish his good qualities. He is generous; he delights in giving Lucy secret presents. He is kind and magnanimous, as is shown by his supporting and sheltering the elderly grandmother of his dead fiancée, Justine Marie, together with his former tutor (Père Silas) and a servant. He is a devout Catholic and tries to convert Lucy, a Protestant, to Catholicism but fails. As he grows closer to Lucy and falls in love with her everyone in his life attempts to keep them apart, and he is eventually banished to a family-owned plantation in Guadeloupe for three years. At the end of the novel, it is strongly hinted that he dies in a shipwreck attempting to return to Labassecour.\nDr. John Graham Bretton: A handsome young English gentleman who is \nElizabeth Branwell (1776 – 25 October 1842) was the aunt of the literary sisters Charlotte Brontë, Emily Brontë and Anne Brontë.\nCalled 'Aunt Branwell', she helped raise the Brontë children after her sister, Maria Branwell, died in 1821. She managed the household until her own death in 1842.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nElizabeth Branwell was one of twelve children born to the Cornish couple Thomas Branwell and Anne Carne in Penzance, Cornwall. The family was very successful in the import and export trade while her father owned a brewery, an inn and the largest grocers' emporium in the town. The close-knit family was broken up by the death of Thomas Branwell in 1808 and of his wife the next year. Maria Branwell moved north to Yorkshire where she met her husband, Patrick Brontë, while Elizabeth most likely moved in with her married sister, Charlotte. It was for this sister that Maria's daughter, Charlotte Brontë, was named. Not much is known of Elizabeth's remaining time in Penzance, but she was a member of polite society and she had a private income of £50 which would have allowed her to live comfortably.\n\n\n== 'Aunt Branwell' ==\nElizabeth Branwell visited Maria in 1815 in Hartshead, Yorkshire where Patrick was curate. She would have then met her nieces Maria and Elizabeth, the latter of which was her namesake. Elizabeth helped her sister's family move to Thornton, Yorkshire where Patrick was offered a larger living. She stayed on with the family for a year and helped with Maria's confinement with Charlotte, born in 1816. Elizabeth Branwell returned to Penzance soon after the family settled in at Thornton. In the summer of 1821 she would be called back to Maria's side, this time in Haworth, Yorkshire, where her sister was suffering from ovarian cancer. Maria died on 15 September 1821, after a long agony. Elizabeth decided to stay on temporarily to help take care of Maria and Patrick's six children.\n\n\n== Aunt, mother, friend ==\n\nWhen Elizabeth Branwell took over the care of her nieces and nephew, the oldest, Maria, was seven years old while the youngest, Anne, was only twenty months. Elizabeth, at 45, was considered a spinster and though she missed the warmth and familiarity of her Cornish homeland, she stayed in the cold and secluded Haworth to help Patrick raise and educate his children. She kept the family on a strict routine and was mostly concerned with running the house and caring for the little ones. When the two eldest girls, Maria and Elizabeth, died from tuberculosis contracted at the Cowan Bridge School, Patrick decided to keep the children at home where he and Elizabeth would oversee their education. Branwell Brontë, the only boy of the family, especially doted upon \"Aunt Branwell\" as he craved a mother figure in the wake of the death of his own.\n\n\n== Influence on Brontës ==\nElizabeth Branwell subscribed to several magazines that the children enjoyed reading as youths. Charlotte remembers \"reading them by stealth and with the most exquisite pleasure.\" Elizabeth also continued to receive her annual income and needed very little money to live upon. As a result, she was able to fund many of the Brontë's adventures that would otherwise have proved impossible. She gave the girls money to open a boarding school, though the project failed to attract any pupils. She also paid for Charlotte and Emily's trip to Brussels to study French.\n\n\n== Death ==\nElizabeth Branwell unexpectedly fell ill in October 1842 with a bowel obstruction. Charlotte and Emily were in Brussels at the time and were notified of their aunt's illness. It was too late, however, as Elizabeth died four days later on 25 October 1842 in Haworth, Yorkshire. Branwell, rumoured to have been Elizabeth's favourite, was devastated. He wrote to a friend \"I have now lost the guide and director of all the happy days connected with my childhood.\" She was buried in the family vault near the remains of her sister and two nieces.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBrontë websi\nThe Brontë Sisters (French: Les Sœurs Brontë) is a 1979 French biographical drama film directed by André Téchiné, who co-wrote the screenplay with Pascal Bonitzer and Jean Gruault. The film stars Isabelle Adjani, Marie-France Pisier and Isabelle Huppert as the Brontë sisters. The cinematography was by Bruno Nuytten. It was a project that Téchiné  wanted to make since 1972, but only after the favourable reception of Souvenirs d'en France (1975) and Barocco (1976), he was able to find the necessary financing. Produced by Gaumont, the film's originally running time was cut from three to less than two hours upon its release at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival.\nThe film stars Isabelle Adjani as Emily, Marie-France Pisier  as Charlotte and Isabelle Huppert as Anne. Pascal Greggory plays their brother Branwell Brontë. The plot centres on the sisters' sombre relationship with Branwell.\nSet in a careful recreation of the period, the film follows the bleak lives of the four siblings in less than a ten-year span. It begins in 1834, when, at the age of seventeen, Branwell painted the famous portrait of his three sisters, in which he originally included his own image, and ends around 1852 when Charlotte, now a famous author, is the only surviving sibling.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nFour young siblings: Charlotte, Branwell, Emily and Anne, live a stoic existence in a small village in the English country side. Their old father, an Anglican minister, a rigid spinster aunt and Tabby, the maid, complete their household. The siblings have artistic ambitions and rely upon each other for companionship. Branwell is a painter and a self-portrait with his sisters is worthy of the general admiration of the family. He wants to pursue a professional career, but only goes as far as to establish a friendship with Leyland, a sculptor. Emily's favorite pastime is to walk across the bleak moors that surround the village dressed as a man. Anne, the youngest of the siblings, is her companion. Charlotte, more ambitious than the others, convinces their reluctant aunt to give her money to go to Belgium in order to study French. Her idea is to eventually come back and open a school. With their aunt's money and permission, Charlotte and Emily go to Brussels. Once there, Charlotte falls secretly in love with her teacher Monsieur Heger, who is already married. Emily plays the piano at school, but has a hard time there and is teased by her classmates for being English and Protestant in a Catholic country. Meanwhile, in England, Anne finds employment as a governess, taking over the education of the daughter of a wealthy family.\nWhile his sisters are away, Branwell deals alone with the death of their aunt. Her death makes Emily and Charlotte come back home. Emily is relieved and helps Branwell to find solace, taking him to the Black Bull Inn, the tavern and hotel of the town. Charlotte, on the other hand, lovesick, returns as soon as possible to Brussels to be reunited with Monsieur Heger, but her love is unrequited. Thanks to Anne, the aimless dreamer Branwell finds a steady job as the teacher of Edmund, the young son of the Robinson family, Anne's wealthy employers. Mr Robinson is strict, and, with his air of superiority, humiliates both Anne and Branwell. Mrs Robinson, flirty and unsatisfied, starts an ill-fated affair with Branwell. When Anne finds out about their relationship, she quits her job and returns home. Both Branwell and Charlotte have to deal with their broken hearts. After the death of her husband, Mrs Robinson sends Branwell a letter ending their affair.\nBranwell's life takes a dark turn. He gives himself over to drinking and becomes addicted to opium. During a windy night, a fire starts in his bedroom and he has to be rescued from amongst the flames by his sisters. Sneaking into Emily's bedroom and searching amongst her things, Charlotte discovers Emily's poems. Deeply impressed, she finally is able to convince the reluctant Emily to have them published.

Emily was the second youngest of six siblings, preceded by Maria, Elizabeth, Charlotte and Branwell.  In 1820, Emily's younger sister Anne, the last Brontë child, was born. Shortly thereafter, the family moved eight miles away to Haworth, where Patrick was employed as perpetual curate.  In Haworth, the children would have opportunities to develop their literary talents.\nWhen Emily was only three, and all six children under the age of eight, she and her siblings lost their mother, Maria, to cancer on 15 September 1821.

The version Ó Proinntigh, which was first given by Patrick Woulfe in his Sloinnte Gaedheal is Gall (transl. Surnames of the Gael and the Foreigner) and reproduced without question by Edward MacLysaght, cannot be accepted as correct, as there were a number of well-known scribes with this name writing in Irish in the 17th and 18th centuries and all of them used the spelling Ó Pronntaigh. The name is derived from the word pronntach or bronntach, which is related to the word bronnadh, meaning \"giving\" or \"bestowal\" (pronn is given as an Ulster version of bronn in O'Reilly's Irish English Dictionary.) Patrick Woulfe suggested that it was derived from proinnteach (the refectory of a monastery). Ó Pronntaigh was earlier anglicised as Prunty and sometimes Brunty."

Multiple theories exist to account for the change, including that he may have wished to hide his humble origins. As a man of letters, he would have been familiar with classical Greek and may have chosen the name after the Greek βροντή (transl. thunder). One view, which biographer C. K. Shorter proposed in 1896, is that he adapted his name to associate himself with Admiral Horatio Nelson, who was also Duke of Bronte.

Jane Eyre, along with Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, is one of the most famous romance novels. It is considered one of the greatest novels in the English language, and in 2003 was ranked as the tenth best-loved book in Britain by the BBC in The Big Read poll."

Two of the sisters, Maria and Elizabeth died from tuberculosis in the aftermath of a typhoid outbreak at the school. \nIn the 1830s the school moved to Casterton, a few miles away, where it was amalgamated with another girls' school. The (later headmistress) Dorothy Wilkinson travelled from Tasmania as a girl to attend in 1896.

The family was very successful in the import and export trade while her father owned a brewery, an inn and the largest grocers' emporium in the town. The close-knit family was broken up by the death of Thomas Branwell in 1808 and of his wife the next year. Maria Branwell moved north to Yorkshire where she met her husband, Patrick Brontë, while Elizabeth most likely moved in with her married sister, Charlotte. It was for this sister that Maria's daughter, Charlotte Brontë, was named. Not much is known of Elizabeth's remaining time in Penzance, but she was a member of polite society and she had a private income of £50 which would have allowed her to live comfortably."

        "content": "Jane Eyre ( AIR; originally published as Jane Eyre: An Autobiography) is a novel by the English writer Charlotte Brontë. It was published under her pen name \"Currer Bell\" on 19 October 1847 by Smith, Elder & Co. of London. The first American edition was published the following year by Harper & Brothers of New York. Jane Eyre is a bildungsroman that follows the experiences of its eponymous heroine, including her growth to adulthood and her love for Mr Rochester, the brooding master of Thornfield Hall.\nThe novel revolutionised prose fiction, being the first to focus on the moral and spiritual development of its protagonist through an intimate first-person narrative, where actions and events are coloured by a psychological intensity. Charlotte Brontë has been called the \"first historian of the private consciousness\" and the literary ancestor of writers such as Marcel Proust and James Joyce.\nThe book contains elements of social criticism with a strong sense of Christian morality at its core, and it is considered by many to be ahead of its time because of Jane's individualistic character and how the novel approaches the topics of class, sexuality, religion and feminism. Jane Eyre, along with Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, is one of the most famous romance novels. It is considered one of the greatest novels in the English language, and in 2003 was ranked as the tenth best-loved book in Britain by the BBC in The Big Read poll.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nJane Eyre is divided into 38 chapters. It was originally published in three volumes in the 19th century, consisting of chapters 1 to 15, 16 to 27, and 28 to 38.\nThe second edition was dedicated to William Makepeace Thackeray.\nThe novel is a first-person narrative from the perspective of the title character. Its setting is somewhere in the north of England, late in the reign of George III (1760–1820). It has five distinct stages: Jane's childhood at Gateshead Hall, where she is emotionally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins; her education at Lowood School, where she gains friends and role models but suffers privations and oppression; her time as governess at Thornfield Hall, where she falls in love with her mysterious employer, Edward Fairfax Rochester; her time in the Moor House, during which her earnest but cold clergyman cousin, St John Rivers, proposes to her; and ultimately her reunion with, and marriage to, her beloved Rochester. Throughout these sections it provides perspectives on a number of important social issues and ideas, many of which are critical of the status quo.\nThe five stages of Jane's life are as follows:\n\n\n=== Gateshead Hall ===\n\nJane Eyre, aged 10, lives at Gateshead Hall with her maternal uncle's family, the Reeds, as a result of her uncle's dying wish. Jane was orphaned several years earlier when her parents died of typhus. Jane's uncle, Mr Reed, was the only one in the Reed family who was kind to Jane. Jane's aunt, Sarah Reed, dislikes her and treats her as a burden. Mrs Reed also discourages her three children from associating with Jane. As a result Jane becomes defensive against her cruel judgement. The nursemaid, Bessie, proves to be Jane's only ally in the household, even though Bessie occasionally scolds Jane harshly. Excluded from the family activities, Jane lives an unhappy childhood.\nOne day, as punishment for defending herself against the bullying of her 14-year-old cousin John, the Reeds' only son, Jane is locked in the red room in which her late uncle had died; there she faints from panic after she thinks she has seen his ghost. The red room is significant because it lays the grounds for the \"ambiguous relationship between parents and children\" which plays out in all of Jane's future relationships with male figures throughout the novel. She is subsequently attended to by the kindly apothecary, Mr Lloyd, to whom Jane reveals how unhappy she is living at Gateshead Hall. He recommends to Mrs Reed that Jane should be sent to school, an idea Mrs Reed ha\nJane Eyre is a 2011 romantic drama film directed by Cary Fukunaga and starring Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender. The screenplay is written by Moira Buffini based on Charlotte Brontë's 1847 novel of the same name.\nThe film was released on 11 March 2011 in the United States and 9 September in Great Britain and Ireland. It received positive reviews from critics. The film's costume design, led by Michael O'Connor, was nominated for an Academy Award.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nA tearful Jane Eyre runs away from Thornfield Hall, finding herself alone on the moors. She collapses at the doorstep of Moor House, home of St. John Rivers and his sisters Diana and Mary; they take Jane in and nurse her back to health.\nThe film flashes between Jane's recovery and her grim childhood. An orphan, she is treated cruelly by her cousin John and aunt Mrs. Reed. Jane is sent to the Lowood School for Girls; under the strict Mr. Brocklehurst, the girls are beaten, but Jane befriends fellow pupil Helen Burns, who dies of consumption.\nEight years later, Jane, now 18, leaves Lowood for a position at Thornfield Hall. Welcomed by the kindly housekeeper Mrs. Fairfax, Jane begins a plain and isolated life as governess to Adèle Varens, the young French ward of Thornfield's owner. One day, Jane sees a rider thrown by his horse and comes to his aid. Returning to Thornfield, she learns the man is Edward Rochester, master of the house. He grudgingly praises her instruction of Adèle, and her own \"openess and unpolluted mind;” the two find themselves curiously attracted to one another.\nOne night, Jane discovers Rochester's room on fire, which they manage to extinguish; he warns her not to speak of the incident, and they share a chaste but passionate moment. The next day, Rochester leaves suddenly to call on Blanche Ingram, who Mrs. Fairfax tells Jane is Rochester's prospective wife; she and her family return with him a few weeks later on a grand visit to Thornfield.\nRochester confronts Jane, who is hurt by Blanche's presence, but is interrupted by an unexpected guest – Richard Mason from Spanish Town, Jamaica, whose arrival disturbs Rochester. That night, the household is awakened by a scream. Rochester reassures the guests, but brings Jane to tend to Mason, who has been badly injured. Jane notices a hidden door in Rochester's room before Mason is taken away by a doctor. Rochester confides in Jane, cryptically, that he is haunted by a past mistake but has fallen for a new woman in his life; Jane believes he means Blanche.\nJane receives word that her cousin John has committed suicide, leading her aunt to suffer a stroke. Jane returns to her dying aunt, who gives her a letter from Jane's paternal uncle, John Eyre, asking that Jane live with him in Madeira as his heir. The letter is three years old, and Mrs. Reed admits to writing to John to the effect that Jane had died at Lowood. Jane forgives her aunt and returns to Thornfield, beginning a correspondence with John.\nFaced with Rochester's impending marriage to Blanche, Jane tells Rochester she will leave Thornfield and confesses her true feelings for him. Rochester declares that Jane is his only love and proposes; she accepts. At their wedding, Mason appears with a lawyer and reveals that Rochester is already married to Mason's sister, Bertha. Rochester admits the truth and takes Jane to meet his violently deranged wife, kept in a hidden room at Thornfield. Rochester explains that his father made him marry Bertha for her money, but she gradually descended into madness and he locked her away rather than subject her to an asylum; she had been responsible for the strange happenings in the house. Rochester pleads with Jane to stay, but wounded by his deception, she leaves Thornfield.\nAfter her recovery at Moor House, St. John gives Jane a teaching position and a cottage. One night, she imagines a knock at her door to be Rochester, but instead finds St. John with news that her uncle John has died and left her his fortune of £20,0\nJane Eyre is a 2006 television adaptation of Charlotte Brontë's 1847 novel of the same name. The story, which has been the subject of numerous television and film adaptations, is based on the life of the orphaned title character. This four-part BBC television drama serial adaptation was broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One.\nThe drama is generally considered a successful adaptation, garnering critical acclaim and a number of nominations from various award bodies.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn this version of Charlotte Brontë's novel, Jane Eyre (Georgie Henley) is raised as a poor relation in the household of her aunt, Mrs. Reed (Tara Fitzgerald). As a young woman (Ruth Wilson), Jane is hired by the housekeeper of Thornfield Hall, Mrs. Fairfax, to be a governess for young Adèle (Cosima Littlewood). The owner of the estate is Mr. Rochester (Toby Stephens), who is courting the beautiful Blanche Ingram (Christina Cole).\n\n\n=== Episode One ===\nAfter the death of her maternal uncle, the orphaned child Jane Eyre is left to the care of her uncaring and cruel aunt Mrs Reed. In their house at Gateshead Hall, Jane is ill-treated by her three first cousins and aunt alike and never feels at home. After one of many ill-treatments she is accused of being bad blood and in an attempt to get rid of her, Jane is sent to Lowood School by Mrs Reed. Like Gateshead Hall, Lowood School is a cold institution. Jane's only friend at school, Helen Burns, dies and Jane is left alone once again. Resolving to become independent, she takes on the profession of a governess.\nAt the age of eighteen, she is able to secure a position as governess to a girl at Thornfield Hall. Here Jane learns that her pupil, a French girl named Adele, is the ward of the master of the house, Edward Rochester, who had had her mother, Celine Verans, as his mistress, and that she had left her illegitimate daughter in his care. She is also informed that the master of the house is seldom at home.\nOn one of his journeys back to Thornfield Hall, Jane at last meets Rochester.\nOne night, Jane wakes to strange noises coming from Rochester's room. She follows the noise and realizes that Rochester's room has been set on fire and the master in danger.\n\n\n=== Episode Two ===\nAfter Jane is able to rescue Rochester just in time, she wonders who set the fire and from whom these strange sounds from the North Tower came. She barely receives an answer from Rochester who instead leaves Thornfield without notice the next morning. On his return to Thornfield, he brings along some acquaintances among whom are the beautiful Blanche Ingram and her mother Lady Ingram.\nRochester receives another unexpected and not wholly welcome guest. Mason, the guest, is severely injured one night. While Rochester fetches a doctor, Jane is left to take care of Mason in the North Tower. Once again strange sounds from the North Tower precede the incident. While looking after Mason, Jane is startled by loud noises from the other side of the door in the North Tower.\n\n\n=== Episode Three ===\nJane receives a visitor from her troubled past. Bessie informs her of her aunt's illness and the request to see Jane before she dies. Jane asks Mrs. Reed why she always hated her niece. Mrs. Reed replies that it was because her husband had loved Jane more than his own children, even calling out for her on his deathbed. Jane also learns from her aunt that she has an uncle. This uncle asked to take care of Jane when she was still a child. Her aunt misinformed the uncle and told him that Jane died. Unlike her aunt, Jane is able to forgive Mrs. Reed on her aunt's death bed.\nAway from Thornfield Hall, Jane realizes with more clarity that Thornfield has indeed become a home for her, something she never had before. However, the rumours of an upcoming marriage between Blanche Ingram and Mr. Rochester disturb her immensely. Is she to leave her beloved Thornfield?\nIn an attempt to discover Jane's real emotions, Rochester constantly teases Jane so that she finall\nJane Eyre is the fictional heroine and the titular protagonist in Charlotte Brontë's 1847 novel of the same name. The story follows Jane's infancy and childhood as an orphan, her employment first as a teacher and then as a governess, and her romantic involvement with her employer, the mysterious and moody Edward Rochester. Jane is noted by critics for her dependability, strong mindedness, and individualism. The author deliberately created Jane as an unglamorous figure, in contrast to conventional heroines of fiction, and possibly part-autobiographical.\nJane is a popular literary figure due to critical acclaim by readers for the impact she held on romantic and feminist writing. The novel has been adapted into a number of other forms, including theatre, film and television.\n\n\n== Development ==\nJane Eyre is an orphan living with her maternal uncle and his wealthy wife, Mrs. Reed. After Mr. Reed's death, his wife is left to care for Jane. Jane is mistreated by her aunt who resents, neglects, and abuses her while claiming that the only reason for her care of Jane is charity, which leads to Jane's overall anger towards the Reed family.\nAfter a violent argument with her older cousin John, Jane is locked into the Red Room, the room which Mr. Reed died in and which Jane believes is haunted. After Jane believes that she sees her uncle's ghost in the Red Room, she falls ill and faints. This leads to her being sent away to a school on the recommendation of the apothecary, Mr. Lloyd, who attends her, in lieu of a physician.\nMrs. Reed then sends Jane to Lowood Institution, a school for poor and orphaned girls. At Lowood, Jane is faced with Mr. Brocklehurst, who funds the school which his mother founded but is abusive in his oversight of the girls. At the school Jane befriends Helen Burns, from whom she learns to be not only patient but also calm. Helen Burns later dies of consumption, while Jane survives a typhus epidemic at the school premises.\nDuring her time at Lowood, Jane receives a thorough education and becomes a friend of Miss Maria Temple, the school's principal. After six years of schooling and two years of teaching at Lowood (without once returning to the Reeds' house in Gateshead) Jane decides to go out into the world on her own. She seeks work as a governess and is employed at Thornfield Hall to care for a French born orphan, Adèle. At Thornfield, Jane learns about the absent master, Mr. Rochester, and starts to teach his ward.\nOne evening, when Jane is out walking, she helps a mysterious man when his horse slips and he falls. She later learns that this is Mr. Rochester, her master. Jane and Rochester are immediately interested in each other. She is fascinated by his rough and dark appearance, as well as his abrupt, almost rude, manner, which she thinks is easier to handle than polite flattery. As for Mr. Rochester, he is very interested in Jane's strength of character, comparing her to an elf or sprite and admiring her unusual strength and stubbornness.\nRochester quickly learns that he can rely on Jane in a crisis. One night, after everybody has retired, strange sounds and smoke lead her to Rochester's room, where she finds Rochester asleep in his bed with all the curtains and bedclothes on fire; she puts out the flames and rescues him.\nWhile Jane is working at Thornfield, Rochester invites his acquaintances over for a week-long stay, including the beautiful Blanche Ingram. Rochester lets Blanche flirt with him constantly in front of Jane to make her jealous and encourages rumours that he is engaged to Blanche, which devastates Jane.\nDuring the house party, a man named Richard Mason arrives, and Rochester appears to be afraid of him. At night, Mason sneaks up to the third floor and somehow gets stabbed and bitten. Rochester asks Jane to tend Richard Mason's wounds secretly while he fetches the doctor. The next morning before the guests find out what happened, Rochester sneaks Mason out of the house.\nBefore Jane can discover mo\nJane Eyre is a 1943 American film adaptation of Charlotte Brontë's 1847 novel of the same name, released by 20th Century Fox. It was directed by Robert Stevenson and produced by the uncredited Kenneth Macgowan and Orson Welles; Welles also stars in the film as Edward Rochester, with Joan Fontaine playing the title character.\nThe screenplay was written by John Houseman, Aldous Huxley, and director Robert Stevenson. The musical score was composed and conducted by Bernard Herrmann, and the cinematography was by George Barnes.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\nOrphaned, unloved, and unwanted ten-year-old Jane Eyre lives with her cruel, selfish, uncaring maternal aunt via marriage, Mrs. Reed of Gateshead Hall, and her spoiled, bullying son. Jane is ecstatic when Mrs. Reed, eager to be rid of her, arranges for Jane to be sent to Lowood Institution, a charity boarding school for young girls, run by the disciplinarian Mr. Brocklehurst.\nBased on what Mrs. Reed has told him, Mr. Brocklehurst labels Jane a liar in front of her schoolmates and orders her to stand on a stool for hours on her first day of attendance. She is comforted and befriended by another student, Helen Burns. Later, Jane protests when Brocklehurst orders that Helen's naturally curling hair be cut. Both are punished by being forced to walk circles in a courtyard during a downpour. Dr. Rivers, a sympathetic physician who periodically checks on the students, brings the girls inside, but it is too late for Helen, who dies that night.\nTen years later, in 1840, twenty-year-old Jane turns down Brocklehurst's offer of a teaching position. She advertises for and accepts a job as governess for a young girl named Adèle. When Jane arrives at Thornfield, a gloomy, isolated mansion, she initially thinks her employer is Mrs. Fairfax, who is in fact the housekeeper for the absent master.\nJane goes for a walk one night only to startle a horse into throwing and slightly injuring its rider, Edward Rochester—who she doesn't realize is her employer. When Jane arrives back at Thornfield, she discovers this fact, and Rochester calls her into his library to interview her. His brusque manner contrasts with her quiet, gentle demeanor, and he finally dismisses her with the wish that she will enjoy her stay there.\nThat night, Jane is awakened by strange laughter. She investigates, and discovers that Rochester's bed curtains are on fire. She rouses the sleeping man and they extinguish the fire without rousing anyone. Rochester bids her wait while he goes to another wing of the house, where mysterious seamstress Grace Poole keeps to herself. When he returns, he tells Jane nothing other than that the matter is under control. The next morning, he leaves Thornfield.\nA winter and spring go by before he returns with a large group of guests. Jane is greatly saddened when Mrs. Fairfax discloses that everyone expects Rochester to marry the vivacious and snobbish Blanche Ingram. However, Rochester confides to Jane his conviction that Blanche is attracted only by his wealth.\nWhen a man named Richard Mason of Spanish Town, Jamaica, arrives at Thornfield, Jane sees that Rochester is disturbed. That night, a pained scream awakens everyone. Rochester assures his guests it is just a servant's reaction to a nightmare, but after he sends them back to their rooms, he has Jane secretly tend to a bleeding Mason in the tower while he fetches a doctor. Behind her, a locked wooden door rattles with someone trying to get out, but Rochester orders Jane to ignore everything she sees or hears. Rochester has the doctor take Mason away.\nRochester has a private conversation with Blanche, in which he bluntly asserts that she is a gold digger. Offended, she and the other guests leave. Unaware of this development, Jane broaches the topic of her future employment elsewhere after Rochester gets married, and confesses that she does not want to leave Rochester. In response, Rochester reveals that he loves her and not Blanche, and proposes marriage to her\nJane Eyre is a 1996 romantic drama film adaptation of Charlotte Brontë's 1847 novel Jane Eyre. This Hollywood version, directed by Franco Zeffirelli, is similar to the original novel, although it compresses and eliminates most of the plot in the last quarter of the book (the running away, the trials and tribulations, new-found relations, and new job) to condense it into a two-hour film.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nJane Eyre (portrayed as the orphan girl by Anna Paquin and as an independent woman by Charlotte Gainsbourg) is a plain, impoverished lady hired by Mr. Rochester (William Hurt) through Mrs. Fairfax (Joan Plowright) to work as a governess for Adèle (Josephine Serre). Despite her mild unprepossessing nun-like manner, Jane has strong hidden passions and shows her strong character by expressing her opinions and showing resolve in times of trouble. Rochester is a Byronic anti-hero, tortured and tormented by family troubles, past injustices and secrets. Rochester and Jane develop a mutual affinity. They fall in love and the marriage date is set. What Jane does not realize is that she must share the estate and, ultimately, Mr. Rochester with his wife, Bertha (Maria Schneider), who is mentally ill and is confined in an upstairs attic with a nurse, Grace Poole (Billie Whitelaw).\nThe marriage is stopped by Bertha's brother Richard Mason (Edward de Souza) and lawyer Briggs (Peter Woodthorpe). Jane flees; her world in ruins. She recovers in the parsonage, her aunt's original home, and discovers she is now wealthy through inheriting her long-lost uncle's fortune in Madeira. She receives a proposal of marriage from Parson St. John Rivers but her heart and soul are with Rochester. Jane goes back to find Rochester's house, Thornfield Hall, burnt down and Rochester crippled and blinded by a fire set by Bertha, who perished. However, Jane's love for Rochester is undiminished; she nurses him back to health, he recovers his eyesight and they marry.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe location for Thornfield Hall is Haddon Hall, Bakewell, Derbyshire, UK. Since Zeffirelli's use of Haddon Hall, subsequent versions of Jane Eyre have used it and it is now apparently synonymous with Thornfield Hall. Prior to Zeffirelli's location use, Haddon Hall had been once used (before Jane Eyre) as the castle for The Princess Bride.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was released on VHS and DVD by Miramax on February 24, 2003. The film debuted on the Blu-ray format for the first time on September 11, 2012 in a double feature with Becoming Jane (2007), released by Echo Bridge Entertainment.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film holds a positive rating of 75% at Rotten Tomatoes based on 28 reviews. The New York Times called Hurt \"embarrassingly miscast as a Rochester more nearly a mild eccentric than a brooding, Byronic type\", but conceded that the film \"has its moments\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJane Eyre at IMDb\nJane Eyre at Rotten Tomatoes\nReview at JaneEyre.net\nJane Eyre, the 1847 novel by English writer Charlotte Brontë, has frequently been adapted for film, radio, television, and theatre, and has also inspired a number of rewritings and reinterpretations.\n\n\n== Film ==\n\n\n=== Silent films ===\n1910: Jane Eyre, starring Irma Taylor (Jane), Marie Eline (Young Jane), and Frank Hall Crane (Rochester)\n1914: Jane Eyre, starring Lisbeth Blackstone, Dallas Tyler, Harrish Ingraham, and John Charles\n1914: Jane Eyre, directed by Frank Hall Crane, starring Ethel Grandin (Jane) and Irving Cummings (Rochester)\n1915: Jane Eyre, starring Louise Vale\n1915: The Castle of Thornfield, produced in Italy\n1918: Woman and Wife, adapted by Paul West, directed by Edward José, starring Alice Brady\n1921: Jane Eyre, directed by Hugo Ballin, starring Norman Trevor and Mabel Ballin\n1926: Orphan of Lowood, produced in Germany, directed by Curtis Bernhardt\n\n\n=== Sound films ===\n1934: Jane Eyre, starring Colin Clive and Virginia Bruce\n1943: I Walked with a Zombie, a Val Lewton horror movie loosely based on Jane Eyre, starring Tom Conway and Frances Dee\n1943: Jane Eyre, screenplay by John Houseman and Aldous Huxley, starring Orson Welles (Rochester), Joan Fontaine (Jane), Agnes Moorehead (Mrs. Reed), Margaret O'Brien (Adele), Peggy Ann Garner (Young Jane), and Elizabeth Taylor (Helen Burns).Fontaine also starred in Alfred Hitchcock's 1940 film Rebecca, based upon the Daphne du Maurier novel influenced by Jane Eyre.\n1952: Sangdil (also known as Jane Eyre), an Indian Hindi-language version directed by R.

She is best known for her novel Jane Eyre, which she published under the male pseudonym Currer Bell. Jane Eyre went on to become a success in publication, and is widely held in high regard in the gothic fiction genre of literature.\nBrontë enrolled in school at Roe Head, Mirfield, in January 1831, aged 14 years. She left the year after to teach her sisters, Emily and Anne, at home, then returned to Roe Head in 1835 as a teacher. In 1839, she undertook the role of governess for the Sidgwick family, but left after a few months. The three sisters attempted to open a school in Haworth but failed to attract pupils. Instead, they turned to writing; they each first published in 1846 under the pseudonyms of Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. Although her first novel, The Professor, was rejected by publishers, her second novel, Jane Eyre, was published in 1847. The sisters admitted to their Bell pseudonyms in 1848, and by the following year were celebrated in London literary circles.\nBrontë was the last to die of all her siblings. She became pregnant shortly after her wedding in June 1854 but died on 31 March 1855, almost certainly from hyperemesis gravidarum, a complication of pregnancy which causes excessive nausea and vomiting.\n\n\n== Early years and education ==\nCharlotte Brontë was born on 21 April 1816 in Market Street, Thornton (in a house now known as the Brontë Birthplace), west of Bradford in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the third of the six children of Maria (née Branwell) and Patrick Brontë (formerly surnamed Brunty), an Irish Anglican clergyman. In 1820 her family moved a few miles to the village of Haworth, on the edge of the moors, where her father had been appointed perpetual curate of St Michael and All Angels Church. Maria died of cancer on 15 September 1821, leaving five daughters, Maria, Elizabeth, Charlotte, Emily and Anne, and a son, Branwell, to be taken care of by her sister, Elizabeth Branwell.\nIn August 1824, Patrick sent Charlotte, Emily, Maria, and Elizabeth to the Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge in Lancashire. Charlotte maintained that the school's poor conditions permanently affected her health and physical development, and hastened the deaths of Maria (born 1814) and Elizabeth (born 1815), who both died of tuberculosis in May (Maria) and June (Elizabeth) 1825. After the deaths of his older daughters, Patrick removed Charlotte and Emily from the school. Charlotte used the school as the basis for Lowood School in Jane Eyre, which is similarly affected by tuberculosis that is exacerbated by the poor conditions.\nAt home in Haworth Parsonage, Brontë acted as \"the motherly friend and guardian of her younger sisters\". Brontë wrote her first known poem at the age of 13 in 1829, and was to go on to write more than 200 poems in the course of her life. Many of her poems were \"published\" in their homemade magazine Branwell's Blackwood's Magazine, and concerned the fictional world of Glass Town. She and her surviving siblings – Branwell, Emily and Anne – created this shared  world, and began chronicling the lives and struggles of the inhabitants of their imaginary kingdom in 1827. Charlotte, in private letters, called Glass Town \"her 'world below', a private escape where she could act out her desires and multiple identities\". Charlotte's \"predilection for romantic settings, passionate relationships, and high society is at odds with Branwell's obsession with battles and politics and her young sisters' homely North Country realism, none the less at this stage there is still a sense of the writings as a family enterprise\".\nHowever, from 1831 onwards, Emily and Anne 'seceded' from the Glass Town Confederacy to create a 'spin-off' called Gondal, which in\nJane Eyre is a 1997 British television film produced by London Weekend Television, that first broadcast on ITV and stars Samantha Morton in the title role. It is an adaptation of Charlotte Brontë's 1847 novel of the same name.\nThis version of the story is noted for omitting the middle scenes with Mrs Reed, the Rivers' relationship to Jane, and her paternal uncle's inheritance from his estate in Madeira. It was originally shown on ITV on 9 March 1997 in the UK and shown on A&E-TV on 19 October 1997 in the US. It is sometimes repeated on ITV3.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nSamantha Morton as Jane Eyre\nCiarán Hinds as Edward Fairfax Rochester\nLaura Harling as Young Jane\nRupert Penry-Jones as St. John Rivers\nGemma Jones as Mrs. Alice Fairfax\nTimia Berthome as Adele\nDavid Gant as Mr. Brocklehurst\nAbigail Cruttenden as Blanche Ingram\nBen Sowden as John Reed\nDeborah Findlay as Mrs.Reed\nKay Mellor as Mrs. Butterworth\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJane Eyre at IMDb\nJane Eyre at the BFI's Screenonline\nJane Eyre at AllMovie\nRotten Tomatoes reviews\nReview at JaneEyre.net\nAn Enthusiast's Guide to Jane Eyre Adaptations\nThe Brontës () were a nineteenth-century literary family, born in the village of Thornton and later associated with the village of Haworth in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England. The sisters, Charlotte (1816–1855), Emily (1818–1848) and Anne (1820–1849), are well-known poets and novelists. Like many contemporary female writers, they published their poems and novels under male pseudonyms: Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. Their stories attracted attention for their passion and originality immediately following their publication. Charlotte's Jane Eyre was the first to know success, while Emily's Wuthering Heights, Anne's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall and other works were accepted as masterpieces of literature after their deaths.\nThe first Brontë children to be born to rector Patrick Brontë and his wife Maria were Maria (1814–1825) and Elizabeth (1815–1825), who both died at young ages due to disease. Charlotte, Emily and Anne were then born within a time period of approximately four years. These three sisters and their brother, Branwell (1817–1848), who had been born after Charlotte and before Emily, were very close to each other. As children, they developed their imaginations first through oral storytelling and play, set in an intricate imaginary world, and then through the collaborative writing of increasingly complex stories set in their fictional world. The deaths of their mother and two older sisters marked them and influenced their writing profoundly, as did their isolated upbringing. They were raised in a religious family. The Brontë birthplace in Thornton is a place of pilgrimage and their later home, the parsonage at Haworth in Yorkshire, now the Brontë Parsonage Museum, has hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.\n\n\n== Origin of the name ==\nThe Brontë family can be traced to the Irish clan Ó Pronntaigh, which literally means \"descendant of Pronntach\". They were a family of hereditary scribes and literary men in Fermanagh. The version Ó Proinntigh, which was first given by Patrick Woulfe in his Sloinnte Gaedheal is Gall (transl. Surnames of the Gael and the Foreigner) and reproduced without question by Edward MacLysaght, cannot be accepted as correct, as there were a number of well-known scribes with this name writing in Irish in the 17th and 18th centuries and all of them used the spelling Ó Pronntaigh. The name is derived from the word pronntach or bronntach, which is related to the word bronnadh, meaning \"giving\" or \"bestowal\" (pronn is given as an Ulster version of bronn in O'Reilly's Irish English Dictionary.) Patrick Woulfe suggested that it was derived from proinnteach (the refectory of a monastery). Ó Pronntaigh was earlier anglicised as Prunty and sometimes Brunty.\nAt some point, Patrick Brontë (born Brunty), the sisters' father, decided on the alternative spelling with the diaeresis over the terminal ⟨e⟩ to indicate that the name has two syllables. Multiple theories exist to account for the change, including that he may have wished to hide his humble origins. As a man of letters, he would have been familiar with classical Greek and may have chosen the name after the Greek βροντή (transl. thunder). One view, which biographer C. K. Shorter proposed in 1896, is that he adapted his name to associate himself with Admiral Horatio Nelson, who was also Duke of Bronte. One might also find evidence for this theory in Patrick Brontë's desire to associate himself with the Duke of Wellington in his form of dress.\n\n\n== Family tree ==\n\n\n== Members of the Brontë family ==\n\n\n=== Patrick Brontë ===\n\nPatrick Brontë (17 March 1777 – 7 June 1861), the Brontë sisters' father, was born in Loughbrickland, County Down, Ireland, of a family of farm workers of moderate means. His birth name was Patrick Prunty or Brunty. His mother, Alice McClory, was of the Roman Catholic faith, whilst his father Hugh was a Protestant, and Patrick was brought up in his father's faith.\n\nHe was a bright young man and, after studying under the Rev.

She is the recipient of  numerous accolades, including the BAFTA Fellowship, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award and nominations for two Academy Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award.\nMorton was a member of the Central Junior Television Workshop in her native Nottingham and began her career in British television in 1991. She appeared in the ITV series Band of Gold (1995–1996) and the BBC miniseries The History of Tom Jones: a Foundling (1997). Morton's early film roles include Emma (1996), Jane Eyre (1997), and Under the Skin (1997). She received two Academy Award nominations, one for Best Supporting Actress for Woody Allen's Sweet and Lowdown (1999), and the other for Best Actress for Jim Sheridan's In America (2003). Other notable film credits include  Morvern Callar (2002),  Minority Report (2002), The Libertine (2004), Control (2007), Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007), Synecdoche, New York (2008), The Messenger (2009), John Carter (2012), Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016), and The Whale (2022). \nFor her portrayal of Myra Hindley in the Channel 4 and HBO film Longford (2006) she received Primetime Emmy Award, BAFTA Award, and Golden Globe Award nominations. Morton made her directorial debut with the television film The Unloved (2009), which won the BAFTA Television Award for Best Single Drama. She has starred in various programmes, such as The Last Panthers (2015), Rillington Place (2016), Harlots (2017–2019), The Walking Dead (2019–2020), and The Serpent Queen (2022–2024).\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMorton was born in Nottingham, the third child of Pamela (née Mallek), a factory worker, and Peter Morton. She is of Polish/Irish descent. She has six half-siblings from her parents' relationships subsequent to their 1979 divorce. She lived with her father until she was eight, when she was made a ward of court because neither of her parents could care for her and her siblings. Her father was an abusive alcoholic, and her mother was involved in a violent relationship with her second husband; as a result, she never lived with her parents again.\nThe next nine years were spent in and out of foster care and children's homes. During that time, she attended West Bridgford Comprehensive School and joined the Central Junior Television Workshop when she was 13, soon being offered small-screen roles in Soldier Soldier and Boon. \nUnder the effects of drugs, she threatened an older girl who had been bullying her. She was convicted of making threats to kill and served 18 weeks in an attendance centre.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings (1991–1998) ===\nAfter joining Central Junior Television Workshop at the age of 13, she was soon being offered small-screen roles such as Clare Anderson in the first series of Lucy Gannon's Soldier Soldier and also Mandy, in an episode of Boon —both were ITV Central productions. Moving to London at sixteen, Morton applied to numerous drama schools, including RADA, without success. In 1991, she attended Clarendon College of Performing Arts to gain a BTEC award but subsequently left for personal reasons. She made her stage début at the Royal Court Theatre, and continued her television career with appearances in Peak Practice and in an episode of Cracker. At the time, she had a regular role in the first two series of Kay Mellor's successful Band of Gold (1995–96).\nFurther television roles followed, including parts in period dramas such as Emma and Jane Eyre. Emma was a film adaptation of the novel of the same name published in 1815 about youthful hubris and the perils of misconstrued romance. The movie received largely positive reviews from critics and was broadcast in late 1996 on ITV, gaining an estimated 12 million viewers. In Jane Eyre, Morton starred as a Yorkshire orphan who becomes a governess to a young Frenc\nJane Eyre is a musical drama with music and lyrics by composer-lyricist Paul Gordon and a book by John Caird, based on the 1847 novel by Charlotte Brontë. The musical premiered on Broadway in 2000.\n\n\n== Production history ==\nA workshop of the musical was performed at Manhattan Theatre Club in 1995. The musical had a work-in-progress workshop production in Wichita, Kansas in Autumn 1995 at the Centre Theatre. Minor roles and the large ensemble of schoolgirls for the scenes at Brocklehurst's school were cast locally, while the directors brought several members of the principal cast from New York. The musical was well received, and a recording of this rendition allowed the creative team and their backers to slowly move the project towards an opening on Broadway. The musical had its world premiere at the Royal Alexandra Theatre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in late 1996. The musical then had a pre-Broadway try-out at La Jolla Playhouse, San Diego, California, July 14, 1999 to August 29, 1999. The cast had been reduced from 30 in Toronto to 19.\nThe musical debuted on Broadway at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre on November 9, 2000, with an official opening on December 10, 2000 and closed on June 10, 2001 after 36 previews and 209 performances. Marla Schaffel, who played the title character, won a Drama Desk Award and the Outer Critics Circle Award (in a tie with Christine Ebersole) for her performance. The production was directed by John Caird and Scott Schwartz, choreography by Jayne Paterson, set designer by John Napier, costumes by Andreane Neofitou, and lighting by Jules Fisher and Peggy Eisenhauer. Days after the Tony Award nominations were announced, a closing date of May 20 was announced. Alanis Morissette, a friend of Paul Gordon's, bought $150,000 worth of tickets to the musical and donated them to various charity groups. This would allow the show to be open past the Tony Award telecast, although the show closed a week after.\nYears later in 2018, it was announced a new version of the musical would have its world premiere at Cleveland Musical Theatre, directed by Miles Sternfeld. The new production would feature a 10-person cast, instead of the original 21, as well as new songs written by Gordon. Every actor in the ensemble (except Jane and Rochester) would play multiple roles throughout the course of the show. The production opened in late August to rave reviews. Cool Cleveland stated in their review: \"Jane Eyre in its new form and format is a musical that shows that a \"small\" production, in which care is taken with directing, casting and technical aspects, can make musical theater more captivating than big, splashy, overproduced shows\".\nThe 2023 Tokyo production was recorded for Blu-ray release.\n\n\n== Characters and original cast ==\n\n\n== Musical numbers ==\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\nAct 1\nJane Eyre, a young orphan, is living at Gateshead but is ill-treated by her Aunt Mrs. Reed and cousin John Reed. Jane is sent to a boarding school. Over the years, Jane becomes a teacher at the boarding school but longs to see other sights. She becomes a tutor of Adèle Varens, a young French girl who lives at Thornfield Hall as the ward of the owner, Edward Rochester. When a fire breaks out, Jane puts it out and saves Edward's life, and the two become close. Edward, however, cannot accept his affection for Jane, and so invites wealthy guests as a distraction. It appears that Blanche Ingram and Edward may be getting married, and Jane is unhappy over this.\nMason, an old friend, arrives, and Edward is disturbed. He asks Jane whether she would leave if he had a terrible secret, and she vows her faithfulness.\n\nAct 2\nWhen Mason is attacked in the attic, he is helped by Jane and Edward and leaves.\nEdward, pretending to be a gypsy, tells Blanche Ingram that he is not rich, and she hastily departs Thornfield. Edward at last tells Jane that he loves her and proposes marriage, and Jane happily accepts. However, on the day of the wedding, Mason tells the secret. Edw\nEdward Fairfax Rochester (often referred to as Mr Rochester) is a character in Charlotte Brontë's 1847 novel Jane Eyre. The brooding master of Thornfield Hall, Rochester is the employer and eventual husband of the novel's titular protagonist Jane Eyre. He is regarded as an archetypal Byronic hero.\n\n\n== In Jane Eyre ==\n\nEdward Rochester is the oft-absent master of Thornfield Hall, where Jane Eyre is employed as a governess to his young ward, Adèle Varens. Jane first meets Rochester while on a walk, when his horse slips and he injures his foot. He does not reveal to Jane his identity and it is only that evening back at the house that Jane learns he is Mr Rochester.\n\nRochester and Jane are immediately interested in each other. She is fascinated by his rough, dark appearance as well as his abrupt manner. Rochester is intrigued by Jane's strength of character, comparing her to an elf or sprite and admiring her unusual strength and stubbornness. The two quickly become friends, often arguing and discussing topical matters. Rochester confides to Jane that Adèle is the daughter of his past lover, French opera dancer Céline Varens, who had run off with another man. Rochester does not claim paternity of Adèle but had brought the orphaned child to England.\nRochester quickly learns that he can rely on Jane in a crisis. On one evening, Jane finds Rochester asleep in his bed with all the curtains and bedclothes on fire; she puts out the flames and rescues him. Jane and Rochester grow closer and fall in love with each other. \nWhile Jane is working at Thornfield, Rochester invites his acquaintances over for a week-long stay, including the beautiful socialite Blanche Ingram. Rochester lets Blanche flirt with him constantly in front of Jane to make her jealous and encourages rumours that he is engaged to Blanche, which devastates Jane. Rochester tells Jane he is to be married, at which point Jane is prepared to leave Thornfield, believing Blanche is his bride. Eventually Rochester stops teasing Jane, admitting that he loves her and that he never intended to marry Blanche, especially as he had exposed Blanche's interest in him as solely mercenary when he caused a rumour that he is far less wealthy than she imagined. He asks Jane to marry him and she accepts. \nDuring their wedding ceremony, two men arrive claiming that Rochester is already married. Rochester admits to this, but believes he is justified in his attempt to marry Jane. He takes the wedding party to see his wife of fifteen years, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, and explains the circumstances of his marriage. He claims he had been rushed into marrying Bertha by his father and the Mason family, and only after they were wed did he discover that Bertha is violently insane. Unable to live with Bertha due to her madness, Rochester tried to keep her existence a secret and kept her on the third floor of Thornfield Hall with a nursemaid, Grace Poole. It was Bertha who had set Rochester's bedsheets on fire, along with a number of other disruptive incidents. Rochester confesses that he had travelled around Europe for ten years trying to forget his failed marriage and keeping various mistresses. Eventually he gave up on searching for a woman he could love, came home to England, and fell in love with Jane.\nRochester asks Jane to go to France with him, where they can pretend to be a married couple. Jane refuses to be his mistress and runs from Thornfield. Much later, she finds out that Rochester searched for her everywhere, and, when he couldn't find her, sent everyone else away from Thornfield and shut himself up alone. After this, Bertha set the house on fire one night and burned it to the ground. Rochester rescued all the servants and tried to save Bertha, too, but she committed suicide by jumping from the roof of the house and he was injured. Now Rochester has lost an eye and a hand and is blind in his remaining eye.\nJane returns to Mr Rochester and offers to take care of him as his nurse or housekeepe\nMia Wasikowska ( VUSH-i-KOF-skə; born 25 October 1989) is an Australian actress. She made her screen debut on the Australian television drama All Saints in 2004, followed by her feature film debut in Suburban Mayhem (2006). She first became known to a wider audience following her critically acclaimed work on the HBO television series In Treatment (2008). She was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female for the film That Evening Sun (2009). \nWasikowska gained worldwide recognition in 2010 after starring as Alice in Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland and appearing in the comedy-drama film The Kids Are All Right. She starred in Cary Fukunaga's Jane Eyre (2011), Gus Van Sant's Restless (2011), Park Chan-wook's Stoker (2013), Jim Jarmusch's Only Lovers Left Alive (2013), John Curran's Tracks (2013), Richard Ayoade's The Double (2013), David Cronenberg's Maps to the Stars (2014), and Guillermo del Toro's Crimson Peak (2015). In 2016, she reprised her role as Alice in the film Alice Through the Looking Glass, and has since appeared in a number of independent films, including Damsel (2018), Judy and Punch (2019), and Bergman Island (2021).\n\n\n== Early life ==\nWasikowska was born on 25 October 1989 in Canberra, Australia. She attended Cook Primary School, Ainslie Primary School and Canberra High School, and Karabar High School in Queanbeyan, which neighbours Canberra. She has an older sister, Jess, and a younger brother, Kai. Her mother, Marzena Wasikowska, is a Polish photographer, while her father, John Reid, is an Australian photographer and collagist. In 1998, when she was eight years old, Wasikowska and her family moved to Szczecin, Poland for a year, after her mother received a grant to produce a collection of work based on her own experience of emigrating from Poland to Australia in 1974 at the age of 11. Wasikowska and her siblings took part in the production as subjects; she explained to Johanna Schneller of The Globe and Mail in July 2010, \"We never had to smile or perform. We weren't always conscious of being photographed. We'd just do our thing, and she'd take pictures of us.\"\nAt the age of nine, Wasikowska began studying ballet with Jackie Hallahan at the Canberra Dance Development Centre, with hopes of going professional. She began dancing en pointe at thirteen, and was training 35 hours a week in addition to attending school full-time. Her daily routine consisted of leaving school in the early afternoon and dancing until nine o'clock at night. A spur on her heel hampered her dancing. Her passion for ballet also waned due to the increasing pressure to achieve physical perfection and her growing dissatisfaction with that world in general, and she quit at the age of fourteen. However, she credits ballet with improving her ability to handle her nerves in auditions.\nAt the same time, she had been exposed to European and Australian cinema at an early age, and was particularly moved by Krzysztof Kieślowski's Three Colours trilogy and Gillian Armstrong's My Brilliant Career. Although shy and averse to performing during her school years, she was inspired to try to break into acting after seeing Holly Hunter in The Piano and Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence. She felt acting in film was a way to explore human imperfections. She looked up twelve Australian talent agencies on the Internet and contacted them all, but received only one response.

On leaving, Jane takes a position as governess to a girl named Adele at Thornfield Hall. Fully aware of her low rank and plain countenance, she makes the best of her situation. But Thornfield holds many secrets, and despite mysterious occurrences Jane cannot comprehend, she and Edward Rochester, owner of Thornfield and Adele's guardian, fall in love. Suddenly, when Jane is about to win the happiness she deserves, she discovers that Rochester is already married, that his wife is insane and has been living in accommodations in the attic.

Eventually, hero myth pattern studies were popularized by Joseph Campbell, who was influenced by Carl Jung's analytical psychology. Campbell used the monomyth to analyze and compare religions. In his book The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949), he describes the narrative pattern as follows:\n\nA hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.\nCampbell's theories regarding the concept of a \"monomyth\" have been the subject of criticism from scholars, particularly folklorists, who have dismissed the concept as a non-scholarly approach suffering from source-selection bias, among other criticisms. More recently, the hero's journey has been analyzed as an example of the sympathetic plot, a universal narrative structure in which a goal-directed protagonist confronts obstacles, overcomes them, and eventually reaps rewards.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe study of hero myth narratives can be traced back to 1871 with anthropologist Edward Burnett Tylor's observations of common patterns in the plots of heroes' journeys. In narratology and comparative mythology, others have proposed narrative patterns such as psychoanalyst Otto Rank in 1909 and amateur anthropologist Lord Raglan in 1936. Both Rank and Raglan have lists of cross-cultural traits often found in the accounts of mythical heroes and discuss hero narrative patterns in terms of Freudian psychoanalysis and ritualism.  According to Robert Segal, \"The theories of Rank, Campbell, and Raglan typify the array of analyses of hero myths.\"\n\n\n== Terminology ==\nCampbell borrowed the word monomyth from James Joyce's Finnegans Wake (1939). Campbell was a notable scholar of Joyce's work and in A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake (1944) co-authored the seminal analysis of Joyce's final novel. Campbell's singular the monomyth implies that the \"hero's journey\" is the ultimate narrative archetype, but the term monomyth has occasionally been used more generally, as a term for a mythological archetype or a supposed mytheme that re-occurs throughout the world's cultures. Omry Ronen referred to Vyacheslav Ivanov's treatment of Dionysus as an \"avatar of Christ\" (1904) as \"Ivanov's monomyth\".\nThe phrase \"the hero's journey\", used in reference to Campbell's monomyth, first entered into popular discourse through two documentaries. The first, released in 1987, The Hero's Journey: The World of Joseph Campbell, was accompanied by a 1990 companion book, The Hero's Journey: Joseph Campbell on His Life and Work (with Phil Cousineau and Stuart Brown, eds.). The second was Bill Moyers's series of seminal interviews with Campbell, released in 1988 as the documentary (and companion book) The Power of Myth. Cousineau in the introduction to the revised edition of The Hero's Journey wrote \"the monomyth is in effect a meta myth, a philosophical reading of the unity of mankind's spiritual history, the Story behind the story\".\n\n\n== Summary ==\nIn his book The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949), Campbell describes 17 stages of the monomyth. Not all monomyths necessarily contain all 17 stages explicitly; some myths may focus on only one of the stages, while others may deal with the stages in a somewhat different order. In the terminology of Claude Lévi-Strauss, the stages are the individual mythemes which are \"bundled\" or assembled into the structure of the monomyth.\nThe 17 stages may be organized in a number of ways, including division into three \"acts\" or s\nDaniel M. Lavery (born Mallory Ortberg, November 28, 1986) is an American author and editor. He is known for having co-founded the website The Toast, and written the books Texts from Jane Eyre (2014), The Merry Spinster (2018), Something That May Shock and Discredit You (2020), and Women's Hotel (2024). Lavery wrote Slate's \"Dear Prudence\" advice column from 2016 to 2021. From 2022 to 2023, he hosted a podcast on Slate titled Big Mood, Little Mood. In 2017, Lavery started a paid e-mail newsletter on Substack titled Shatner Chatner, renamed to The Chatner in 2021.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn Mallory Ortberg, Lavery grew up in northern Illinois and then San Francisco, one of three children of the evangelical Christian author and former Menlo Church pastor John Ortberg and Nancy Ortberg, who is also a pastor and the CEO of Transforming the Bay with Christ. Lavery attended Azusa Pacific University, a private, evangelical Christian university in California. While a student, Lavery appeared on Jeopardy! and finished in third place.\n\n\n== Writing ==\n\n\n=== Influences ===\nLavery has credited the work of Shirley Jackson and her novel We Have Always Lived in the Castle, in particular, and John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress as influential.\n\n\n=== Career overview ===\nLavery wrote for Gawker and The Hairpin. Through this work, he met Nicole Cliffe, with whom Lavery operated The Toast, a feminist general interest web site, from July 2013 to July 2016.\nLavery was included in the 2015 Forbes \"30 under 30\" list in the media category. On November 9, 2015, Slate announced that he would take over the magazine's \"Dear Prudence\" advice column from Emily Yoffe. Lavery stopped writing the column in May 2021.\nIn 2017, Lavery launched Shatner Chatner, a paid e-mail newsletter on Substack. On May 19, 2021, he accepted a Substack Pro deal and shortened the newsletter's name to The Chatner.\n\n\n=== Books ===\n\n\n==== Texts from Jane Eyre ====\nLavery's first book, Texts from Jane Eyre, was released in November 2014 and became a New York Times bestseller. The book was based on a column that he wrote first at The Hairpin, then continued at The Toast, which imagines well-known literary characters exchanging text messages. The premise was inspired by a comments section thread on a piece Cliffe had written for The Awl; on Cliffe's review of Gone With the Wind, a commentator wrote that his or her experience in the South was nearly identical to the novel \"except everybody has cell phones\". This prompted Lavery to imagine how Scarlett O'Hara might have used a cell phone.\n\n\n==== Rick and Morty Presents: Krombopulos Michael ====\nLavery's first comic one-shot, entitled Rick and Morty Presents: Krombopulos Michael, was published by Oni Press on June 20, 2018, following the Rick and Morty character of the same name.\n\n\n==== The Merry Spinster ====\nA short story collection, The Merry Spinster: Tales of Everyday Horror (Henry Holt, 2018), appeared in 2018. The book, Lavery's second release, was highly anticipated, with Publishers Weekly, Bustle, The A.V. Club and InStyle Australia included in their lists of forthcoming titles in 2018. The Merry Spinster reinvents fairy tales such as Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast; in the Los Angeles Times, Agatha French described his renderings as making the \"stories both weirder and yet somehow more familiar\".\n\n\n==== Something That May Shock and Discredit You ====\n\nLavery's third book, a memoir entitled Something That May Shock and Discredit You, was published in February 2020 by Simon & Schuster. It was originally published as individual essays.\n\n\n==== Women's Hotel ====\nLavery's fourth book, a novel entitled Women's Hotel, was published in October 2024 by HarperVia.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nLavery identifies as queer. In February 2018, he spoke to Autostraddle about the process of gender transitioning while writing The Merry Spinster. The following month, Lavery was interviewed by Heather Havrilesky in New York magazine's The Cut about coming\nThe Eyre Affair is the debut novel by English author Jasper Fforde, published by Hodder and Stoughton in 2001. It takes place in an alternative 1985, where literary detective Thursday Next pursues a master criminal through the world of Charlotte Brontë's 1847 novel Jane Eyre. Fforde had received 76 rejections for earlier works before being accepted by a publisher. Critical reception of this novel was generally positive, remarking on its originality.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nIn a parallel universe, England and Imperial Russia have fought the Crimean War for more than a century; although now a republic (with entertainer George Formby as its president), England still also  has a parliamentary government, although heavily influenced by the Goliath Corporation (a powerful weapon-producing company with questionable morals); and Wales is a separate, socialist nation. The book's fictional version of Jane Eyre ends with Jane accompanying her cousin, St. John Rivers, to India in order to help him with his missionary work. Society publicly debates literary questions (especially the question of Shakespearean authorship), sometimes inspiring gang wars and murder. Regular law enforcement agencies still exist, alongside new specialized agencies under the single organization SpecOps (Special Operations). The more than 20 branches include SpecOps 12, the Chronoguard, who police all events related to time travel, and SpecOps 27, the Literary Detectives, or \"LiteraTecs\", who deal with all literature-related crimes.\nThe Crimean War is a cold conflict with both sides at a stalemate but too stubborn to call for peace. A peace movement in Britain is gaining popularity. Meanwhile, Goliath has been contracted to create a plasma rifle codenamed \"STONK\" to overpower the Russians. The weapon should be capable of destroying a tank with a single blast. Goliath promises that STONK will soon be standard issue to the British military.\nThe plot revolves around Thursday Next, a single, thirty-six-year-old woman who is a veteran of the Crimean War and a literary detective who lives in London with her pet dodo Pickwick. (Dodos have been recreated, as have Neanderthals, due to advanced genetic engineering technology on this alternate Earth).  She is privately against the continuation of the war, as her brother was killed in action and her then fiancé Landen Parke-Laine lost a leg in combat. The trauma of the war led to the end of her relationship with Parke-Laine several years prior.\nAs the story begins, Thursday is promoted to assist in the capture of a wanted terrorist, Acheron Hades, her former university professor who has become a mysterious criminal mastermind. Thursday is the only living person who can recognize him, and nearly captures him during a stakeout, but Hades possesses several superhuman abilities, such as mental manipulation and extreme durability, and uses those powers to withstand her gunfire. He evades capture and kills Thursday's entire team. During the capture attempt she is shot, but a copy of Jane Eyre stops Hades's bullet. A mysterious stranger aids her until the paramedics arrive, leaving behind a handkerchief monogrammed with the letters \"E.F.R.\" and a 19th-century style jacket. Next recognizes these items as belonging to Edward Fairfax Rochester, a fictional character from Jane Eyre. During a flashback to her childhood, Thursday remembers a seemingly supernatural event, whereby she was able to physically enter the world of the novel and briefly became acquainted with Rochester.\nWhile recovering in hospital, she learns that, after fleeing the scene, Hades was seemingly killed in a car accident. She also meets a time-traveling future version of herself, who warns her that Hades survived the accident, and instructs her to take a LiteraTec job in her home town of Swindon. She takes the job, and while visiting her family there, she discovers that her brilliant Uncle Mycroft and Aunt Polly have created the Prose Portal, a device that allows peopl\nAnnabel Scholey (born 1983 or 1984) is an English actress.

These three sisters and their brother, Branwell (1817–1848), who had been born after Charlotte and before Emily, were very close to each other. As children, they developed their imaginations first through oral storytelling and play, set in an intricate imaginary world, and then through the collaborative writing of increasingly complex stories set in their fictional world.

The version Ó Proinntigh, which was first given by Patrick Woulfe in his Sloinnte Gaedheal is Gall (transl. Surnames of the Gael and the Foreigner) and reproduced without question by Edward MacLysaght, cannot be accepted as correct, as there were a number of well-known scribes with this name writing in Irish in the 17th and 18th centuries and all of them used the spelling Ó Pronntaigh. The name is derived from the word pronntach or bronntach, which is related to the word bronnadh, meaning \"giving\" or \"bestowal\" (pronn is given as an Ulster version of bronn in O'Reilly's Irish English Dictionary.)

Multiple theories exist to account for the change, including that he may have wished to hide his humble origins. As a man of letters, he would have been familiar with classical Greek and may have chosen the name after the Greek βροντή (transl. thunder). One view, which biographer C. K. Shorter proposed in 1896, is that he adapted his name to associate himself with Admiral Horatio Nelson, who was also Duke of Bronte. One might also find evidence for this theory in Patrick Brontë's desire to associate himself with the Duke of Wellington in his form of dress."

Marla Schaffel, who played the title character, won a Drama Desk Award and the Outer Critics Circle Award (in a tie with Christine Ebersole) for her performance. The production was directed by John Caird and Scott Schwartz, choreography by Jayne Paterson, set designer by John Napier, costumes by Andreane Neofitou, and lighting by Jules Fisher and Peggy Eisenhauer. Days after the Tony Award nominations were announced, a closing date of May 20 was announced. Alanis Morissette, a friend of Paul Gordon's, bought $150,000 worth of tickets to the musical and donated them to various charity groups.

Campbell's singular the monomyth implies that the \"hero's journey\" is the ultimate narrative archetype, but the term monomyth has occasionally been used more generally, as a term for a mythological archetype or a supposed mytheme that re-occurs throughout the world's cultures.

        "content": "New York City, the most populous city in the United States, is home to more than 7,000 completed high-rise buildings of at least 115 feet (35 m), of which at least 102 are taller than 650 feet (198 m). The tallest building in New York is One World Trade Center, which rises 1,776 feet (541 m). The 104-story skyscraper also stands as the tallest building in the United States, the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, and the seventh-tallest building in the world. At 1,550 feet (472 m), Central Park Tower is the second-tallest completed building in the city. It has the highest roof of any building outside Asia, and is the tallest residential building in the world. The third-tallest completed building in the city is 111 West 57th Street. Rising to 1,428 feet (435 m), it is the world's most slender skyscraper. The fourth-tallest is One Vanderbilt. At 1,401 feet (427 m), it is the tallest office building in Midtown. The fifth-tallest is 432 Park Avenue at 1,397 feet (426 m).\nAt 1,250 feet (381 m), the 102-story Empire State Building in Midtown Manhattan, which was finished in 1931, stood as the tallest building in the world from its completion until 1970, when construction on the 1,368-foot (417 m) North Tower of the original World Trade Center surpassed it. It is the tenth-tallest building in the United States, and rises to a pinnacle of 1,454 feet (443 m) including its antenna. The North Tower (the original One World Trade Center), along with its twin the South Tower (the first Two World Trade Center), which was six feet shorter, held this title only briefly as they were both surpassed by construction of the 110-story Willis Tower in Chicago in 1973. The Twin Towers remained the tallest buildings in New York City until they were destroyed in 2001 during the September 11 attacks, leaving the Empire State Building again as the city's tallest building.\nThe new One World Trade Center began construction in 2006; in April 2012 it surpassed the Empire State Building to become the city's tallest. Upon its topping out in May 2013, the 1,776-foot (541 m) One World Trade Center surpassed the Willis Tower to become the tallest building in the United States and the Western Hemisphere. One World Trade Center is part of the redevelopment of the World Trade Center, which also includes the 1,079-foot (329 m) 3 World Trade Center, the 977-foot (298 m) 4 World Trade Center, the 743-foot (226 m) 7 World Trade Center, the approved 900-foot (274 m) 5 World Trade Center, and one partly constructed on-hold building: the 1,350-foot (411 m) 2 World Trade Center.\nThe majority of skyscrapers in New York City are concentrated in Midtown and Downtown Manhattan, although other neighborhoods of Manhattan and the boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx also contain some high-rises.\nAs of March 2024, there were 317 completed skyscrapers that rose at least 492 feet (150 m) in height, more than any other city in the Western Hemisphere, and third most in the world exceeded only by Hong Kong and Shenzhen.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of skyscrapers in New York City began with the construction of the Equitable Life, Western Union, and Tribune buildings in the early 1870s. These relatively short early skyscrapers, sometimes referred to as \"preskyscrapers\" or \"protoskyscrapers\", included features such as a steel frame and elevators—then-new innovations that were used in the city's later skyscrapers.: 62  Modern skyscraper construction began with the completion of the World Building in 1890; the structure rose to a pinnacle of 349 feet (106 m). Though not the city's first high-rise, it was the first building to surpass the 284-foot (87 m) spire of Trinity Church. The World Building, which stood as the tallest in the city until 1899, was demolished in 1955 to allow for the construction of an expanded entrance to the Brooklyn Bridge. The Park Row Building, at 391 feet (119 m), was the city's tallest building from 1899 to 1908, and the world's tallest office buildin\nThis list of tallest buildings in Rochester ranks high-rise buildings in the U.S. city of Rochester, New York by height. The tallest building in the city is Innovation Square, formerly known as the Xerox Tower, which rises 443 feet (135 m) and was completed in 1968.\n\n\n== Tallest buildings ==\nThis lists ranks Rochester skyscrapers that stand at least 200 feet (61 m) tall, based on standard height measurement. This includes spires and architectural details but does not include antenna masts. Existing structures are included for ranking purposes based on present height.\n\n\n== Tallest proposed, approved, under construction, and/or cancelled ==\nThis lists buildings that are under construction, approved for construction or proposed for construction in Rochester and are planned to rise at least 250 feet (76 m), but are not yet completed structures. Under construction buildings that have already been topped out are also included.\nThe demolition of Midtown Plaza was completed in 2011. Paetec was bought by Windstream and they housed their regional offices in a renovated 3 story portion of the former Seneca Building, rather than build a new tower. \n\n\n== Timeline of tallest buildings ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\nA. ^ New York has 206 existing and under construction buildings over 500 feet (152 m), Chicago has 107, Miami has 37, Houston has 30, Los Angeles has 22, Dallas has 19, Atlanta has 19, San Francisco has 18, Las Vegas has 17, Boston has 16, Seattle has 14, Philadelphia has 10, Pittsburgh has 10, Jersey City has 9, Minneapolis has 9, Denver has 8, Detroit has 7, Charlotte has 6 and Columbus has 5.

The tallest building in New York State is the 104-story One World Trade Center, which was completed in 2014 and rises to 1,776 feet (541 m) in Lower Manhattan, New York City. New York City, the largest city in the United States, is home to the vast majority of the skyscrapers in New York; outside the city, most of the state's skyscrapers are concentrated in Albany, Buffalo and Rochester. The tallest building in Upstate New York is the 44-story Erastus Corning Tower, which rises 589 feet (180 m) in Albany, the state's capital city. Although the building is the tallest in the upstate region by a significant margin, it does not appear in the 100-tallest buildings in New York state when New York City skyscrapers are included in the ranking.\n\n\n== Tallest buildings ==\n\nThis list ranks completed skyscrapers in Upstate New York that stand at least 290 feet (88 m) tall, based on standard height measurement.

Since then, the United States has been home to some of the world's tallest skyscrapers. New York City, and especially the borough of Manhattan, has the tallest skyline in the country. Eleven American buildings have held the title of tallest building in the world. New York City and Chicago have been the centers of American skyscraper building. The 10-story Home Insurance Building, built in Chicago in 1885, is regarded as the world's first skyscraper; the building was constructed using a novel steel-loadbearing frame which became a standard of the industry worldwide.\nSince its topping out in 2013, One World Trade Center in New York City has been the tallest skyscraper in the United States. Its spire brings the structure to a symbolic architectural height of 1,776 feet (541 m), connoting the year the Declaration of Independence was signed, though the absolute tip (or pinnacle) of the structure is measured at 1,792 ft (546 m). However, the observation deck elevation and the height to the highest occupied floor of One World Trade Center are surpassed by Central Park Tower, 432 Park Avenue, 111 West 57th Street, and Chicago's Willis Tower, which was formerly and is still commonly known as Sears Tower. Tribune East Tower in Chicago will also have a higher occupied floor and roof upon its completion.\nPrior to the September 11 attacks in New York City, the twin towers of the first World Trade Center occupied the second and third positions on the list below. The North Tower (1 WTC) stood at 1,368 feet (417 m), while the South Tower (2 WTC) was 1,362 feet (415 m) tall, then surpassed only by the Willis Tower at 1,450 feet (442 m). If they were still standing today, they would occupy the seventh and eighth positions on the list below, with their replacement—the new One World Trade Center—being excluded.\nThere are numerous skyscrapers and supertall buildings both proposed and under construction throughout the country, concentrated in Chicago and New York City. 270 Park Avenue, in New York City, is currently under construction. In Chicago, work for Tribune East Tower has not begun but tentatively planned to start in February 2024. Other tall buildings that are proposed include the 1,907-foot-tall (581 m) Legends Tower in Oklahoma City, the 1,010-foot-tall (310 m) One Bayfront Plaza, and the 1,049-foot-tall (320 m) One Brickell Centre in Miami.\n\n\n== Tallest buildings ==\nThis list ranks completed and topped-out buildings in the United States that stand at least 800 feet (244 m) tall, based on standard height measurement which includes spires and architectural details, but excludes antenna masts.

The tallest building in Jersey City is the 79-story 99 Hudson Street, which topped out at 900 feet (274 m) in September 2018. It is currently the tallest building in New Jersey and 51st-tallest building in the United States. The 42-story 30 Hudson Street, known widely as the \"Goldman Sachs Tower\", which rises 781 feet (238 m) and was completed in 2004, is the second-tallest building in New Jersey and 99th-tallest building in the United States. The third-tallest skyscraper in Jersey City is the 70-story Journal Squared Tower 2 at 754 feet (230 m). Nine of the ten tallest buildings in New Jersey are located in Jersey City. Jersey City has the 10th-largest skyline in the United States.\nThe history of skyscrapers in Jersey City began with the 1928 completion of Labor Bank Building, which is often regarded as the first skyscraper in the city; it rises 15 floors and 179 feet (55 m) in height. The building, now known as \"26 Journal Square\", was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Jersey City went through a relatively small building boom in the late 1980s and early 1990s and then entered a larger period of commercial and residential high-rise construction in the late 1990s. This second boom has resulted in the construction of many of the city's tallest buildings, including 30 Hudson Street and the Harborside Financial Center development. The construction boom has continued to the present. Since 2002, the city has seen consistent growth in the number of new buildings that are 410 feet (125 m) or higher. As of February 2022, there are 122 completed high-rises in the city. Thirty completed buildings stand at least 410 feet (125 m) in height.\nIn addition, Jersey City's skyline is ranked (based on completed buildings over 492 feet (150 m) tall as of September 2024) first in New Jersey with 19 buildings, third in the Northeast (after New York City, and Boston), 10th in the United States, 13th in North America, and 82nd in the world.[A]\n\n\n== Tallest buildings ==\nThis list ranks Jersey City skyscrapers that stand at least 410 feet (125 m) tall, based on standard height measurement.

The tallest building in New Jersey is the 79-story 99 Hudson Street in Jersey City, which topped out at 900 feet (274 m) in September 2018. It is the 51st-tallest building in the United States, as well as the 15th tallest residential building in the United States. The 42-story 30 Hudson Street, known widely as the Goldman Sachs Tower, which rises 781 feet (238 m) at Exchange Place in Jersey City is the state's tallest commercial building. It is also the 97th-tallest building in the United States. The tallest building in New Jersey outside Jersey City is the 57-story Ocean Resort Casino, which rises 709 feet (216 m) in Atlantic City and ranks as the second-tallest casino tower in the United States.\nThe vast majority of skyscrapers and high-rises in New Jersey are concentrated in Jersey City, Newark, Atlantic City, Fort Lee, and North Hudson. Amongst New Jersey cities, Jersey City has the most buildings exceeding 330 feet (100 m) in height at 36 buildings, followed by Atlantic City with 11 buildings, Newark with 9 buildings, and Fort Lee with 7 buildings. \nThe first skyscraper in New Jersey was the Firemen's Insurance Building, built in 1910 in Newark. The first skyscraper boom in New Jersey largely began in the 1920s and 1930s, largely concentrated in Newark, with construction of various iconic buildings such as the National Newark Building and the Military Park Building. Newark had a small high-rise building boom in the 1960s to 1970s, followed by decades of little construction. Although Jersey City's first skyscraper, the Labor Bank Building, was built in 1928, the city did not have much of a skyline presence until a small building boom in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the 2000s, Jersey City's building boom truly kicked off. Jersey City and Newark have experienced large building booms in the 2010s, particularly toward the end of the decade, both of which have continued into the present. Atlantic City had two distinct building booms, first in the 1980s and again in the 2000s, largely the construction of casino buildings.\n\n\n== Tallest buildings ==\nThis list ranks New Jersey skyscrapers that stand at least 330 feet (100 m) tall, based on standard height measurement.

The tallest building in Buffalo is currently the Seneca One Tower, which stands 529 feet (161 m) tall. As of 2017, Buffalo has 17 structures taller than 250 ft (76 m).\nBuffalo has a rich tradition for architecture. Among the first true skyscrapers built in the city were the Prudential (Guaranty) Building and the Ellicott Square Building, both being built in the 1890s. A number of the tallest municipal buildings in the country were also built in the city, such as Buffalo City Hall, which continues to dominate the skyline. The city is also home to a large collection of large grain elevators, many of which rise above 150 ft (46 m). Construction of high rise buildings has increased in recent years after decades of relative dormancy, in addition to the retro-fitting of many old structures.\n\n\n== Tallest buildings ==\nThis lists ranks Buffalo buildings that stand at least 128 feet (39 m) tall, based on standard height measurement.

Tall buildings, such as skyscrapers, are intended here as enclosed structures with continuously occupiable floors and a height of at least 350 metres (1,150 ft). Such definition excludes non-building structures, such as towers.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHistorically, the world's tallest man-made structure was the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, which held the position for over 3800 years until the construction of Lincoln Cathedral in 1311. The Strasbourg Cathedral in France, completed in 1439, was the world's tallest building until 1874.\n\n  \nThe first building considered to be a skyscraper was the 138 ft (42.1 m) Home Insurance Building, built in Chicago in 1885. The United States would remain the location of the world's tallest building throughout the 20th century until 1998, when the Petronas Towers were completed. Since then, two other buildings have gained the title: Taipei 101 in 2004 and Burj Khalifa in 2010. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the Middle East, China, and Southeast Asia have experienced booms in skyscraper construction.\n\n\n== Ranking criteria and alternatives ==\nThe international non-profit organization Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) was formed in 1969 and announces the title of \"The World's Tallest Building\" and sets the standards by which buildings are measured. It maintains a list of the 100 tallest completed buildings in the world. The organization currently ranks Burj Khalifa in Dubai as the tallest at 828 m (2,717 ft). However, the CTBUH only recognizes buildings that are complete, and some buildings included within the lists in this article are not considered finished by the CTBUH.\nIn 1996, as a response to the dispute as to whether the Petronas Towers or the Sears Tower was taller, the council listed and ranked buildings in four categories:\n\nheight to structural or architectural top;\nheight to floor of highest occupied floor;\nheight to top of roof (removed as category in November 2009); and\nheight to top of any part of the building.\nAll categories measure the building from the level of the lowest significant open-air pedestrian entrance.\nSpires are considered integral parts of the architectural design of buildings, changes to which would substantially change the appearance and design of the building, whereas antennas may be added or removed without such consequences. The Petronas Towers, with their spires, are thus ranked higher than the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) with its antennas, despite the Petronas Towers' lower roofs and lower highest point.\nUntil 1996, the world's tallest building was defined by the height to the top of the tallest architectural element, including spires but not antennae. In 1930, this definitional argument led to a rivalry between the Bank of Manhattan Building and the Chrysler Building. The Bank of Manhattan Building (i.e. 40 Wall Street) employed only a short spire, was 282.5 m (927 ft) tall, and had a much higher top occupied floor (the second category in the 1996 criteria for tallest building). In contrast, the Chrysler Building employed a very large 38.1 m (125 ft) spire secretly assembled inside the building to claim the title of world's tallest building with a total height of 318.9 m (1,046 ft), although it had a lower top occupied floor and a shorter height when both buildings' spires were excluded.\nUpset by Chrysler's victory, Shreve & Lamb, the consulting architects of the Bank of Manhattan Building, wrote a newspaper article claiming that their building was actually the tallest, since it contained the world's highest usable floor, at 255 m (837 ft). They pointed out that the observation deck in the Bank of Manhattan Building was nearly 30 m (98 ft) above the top floor in the Chrysler Building, whose surpassing spire was strictly ornamental and inaccessible.\nThe Burj Khalifa currently tops the list regardless of which criterion is applied, though at a much lower margin when measured to highest\nLists of tallest buildings in New York include:\n\nList of tallest buildings in New York City\nList of tallest buildings in Brooklyn\nList of tallest buildings in Queens\nList of tallest buildings in Upstate New York\nList of tallest buildings in Albany, New York\nList of tallest buildings in Buffalo, New York\nList of tallest buildings in Rochester, New York\nList of tallest buildings in Syracuse, New York\nList of tallest buildings on Long Island\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of tallest buildings in the United States\nThis list of the tallest buildings in North America ranks skyscrapers in order by height.

Since then, the United States has been home to some of the world's tallest skyscrapers, with the tallest in New York City and Chicago. Eleven buildings in North America have held the title of tallest building in the world, with 9 in New York City.

The building gained the official title of \"tallest building in the world\" and the tallest self-supported structure at its opening on January 9, 2010. The second-tallest structure in the world is the 679-metre-tall (2,227 ft) Merdeka 118 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, while the third-tallest self-supporting structure and the tallest tower in the world is the Tokyo Skytree (634 m or 2,080 ft). The tallest guyed structure is the KRDK-TV mast in North Dakota, U.S. at 630 metres (2,060 ft).\nThe Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, an organization that certifies buildings as the \"World's Tallest\", recognizes a building only if at least 50% of its height is made up of floor plates containing habitable floor area. Structures that do not meet this criterion, such as the CN Tower, are defined as \"towers\".\nThere are dozens of radio and television broadcasting towers which measure over 600 metres (about 2,000 ft) in height, and only the tallest are recorded in publicly available information sources.\n\n\n== Debate over definition ==\nThe assessment of the height of artificial structures has been controversial. Because varying standards have been used by different organizations, the accepted height of these structures or buildings depends on which standards are accepted. The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat has changed its definitions over time. Some of the controversy regarding the definitions and assessment of tall structures and buildings has included the following:\n\nthe definition of a structure, a building and a tower\nwhether a structure, building or tower under construction should be included in any assessment\nwhether a structure, building or tower has to be officially opened before it is assessed\nwhether structures built in and rising above water should have their below-water height included in any assessment.\nwhether a structure, building or tower that is guyed is assessed in the same category as self-supporting structures.\nWithin an accepted definition of a building further controversy has included the following factors:\n\nwhether only habitable height of the building is considered\nwhether communication towers with observation galleries should be considered \"habitable\" in this sense\nwhether rooftop antennas, viewing platforms or any other architecture that does not form a habitable floor should be included in the assessment\nwhether a floor built at a high level of a telecommunications or viewing tower should change the tower's definition to that of a \"building\"\n\n\n== Tallest structures ==\n\nThis category does not require the structure to be \"officially\" open, but does require it to be \"topped out\".\nThe tallest artificial structure is Burj Khalifa, a skyscraper in Dubai that reached 829.8 m (2,722 ft) in height on January 17, 2009. By April 8, 2008 it had been built higher than the KVLY-TV mast in North Dakota, US. That September it officially surpassed Poland's 646.38 m (2,120.7 ft) Warsaw radio mast, which stood from 1974 to 1991, to become the tallest structure ever built. Guyed lattice towers such as these masts had held the world height record since 1954. \nThe Petronius Platform stands 610 m (2,000 ft) off the sea floor, leading some, including Guinness World Records 2007, to claim it as the tallest freestanding structure in the world, until surpassed by the Burj Khalifa in 2010. However, it is debated whether underwater height should be counted, in the same manner as height below ground is ignored on buildings. The Troll A platform is 472 m (1,549 ft), without any part of that height being supported by wires. The tension-leg type of oil platform has even greater below-water heights with several examples more than 1,000 m (3,300 ft) deep. However, these platforms are not considered constant structures as the vast majority of their height is made up of the length of the tendons attaching the floating pl\nThis list ranks buildings in the U.S. city of Syracuse, New York, by height.\nSince its construction in 1927, the State Tower Building has been the tallest building in Syracuse.\nBricks on the facade of the State Tower Building gradually get lighter towards the top of the Art Deco building; this was intended to make the building seem higher than it actually is. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing property in the Hanover Square Historic District. It was renovated in 2003 and 2016.\nSt. Paul's Episcopal Cathedral, one of the top 10, was constructed in the 1800s.\nEight tall buildings were constructed in the 1970s, and apparently demand for office space has not required new buildings since.   \n\n\n== Cancelled buildings ==\nProposed construction of the \"Primex Building\" never got past foundation work being done, in a project planned to be completed in 1964.  It was to have a revolving restaurant, and, at 25 stories, would have been the tallest building in New York State outside of New York City.\nOn October 24, 2002, the groundbreaking for a 430-foot (130 m), 47-story Destiny USA Hotel to be named the Grand Destiny Hotel was held. On that date a steel beam was driven into the Carousel Center parking lot. Over the next three weeks, over 40 more pilings were driven, but by December 2 construction had stopped. In July 2008 construction had restarted, and by August three stories of steel framework had been erected.\nOnCenter Convention Center Marriott Hotel was a planned 12- or 16-floor building, 58.28 metres (191.2 ft)] in 2004 and eventually cancelled.\nIn 2001 Clinton Square North Tower was a planned 16-floor, 74.49-metre (244.4 ft) complex built alongside Chase Tower and eventually cancelled.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Syracuse University buildings\nList of tallest buildings in Upstate New York\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBeauchamp, William Martin (1908).

Clarke Publishing Company.\nThe building form most closely associated with New York City is the skyscraper, which has shifted many commercial and residential districts from low-rise to high-rise. Surrounded mostly by water, the city has amassed one of the largest and most varied collection of skyscrapers in the world.\nNew York has architecturally significant buildings in a wide range of styles spanning distinct historical and cultural periods. These include the Woolworth Building (1913), an early Gothic revival skyscraper with large-scale gothic architectural detail. The 1916 Zoning Resolution required setback in new buildings, and restricted towers to a percentage of the lot size, to allow sunlight to reach the streets below. The Art Deco design of the Chrysler Building (1930) and Empire State Building (1931), with their tapered tops and steel spires, reflected the zoning requirements. The Chrysler Building is considered by many historians and architects to be one of New York's finest, with its distinctive ornamentation such as V-shaped lighting inserts capped by a steel spire at the tower's crown. Early influential examples of the International Style in the United States are 330 West 42nd Street (1931) and the Seagram Building (1958). The Condé Nast Building (2000) is an important example of green design in American skyscrapers.\nThe character of New York's large residential districts is often defined by the elegant brownstone rowhouses, townhouses, and tenements that were built during a period of rapid expansion from 1870 to 1930. In contrast, New York City also has neighborhoods that are less densely populated and feature free-standing dwellings. In the outer boroughs, large single-family homes are common in various architectural styles such as Tudor Revival and Victorian. Split two-family homes are also widely available across the outer boroughs, for example in the Flushing area.\nStone and brick became the city's building materials of choice after the construction of wood-frame houses was limited in the aftermath of the Great Fire of 1835. Unlike Paris, which for centuries was built from its own limestone bedrock, New York has always drawn its building stone from a far-flung network of quarries and its stone buildings have a variety of textures and hues. A distinctive feature of many of the city's buildings is the presence of wooden roof-mounted water towers. In the 19th century, the city required their installation on buildings higher than six stories to prevent the need for excessively high water pressures at lower elevations, which could burst municipal water pipes. Garden apartments became popular during the 1920s in outlying areas, including Jackson Heights in Queens, which became more accessible with expansion of the subway.\n\n\n== Concentrations of buildings ==\n\nNew York has two main concentrations of high-rise buildings: Midtown Manhattan and Lower Manhattan, each with its own uniquely recognizable skyline. Midtown Manhattan, the largest central business district in the world, is home to such notable buildings as the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, and Citigroup Center, as well as the Rockefeller Center complex. Lower Manhattan comprises the third largest central business district in the United States (after Midtown and Chicago's Loop). Lower Manhattan was characterized by the omnipresence of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center from its completion in 1973 until its destruction in the September 11 attacks in 2001.\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, Lower Manhattan saw reconstruction, which included One World Trade Center within the new World Trade Center complex. The Downtown skyline received new designs from such architects as Santiago Calatrava and Frank Gehry. In 2010, a 749-foot (228 m), 43-story tower named 200 West Street was built for Goldman Sachs across the street from the World Trade Center site.\nNew York City has a long history of tall buildings. It has been home to 10 buildings that have held the world's tal\nThe Chrysler Building is an Art Deco skyscraper on the East Side of Manhattan in New York City, at the intersection of 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. At 1,046 ft (319 m), it is the tallest brick building in the world with a steel framework. It was both the world's first supertall skyscraper and the world's tallest building for 11 months after its completion in 1930. As of 2019, the Chrysler is the 12th-tallest building in the city, tied with The New York Times Building.\nOriginally a project of real estate developer and former New York State Senator William H. Reynolds, the building was commissioned by Walter Chrysler, the head of the Chrysler Corporation. The construction of the Chrysler Building, an early skyscraper, was characterized by a competition with 40 Wall Street and the Empire State Building to become the world's tallest building. The Chrysler Building was designed and funded by Walter Chrysler personally as a real estate investment for his children, but it was not intended as the Chrysler Corporation's headquarters. An annex was completed in 1952, and the building was sold by the Chrysler family the next year, with numerous subsequent owners.\nWhen the Chrysler Building opened, there were mixed reviews of the building's design, some calling it inane and unoriginal, others hailing it as modernist and iconic. Reviewers in the late 20th and early 21st centuries regarded the building as a paragon of the Art Deco architectural style. In 2007, it was ranked ninth on the American Institute of Architects' list of America's Favorite Architecture. The facade and interior became New York City designated landmarks in 1978, and the structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark in 1976.\n\n\n== Site ==\nThe Chrysler Building is on the eastern side of Lexington Avenue between 42nd and 43rd streets in Midtown Manhattan in New York City. The land was donated to The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in 1902. The site is roughly a trapezoid with a 201-foot-long (61 m) frontage on Lexington Avenue; a 167-foot-long (51 m) frontage on 42nd Street; and a 205-foot-long (62 m) frontage on 43rd Street. The site bordered the old Boston Post Road, which predated, and ran aslant of, the Manhattan street grid established by the Commissioners' Plan of 1811. As a result, the east side of the building's base is similarly aslant. The building is assigned its own ZIP Code, 10174. It is one of 41 buildings in Manhattan that have their own ZIP Codes, as of 2019.\nThe Grand Hyatt New York hotel and the Graybar Building are across Lexington Avenue, while the Socony–Mobil Building is across 42nd Street. In addition, the Chanin Building is to the southwest, diagonally across Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe Chrysler Building was designed by William Van Alen in the Art Deco style and is named after one of its original tenants, automotive executive Walter Chrysler. With a height of 1,046 feet (319 m), the Chrysler is the 12th-tallest building in the city as of 2019, tied with The New York Times Building. The building is constructed of a steel frame infilled with masonry, with areas of decorative metal cladding. The structure contains 3,862 exterior windows. Approximately fifty metal ornaments protrude at the building's corners on five floors reminiscent of gargoyles on Gothic cathedrals. The 31st-floor contains gargoyles as well as replicas of the 1929 Chrysler radiator caps, and the 61st-floor is adorned with eagles as a nod to America's national bird.\nThe design of the Chrysler Building makes extensive use of bright \"Nirosta\" stainless steel, an austenitic alloy developed in Germany by Krupp. It was the first use of this \"18-8 stainless steel\" in an American project, composed of 18% chromium and 8% nickel. Nirosta was used in the exterior ornaments, the window frames, the crown, and the needle. The steel was an integral part of Van Alen's design,\nThis list of tallest church buildings ranks church buildings by height. From the Middle Ages until the advent of the skyscraper, Christian church buildings were often the world's tallest buildings. From 1311, when the spire of Lincoln Cathedral surpassed the height of the Great Pyramid of Giza, until the Washington Monument was completed in 1884, a succession of church buildings held this title.\n\nThe tallest church building in the world is the Ulm Minster (161.5 m), the main Lutheran congregation in Ulm, Germany.\nThe tallest Catholic, as well as the tallest domed church building, is the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace (158 m) in Yamoussoukro, Ivory Coast.\nThe tallest church building with two steeples as well as the tallest cathedral is Cologne Cathedral (157.4 m) in Cologne, Germany.\nThe tallest Eastern Orthodox, as well as the tallest domed cathedral, will be People's Salvation Cathedral (now 120 m; 127 m when completed) in Bucharest, Romania.\nThe tallest brickwork church building is St Martin's Church (130.6 m) in Landshut, Germany.\nThe tallest brickwork church building with two steeples is St Mary's Church (125 m) in Lübeck, Germany.\nThe tallest wooden church building is Săpânța-Peri Monastery church (78 m) in Săpânța, Romania.\nThe tallest church building in the Americas is the Cathedral of Maringá (124 m) in Maringá, Brazil.\nIf completed, the Sagrada Família in Barcelona, Spain, will be the tallest church building in the world, at 172.5 metres (566 ft).\nThe cities with the most churches surpassing 99 metres (325 feet) are Hamburg (5 of the 29 tallest churches, with 5 towers overall), Lübeck (4 of the 56 tallest churches, two of which with twin towers → 6 towers overall), Vienna (2), Tallinn (2), St. Petersburg (2), New York City (2), Dortmund (2) and Stralsund (2).\nThe cities with the most churches surpassing 75 metres (246 feet) are Berlin (16), Hamburg (9), Paris (8), Dresden (8), Vienna (7), Stockholm (7) and Munich (7), while in the Americas it is New York City (4).\n\n\n== Constructed ==\n\n\n=== Church buildings ≥ 99 m (325 ft) ===\nThis list does not include church buildings that incorporate a significant portion of space to non-church uses, such as the Chicago Temple Building.

The Brooklyn Tower, a condominium and rental tower in the Downtown neighborhood of the borough, is Brooklyn's tallest building at 1,066 feet (325 m) following its topping out in October 2021. The Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower in Fort Greene, at 512 feet (156 m), was the tallest building in Brooklyn for 80 years from its completion in 1929 until 2009, when The Brooklyner was topped out at 514 feet (157 m).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe construction of high-rise buildings in Brooklyn began during the late 19th century, following the completion of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1883 and the building of elevated railroads and streetcar lines during the late 1880s. Increased accessibility to Downtown Brooklyn brought greater economic growth and propagated denser commercial development, which increased the heights of downtown buildings throughout the 1890s. This led to the 1891 construction of Brooklyn's first skyscraper, the 10-story Franklin Trust Company Building. By 1901, the 13-story Temple Bar Building was completed and was the borough's first steel-beam high-rise, its largest office building, and its tallest at 164 feet (50 m). In the early 20th-century, the opening of multiple New York City Subway lines in Downtown Brooklyn spurred further development of tall commercial buildings. The Zoning Resolution of 1916, which required buildings to incorporate setbacks from the street to allow for sunlight, influenced the construction of taller, more slender buildings.\nIn 1918, the 22-story and 220-foot (67 m) building at 32 Court Street was completed and regarded as Brooklyn's first \"true skyscraper\", and thus initiated a skyscraper building boom in Brooklyn centered on Court and Montague Streets. Brooklyn's high-rise development continued unabated into the 1920s. The Court and Remsen Building, built in 1926 at 350 feet (107 m) in height, was the first of the major high-rises to be built in Brooklyn during the 1920s and briefly held the title of Brooklyn's tallest building until 1927, when the Montague–Court Building was completed and became Brooklyn's tallest building at 462 feet (141 m). Brooklyn's skyscraper building boom ceased during the Great Depression, and the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower in Fort Greene, which was completed in 1929, remained Brooklyn's tallest building until 2009.\nIn 2004, several portions of Downtown Brooklyn were rezoned to promote more commercial, residential, and retail development. This rezoning allowed for greater density of development, and combined with an increased demand for housing, these areas experienced a boom in the construction of tall buildings. In addition to Downtown Brooklyn, high-rise buildings are also concentrated in the Brooklyn Heights, Fort Greene, and Williamsburg neighborhoods, although other Brooklyn neighborhoods have significant numbers of high-rises. In 2019, One South First, situated on the Domino Park waterfront, became Williamsburg's tallest tower at 435 feet. The Brooklyn Tower which rises to a height of 1,066 feet in Downtown Brooklyn, became the tallest building in the New York City area outside of Manhattan, and the tallest building on Long Island.\n\n\n== Tallest buildings ==\nThere are over 60 completed or topped out skyscrapers in Brooklyn that stand at least 350 feet (107 m) tall, based on standard height measurement which includes spires and architectural details but does not include antenna masts.

Designed by the firm of Foster + Partners, the skyscraper is expected to rise 1,388 feet (423 m) when completed in 2025.\n\nThe tower replaces the 52-story Union Carbide Building, built in 1960 and demolished in 2021. The old structure was the headquarters of JPMorgan Chase, which is using 383 Madison Avenue until it can move into the new building. Before that, the old building was originally the headquarters of Union Carbide.\n\n\n== Site ==\nLocated in New York City's Midtown Manhattan neighborhood, 270 Park Avenue will occupy the entire city block bounded by Madison Avenue to the west, 48th Street to the north, Park Avenue to the east, and 47th Street to the south. The lot measures about 80,000 square feet (7,400 m2) with a frontage of 200 feet (61 m) on each avenue and 400 feet (120 m) on each street.\nThe lot is part of Terminal City, the area that developed rapidly after the 1913 completion of the largely underground Grand Central Terminal. The buildings erected in the following years included office buildings such as the Chanin Building, Bowery Savings Bank Building, and New York Central Building, and hotels such as the Biltmore, Commodore, Waldorf Astoria, and Summit. The site of the future 270 Park Avenue was occupied by a six-building complex, the Hotel Marguery, which opened in 1917 and was developed by Charles V. Paterno. The stone-clad hotel was 12 stories high and designed in the Renaissance Revival style. By 1920, the area had become what The New York Times called \"a great civic centre\".\nThe Hotel Marguery was replaced by the 52-story Union Carbide Building, the first structure to occupy the entire block, which opened in 1960. The building eventually became JPMorgan Chase's world headquarters. Among the site's current neighbors are the old New York Mercantile Library and 400 Madison Avenue to the west; Tower 49 to the northwest; 277 Park Avenue to the east; 245 Park Avenue to the southeast; and 383 Madison Avenue to the south.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nFoster and Partners designed the building, which will be 1,388 feet (423 m) tall. Sources disagree on the number of stories. The New York Times indicates that the building will rise 70 stories, Emporis cited a figure of 63 stories, and the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat gives a figure of 60 stories. There are 24 massive columns at the base, which will support a lobby measuring about 80 feet (24 m) high, with public space facing Madison and Park Avenues. Above the lobby will be a series of setbacks to the west and east, tapering to a pinnacle.\nThe interior will fit 15,000 employees and will contain a food hall, a penthouse conference center, a fitness center, and large spaces illuminated by natural lights. The floor plates will be able to be configured in several layouts. To comply with city legislation, which bans the use of natural gas in all new buildings constructed after 2027, the structure will be powered entirely by hydroelectric energy. Ninety-seven percent of materials from the old building were creatively reused, recycled, or otherwise diverted from landfills.\nThe design team also includes Adamson Associates as architect of record; Jaros, Baum & Bolles as MEP engineer; and Severud Associates as structural engineer.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Planning ===\nIn February 2018, JPMorgan announced it would demolish the former Union Carbide Building to make way for a structure that was almost twice as tall. This was the first major project to be announced as part of the Midtown East rezoning in the 2010s. The former building became the tallest voluntarily demolished building in the world, overtaking the previous record-holder Singer Building that was demolished in 1968.  The replacement 1,388-foot (423 m), 70-story headquarters would have space for 15,000 employees.

In the city, 25 buildings stand 200 feet (61 m) and taller. The tallest building in Oklahoma City, and in Oklahoma, is the 50-story Devon Tower, which rises 844 feet (257 m) above the central business district. Other notable skyscrapers are Chase Tower and First National Center, which stand as the second and third-tallest buildings in Oklahoma City, respectively. Five of the 10 tallest buildings in Oklahoma are located in Oklahoma City.\nThe history of skyscrapers in Oklahoma City began with the completion of the Colcord Hotel, Oklahoma City's first skyscraper. After oil was discovered in the area, the population of Oklahoma City grew significantly. As a result, the city's skyline expanded, which featured a \"race to the top\" with the synchronous construction of First National Center and City Place Tower in the central business district. Contemporary skyscrapers began to be built in the north and west sides of Oklahoma City, and later in the downtown area. In 1993, Oklahoma City voters approved the MAPS (Metropolitan Area Projects) program, which featured the construction of several  distinct domestic facilities and restorations and expansions of other older ones. It was completed in 2004 and is deemed to be the first program of its kind for a city the size of Oklahoma City.\nThe Devon Tower, which was completed in 2012, has overtaken the Chase Tower as the tallest building in Oklahoma City with a height of 844 feet (257 m). It has also become the tallest building in the state of Oklahoma, surpassing the BOK Tower in Tulsa.

The title of \"world's tallest building\" has been held  by various buildings in modern times, including Lincoln Cathedral in Lincoln, England, and the Empire State Building and the original World Trade Center, both in New York City.\nBefore the modern skyscraper era emerged, between c. 1311 and 1884 the tallest buildings and structures were mostly Christian churches and cathedrals. Prior to then, the tallest buildings in the world cannot be conclusively determined. For instance, the Lighthouse of Alexandria, which was completed in approximately 280 BC, has been estimated to have been 100 m (330 ft) tall, but its true height is not known. For thousands of years, the Great Pyramid in Egypt was the tallest structure in the world until Lincoln Cathedral of 1311, but the Great Pyramid is not considered a building since it is not habitable. Similarly, the Eiffel Tower was the world's tallest structure from 1889, when it was built, but not the tallest building.\nThe skyscraper was invented in Chicago in 1884 when Home Insurance Building was constructed using a steel frame with curtain walls instead of load-bearing walls. For the next century, the world's tallest building was always in the United States, with New York City housing the tallest building for  86 years and Chicago housing it for 30 years. After just over a century (1885–1998), the distinction of the world's tallest building moved to Malaysia, which was the first country to break the United States' record of constructing the tallest buildings in the world when Petronas Towers was completed in 1998. Taiwan's Taipei 101 was the next to hold the record; the building's status as the world's tallest building lasted from 2004 to 2009, when it was transferred to the Burj Khalifa, the current record-holder of 828 meters tall, upon its completion in the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\n== Definition of terms ==\n\n\n=== Meaning of \"building\" ===\nThe earliest structures now known to be the tallest in the world were the Egyptian pyramids: the Great Pyramid of Giza, at an original height of 146.5 m (481 ft), was the tallest structure in the world for over 3,800 years, until the construction of Lincoln Cathedral in 1311. From then until the completion of the Washington Monument (capped in 1884) the world's tallest structures were churches or cathedrals. Later, the Eiffel Tower and, still later, some radio masts and television towers, were the world's tallest structures.\nHowever, though all of these are structures, some are not buildings in the sense of being regularly inhabited or occupied. It is in this sense of being regularly inhabited or occupied that the term \"building\" is generally applied when determining the world's tallest building. The non-profit international organization Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH), which maintains a set of criteria for determining the height of tall buildings, defines a \"building\" as \"(A) structure that is designed for residential, business or manufacturing purposes\" and that \"has floors\".\nTall churches and cathedrals occupy a middle ground: their lower areas are regularly occupied, but much of their height is in bell towers and spires which are not. Whether a church or cathedral is a \"building\" or merely a \"structure\" for the purposes of determining the title of \"world's tallest building\" is a subjective matter of definition (this article treats churches and cathedrals as buildings).\n\n\n=== Determination of height ===\nThe Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) has been generally recognized as the arbiter on the building height of skyscrapers since the mid-20th century. In the early 1970's they promulgated the criteria that height is measured \"from the sidewalk of the main entrance to the structural top of the building including penthouse and tower.\" In 1996, during the controversy over whether the Petronas Twin Towers or the Sears Tower should be considered t\nSydney, the largest city in Australia, is home to 1,168 completed high-rise buildings, more than any other city in Australia. Of those completed or topped out, the entire city (including metropolitan suburbs) has 54 buildings that reach a height of at least 150 metres (490 ft), of which 17 reach a height of at least 200 metres (660 feet) – the second–highest number of skyscrapers in Australia, as well as a further 16 buildings rising to at least 150 metres (490 feet) in height currently under construction.\nAlthough the tallest buildings in the city have historically been concentrated in the central business district and immediate surrounding areas such as Barangaroo and Ultimo, suburbs within the Sydney metropolitan area have all seen a substantial surge in the development of high rises and skyscrapers in recent years, with major satellite centres such as Chatswood, Parramatta, North Sydney, St Leonards and Macquarie Park all witnessing or playing host to the construction of skyscrapers rising above 150 metres. As a result, Sydney has the tallest building and most skyscrapers (reaching at least 150 metres or above) outside an inner city area or core in Australia.\nSydney was one of the first cities in Australia and internationally to welcome the introduction of skyscrapers and high-rise office blocks in the mid 20th century, alongside cities in the U.S., including New York City and Chicago. Witnessing a boom in the 20th century, Sydney has played host to various buildings which have held the title of the tallest building in Australia including St James' Church, the Sydney Town Hall, the Garden Palace, the General Post Office, AWA Tower, AMP Building, 25 Martin Place, and the Australia Square tower in 1967 at 170 metres (560 feet) tall, which was Australia's first true skyscraper as defined as rising above or at least 150 metres high. Since 2020, Crown Sydney has been Sydney's tallest building and the 4th tallest building in Australia, rising to a height of 271 metres (889 feet).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nSydney played host to Australia's first tallest building in 1824 with the construction of St James' Church. Standing at a height of 52 metres (171 feet), it was commissioned by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1819, designed by Francis Greenway and constructed between 1820 and 1824 using convict labour. The partially complete Sydney Town Hall, built in Victorian Second Empire style, surpassed this height in 1878 with the completion of its clock tower that stood at a height of 57 metres (187 feet). This title was briefly held until the completion of the Garden Palace in 1879, standing at a height of 64 m (210 ft). The Garden Palace likewise only held this title as tallest briefly, after its demise from a fire in 1882. Hence, the Sydney Town Hall once again became Sydney's tallest until 1891 with the completion of the General Post Office. Standing at a height of 73 m (240 ft), the GPO was at the time described upon opening by the Postmaster General as a building that \"will not be surpassed by any other similar structure in the southern hemisphere\".\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century and throughout the beginning of the 20th century, advances in building technology and design coupled with rising urban land values meant that high rise buildings became an attractive proposition in Sydney. Considered to be Sydney's first high-rise office building, Culwulla Chambers, was completed in 1912 and stood at a height of 50 metres (160 ft). Designed by Spain, Cosh and Minnett (with Rupert Minnett), the building consisted of 14 floors and cost £100,000 to build, equivalent of approximately $1 million in today's money. This new wave of construction of taller buildings consequently raised concerns over fire risks, namely the inadequate firefighting resources of the period that failed to reach such heights. The fire in the 8 storey Anthony Hordern & Sons building in 1901, which resulted in the death of five peopl\nThe Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) defines a residential building as one where 85 percent or more of its total floor area is dedicated to residential usage.\nCurrently, the tallest residential building in the world is Central Park Tower in a part of Midtown Manhattan, New York City, colloquially referred to as \"Billionaires' Row\". It was topped out at a height of 472.4 metres (1,550 ft) in 2019.\nAs of 2024, New York City is also home to all top three tallest residential buildings in the world, while Dubai in the United Arab Emirates has five of the ten tallest.\n\n\n== History and ranking criteria ==\nSince 2000, when CTBUH started maintaining a list of tallest residential buildings, The Belcher's Tower 1 and The Belcher's Tower 2 located in Hong Kong were the first tallest residential buildings whose heights equal 221 metres (725 ft) and were completed in 2000.\nIn 2001, Trump World Tower in New York City became the tallest residential building in the world, until it was surpassed in 2003 by the 21st Century Tower followed by the Q1 on the Gold Coast in 2005. In 2012, Princess Tower in Dubai became the tallest residential building in the world, before being surpassed by 432 Park Avenue in New York City in 2014. The current tallest residential building, Central Park Tower, was topped out during September 2019 and completed in 2020.\nThe percentage of residential buildings whose height exceeds 200 metres increased from 34 percent in 2009 to 45 percent in 2010, making Burj Khalifa the world's first megatall building to include residential space.\nThe CTBUH insist that a building should only be added to the official tallest list when it is (i) topped out structurally and architecturally, (ii) fully clad, and (iii) open for business, or at least partially open. This became the CTBUH official definition of a building's \"completion\".\n\n\n== Tallest residential buildings ==\nThis lists ranks residential buildings that stand at least 300 metres (980 ft) tall, based on standard height measurement. This includes spires and architectural details, but does not include antenna masts. An equal sign (=) following a rank indicates the same height between two or more buildings.

The tallest structure in Toronto is the CN Tower, which rises 553.3 metres (1,815 ft). The CN Tower was the tallest free-standing structure on land from 1975 until 2007. However, it is not generally considered a high-rise building as it does not have successive floors that can be occupied. The tallest habitable building in the city is First Canadian Place, which rises 298 metres (978 ft) tall in Toronto's Financial District and was completed in 1975. It also stands as the tallest building in Canada.\nThe history of skyscrapers in Toronto began in 1894 with the construction of the Beard Building, which is often regarded as the first skyscraper in the city. Toronto went through its first building boom in the late 1920s and early 1930s, during which the number of high-rise buildings in the city vastly increased. After this period, there was a great lull in construction between 1932 and 1964 with only a single building above 91.5 metres (300 ft) tall being built.\nThe city then experienced a second, much larger building boom, which was at its peak between 1967 and 1976. This period saw the construction of Canada's three tallest buildings and six of its top ten (at the time). When topped off in 1967, the TD Bank Tower was the 14th tallest building in the world. The TD Tower would soon be followed by Commerce Court West, the 14th tallest building in the world at the time of its completion in 1972. Later, Canada's current tallest building, the First Canadian Place, became the eighth tallest building in the world at the time of its completion in 1975. After the mid-1970s, the pace of the boom slowed considerably but continued onto the early 1990s, culminating with the construction of the city's and Canada's second and third tallest buildings: Scotia Plaza and the TD Canada Trust Tower.\nAfter this boom, the city went through a third, shorter lull in construction from 1993 to 2004, in which the city added only one new building to its top 20. By 2005 however, the city's third and largest high-rise construction boom began with the completion of One King Street West and has continued unabated ever since with nearly 50 planned, under construction or recently built buildings over 152.4 metres (500 ft) tall. Of the 21 buildings in Toronto taller than 200 metres, only seven were built prior to 2010. In 2012, The St. Regis Toronto (then known as Trump International Hotel and Tower) was completed, with a top dome height of 252 m (827 ft) and an antenna height of 277 metres (908 ft), making it the fourth-tallest structure in Toronto and all of Canada. With the completion in late 2014 of Aura—which, at 78 storeys and a height of 272 m (892 ft), is the tallest residential building in Canada—the tallest building under construction is the 328.4-metre (1,077 ft) tall The One (though the developer applied for a height increase to 338 metres (1,109 ft)), also a residential building.\nNatalie Alcoba of the National Post described this phenomenon as the \"Manhattanization\" of Toronto in reference to the built-up nature of the namesake island borough in New York City. In one week of 2018, Toronto City Council approved 755 storeys of new development in the city's downtown core. The Toronto skyline (especially the CN Tower) can be spotted by the naked eye during clear daylight skies from locations as far as Newmarket from the north, Clarington from the east, several points along the Niagara Escarpment from the west, and Fort Niagara State Park in the south across Lake Ontario in the U.S. state of New York.\nAs of January 2023, Toronto has constructed 81 skyscrapers and has a further 36 under construction. Toronto also has 92 skyscrapers that are either approved or in the proposal stage. Toronto currently ranks 20th in the world with most skyscrapers already completed, third in North America and first in Canada. Toronto ranks fourth in the world and first in North America with the numb\nThe Spiral, also known as 66 Hudson Boulevard, is a 66-floor, 1,031-foot (314 m) skyscraper with 2.85 million square feet (265,000 m2), on 34th Street between Hudson Boulevard and Tenth Avenue in Hudson Yards, Manhattan, New York City. It was developed by Tishman Speyer, constructed by Turner Construction, and opened in 2023.\nThe building got its name as each floor has outdoor gardens that spiral around the facade of the building in a continuous green pathway. It was designed by Bjarke Ingels Group, which also designed the nearby West 57. Space Copenhagen provided interior design services. The building includes a clubhouse and an open-air terrace with panoramic city views on the 66th floor, along with a lounge. The building has an irrigation system provided by Bosch that is designed to save 4.5 million gallons of water per year compared to other systems.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe tower was conceptualized in 2014 as the Hudson Spire, with a 1,800-foot (550 m) roof height and a 2,000-foot (610 m) architectural height. It was marketed as the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere.\nTishman Speyer spent $438 million acquiring the site for the property.\nIn late 2015, Tishman Speyer paid $25 million to two men who lived together as tenants in a four-story building on the future site of the building to get them to relocate. While Tishman had prevailed in court, the tenants threatened to delay the development by five years via additional court cases.\nPlans for the building were filed in September 2016.\nIn April 2018, a mortgage real estate investment trust managed by Blackstone Inc. provided a $1.8 billion construction loan, one of the largest such loans in New York City history.\nThe building topped-out in January 2021.\nIn March 2023, the building won the CoStar Impact Award for best commercial development in the New York City region.\n\n\n== Tenants ==\nThe building includes a restaurant run by Erik Ramirez and Juan Correa in its base. Ramirez and Correa are known for Llama San, in the West Village and Llama Inn, in Williamsburg.\nTenants include:\n\nFloor 2: NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital - Och Spine Center\nFloors 3–5: HSBC\nFloors 7–21: Pfizer\nFloor 22: Baker Tilly\nFloor 23: NCC-group PLC\nFloors 25–28: AllianceBernstein\nFloor 28: ProShares, SEB Group\nFloors 32–33: Marshall Wace\nFloors 35–36: Turner Construction\nFloors 40–52: Debevoise & Plimpton\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of tallest buildings in New York City\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",
