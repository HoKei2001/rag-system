        "content": "San Francisco, California, in the United States, has at least 482 high-rises, 58 of which are at least 400 feet (122 m) tall. The tallest building is Salesforce Tower, which rises 1,070 ft (330 m) and as of April 2023 is the 17th-tallest building in the United States.  The city's second-tallest building is the Transamerica Pyramid, which rises 853 ft (260 m), and was previously the city's tallest for 45 years, from 1972 to 2017. The city's third-tallest building is 181 Fremont, rising to 802 ft (244 m).\nSan Francisco has 27 skyscrapers that rise at least 492 feet (150 m). Six more skyscrapers of over 150 m are under construction, have been approved for construction, or have been proposed. Its skyline is currently ranked second in the Western United States (after Los Angeles) and sixth in the United States, after New York City, Chicago, Miami, Houston, and Los Angeles.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSan Francisco's first skyscraper was the 218-foot (66 m) Chronicle Building, which was completed in 1890.  M. H. de Young, owner of the San Francisco Chronicle, commissioned Burnham and Root to design a signature tower to convey the power of his newspaper.  Not to be outdone, de Young's rival, industrialist Claus Spreckels, purchased the San Francisco Call in 1895 and commissioned a tower of his own that would dwarf the Chronicle Building.  The 315-foot (96 m) Call Building was completed in 1898 and stood across Market Street from the Chronicle Building.  The Call Building (later named the Spreckels Building, and Central Tower today) would remain the city's tallest for nearly a quarter century.\nBoth steel-framed structures survived the 1906 earthquake, demonstrating that tall buildings could be safely constructed in earthquake country.  Other early twentieth-century skyscrapers above 200 feet (61 m) include the Merchants Exchange Building (1903), Humboldt Bank Building (1908), Hobart Building (1914), and Southern Pacific Building (1916).  Another skyscraper boom took hold during the 1920s, when several Neo-Gothic and Art Deco high rises, reaching three to four hundred feet (90 to 120 m) in height, were constructed, including the Standard Oil Building (1922), Pacific Telephone Building (1925), Russ Building (1927), Hunter-Dulin Building (1927), 450 Sutter Medical Building (1929), Shell Building (1929), and McAllister Tower (1930).\nThe Great Depression and World War II halted any further skyscraper construction until the 1950s when the Equitable Life Building (1955) and Crown-Zellerbach Building (1959) were completed. Many of San Francisco's tallest buildings, particularly its office skyscrapers, were completed in a building boom from the late 1960s until the late 1980s. During the 1960s, at least 40 new skyscrapers were built, and the Hartford Building (1965), 44 Montgomery (1967), Bank of America Center (1969), and Transamerica Pyramid (1972) each, in turn, took the title of tallest building in California upon completion.  At 853 feet (260 m) tall, the Transamerica Pyramid was one of the most controversial, with critics suggesting that it be torn down even before it was completed.\nThis surge of construction was dubbed \"Manhattanization\" by opponents and led to local legislation that set some of the strictest building height limits and regulations in the country.  In 1985, San Francisco adopted the Downtown Plan, which slowed development in the Financial District north of Market Street and directed it to the area South of Market around the Transbay Terminal. Over 250 historic buildings were protected from development and developers were required to set aside open space for new projects. To prevent excessive growth and smooth the boom-and-bust building cycle, the Plan included an annual limit of 950,000 square feet (88,000 m2) for new office development, although it grandfathered millions of square feet of proposals already in the development pipeline.  In response, voters approved Proposition M in November 1986 that reduced the annual limit to 475\nThis list ranks skyscrapers/high rise buildings and structures in the US State of California by height. Buildings and structures in seven cities are included in this list; Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Long Beach, Sacramento, Burbank and Oakland each have buildings taller than 400 feet (120 m). \nThe tallest building is the Wilshire Grand Center at 1,100 feet (340 m). All of the buildings and structures taller than 500 feet (150 m) are in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The tallest building in San Diego rises exactly 500 feet due to restrictions imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the 1970s, because of the downtown's proximity to San Diego International Airport.\n\n\n== Buildings over 500 feet ==\n\n\n== Buildings from 400 to 500 feet ==\n\n\n== Timeline of tallest buildings in California ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of tallest buildings in Los Angeles\nList of tallest buildings in San Francisco\nList of tallest buildings in Sacramento\nList of tallest buildings in Oakland\nList of tallest buildings in Long Beach\nList of tallest buildings in San Diego\nList of tallest buildings in San Jose\n\n\n== References ==\n301 Mission Street is a high-rise residential building in the South of Market district of downtown San Francisco. A mixed-use, primarily residential high rise, it is the tallest residential building and the 6th-tallest overall in San Francisco. In May 2016, residents were informed the main tower was both sinking and tilting, resulting in several lawsuits concerning repair costs and whether the existence of the tilt had been withheld from buyers.\nOpened to residents on April 23, 2009, 301 Mission includes two buildings: a 12-story tower located on the northeast of the property, and Millennium Tower, a 58-story, 645-foot-tall (197 m) condominium skyscraper. The blue-gray glass, late-modernist buildings are bounded by Mission, Fremont, and Beale Streets, and the north end of the Salesforce Transit Center site. In total, the project has 419 residential units, with 53 of those units in the smaller tower. The larger tower's highest level, 58 floors above the ground, is listed as the 60th, because floors 13 and 44 are missing for superstitious reasons.\n\n\n== Description ==\nDeveloped by Mission Street Development LLC, an affiliate of Millennium Partners, the US$350 million project was designed by Handel Architects, engineered by DeSimone Consulting Engineers and built by Webcor Builders. At 645 feet (197 m), it is the tallest concrete structure in San Francisco, the fourth-tallest building in San Francisco, and the tallest built since 345 California Street in 1986. It was the tallest residential building west of the Mississippi River, but has been surpassed by The Austonian in Texas. The tower is slender, with each floor containing 14,000 square feet (1,300 m2) of floor space. In addition to the 58-story tower, there is a 125-foot (38 m), 11-story tower on the northeast end of the complex. Between the two towers is a 43-foot (13 m), two-story glass atrium. In total, the project has 419 units.\nThe residences are expensive; a penthouse unit sold for $13 million in December 2016. The bottom 25 floors of the main tower are marketed  as Residences while the floors from 26 to the top are marketed as Grand Residences. As happens with many high-rises, there is no thirteenth floor because of superstitions related to triskaidekaphobia. Neither is there a forty-fourth floor, because the number four is considered unlucky by many Asians. The 53 units in the separate 12-story tower are marketed as  City Residences. Below street level, there are 434 parking spaces in a five-level subterranean garage located under the 11-story tower. The building is located next to the site of the Salesforce Transit Center. The tower's design was marketed as resembling a translucent crystal, and was, until accompanied by much larger adjacent buildings, a landmark for the Transbay Redevelopment and the southern skyline of San Francisco.\nResident services include a private concierge and access to the 20,000-square-foot (1,900 m2) Owner's Club Level, which features amenities such as a private lounge, wine cellar, and fitness center. The development's \"lifestyle\" program organizes cultural events. The development accommodates the International Smoke restaurant and bar, located on the ground floor.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMillennium Partners first proposed the development in 2002 with 163 condominiums, 108 rentals and a 136-unit \"extended stay\" hotel. The project was approved in 2003 by the S.F. Planning Commission 4â€“1 and construction began in 2005. The only vote against the project came from Planning Commissioner Sue Lee. The development was the first high rise built downtown in 20 years. According to Modern Luxury, a proposed 52-story skyscraper at nearby 80 Natoma by developer Jack Myers which would also have a similar cast in place concrete construction, was rejected by the city's Department of Building Inspections (DBI) after an outside peer review. The Millennium Tower received no such scrutiny, since Millennium Partners would not submit to a peer review, as that study wou\nThe world's first skyscraper was built in Chicago in 1885. Since then, the United States has been home to some of the world's tallest skyscrapers. New York City, and especially the borough of Manhattan, has the tallest skyline in the country. Eleven American buildings have held the title of tallest building in the world. New York City and Chicago have been the centers of American skyscraper building. The 10-story Home Insurance Building, built in Chicago in 1885, is regarded as the world's first skyscraper; the building was constructed using a novel steel-loadbearing frame which became a standard of the industry worldwide.\nSince its topping out in 2013, One World Trade Center in New York City has been the tallest skyscraper in the United States. Its spire brings the structure to a symbolic architectural height of 1,776 feet (541 m), connoting the year the Declaration of Independence was signed, though the absolute tip (or pinnacle) of the structure is measured at 1,792 ft (546 m). However, the observation deck elevation and the height to the highest occupied floor of One World Trade Center are surpassed by Central Park Tower, 432 Park Avenue, 111 West 57th Street, and Chicago's Willis Tower, which was formerly and is still commonly known as Sears Tower. Tribune East Tower in Chicago will also have a higher occupied floor and roof upon its completion.\nPrior to the September 11 attacks in New York City, the twin towers of the first World Trade Center occupied the second and third positions on the list below. The North Tower (1 WTC) stood at 1,368 feet (417 m), while the South Tower (2 WTC) was 1,362 feet (415 m) tall, then surpassed only by the Willis Tower at 1,450 feet (442 m). If they were still standing today, they would occupy the seventh and eighth positions on the list below, with their replacementâ€”the new One World Trade Centerâ€”being excluded.\nThere are numerous skyscrapers and supertall buildings both proposed and under construction throughout the country, concentrated in Chicago and New York City. 270 Park Avenue, in New York City, is currently under construction. In Chicago, work for Tribune East Tower has not begun but tentatively planned to start in February 2024. Other tall buildings that are proposed include the 1,907-foot-tall (581 m) Legends Tower in Oklahoma City, the 1,010-foot-tall (310 m) One Bayfront Plaza, and the 1,049-foot-tall (320 m) One Brickell Centre in Miami.\n\n\n== Tallest buildings ==\nThis list ranks completed and topped-out buildings in the United States that stand at least 800 feet (244 m) tall, based on standard height measurement which includes spires and architectural details, but excludes antenna masts.

It is home to the city's largest concentration of corporate headquarters, law firms, insurance companies, real estate firms, savings and loan banks, and other financial institutions. Multiple Fortune 500 companies headquartered in San Francisco have their offices in the Financial District, including Wells Fargo, Salesforce, and Gap.\nSince the 1980s, restrictions on high-rise construction have shifted new development to the adjacent South of Market (SoMa) area surrounding the Transbay Transit Center. This area is sometimes called the South Financial District by real estate developers, or simply included as part of the Financial District itself.\nThe early 2020s have seen high office vacancy rates in the Financial District, driven by remote work since the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among tech companies. Several owners of office buildings and hotels have defaulted on their loans, raising concerns about the effect on San Francisco's tax revenues and the financial stability of local government services. Many retailers have also cited high levels of crime, open-air drug use, homelessness, doubts about San Francisco's viability as a relevant commercial center, and closed storefronts in the areas in and around the adjacent Union Square.\nThe area is marked by a cluster of high-rise towers in the triangular area east of Kearny Street, south of Washington Street, west of the Embarcadero that rings the waterfront, and north of Market Street. The district includes Northern California's two tallest buildings, the Salesforce Tower and the Transamerica Pyramid. Montgomery Street (sometimes called \"Wall Street of the West\") is considered the traditional heart of the district.\n\n\n== History ==\nUnder Spanish and Mexican rule, the area had been  the site of a harbor named Yerba Buena Cove with a small civilian outpost named Yerba Buena that served to support the military population of the Presidio and the Mission Dolores. The sandy, marshy soils of the tip of the San Francisco Peninsula discouraged the Spanish, and later Mexican governments from establishing a preeminent town there, who focused their pueblo settlement efforts in the Pueblo of San JosÃ© with its extremely fertile land. It was not until 1835 that the first settlers established themselves on the shore of Yerba Buena Cove, with the first town plan surveyed in 1839. Yerba Buena's potential as a seaport made it the eventual center for European and American settlement.\nAfter gold was discovered in the Sierra Nevada Foothills in 1848, Yerba Buena's location on the natural harbor of San Francisco Bay acted as a magnet for European and American settlers, as well as gold and job seekers from a multitude of countries. Following Californian independence and American annexation and the California Gold Rush, the area boomed rapidly and the Bay shoreline, which originally ended near Montgomery Street, was filled in and extended to The Embarcadero. Gold Rush wealth and business made it the financial capital of the west coast as many banks and businesses set up in the neighborhood. The west coast's first and only skyscrapers, were built in the area along Market Street.\nThe neighborhood was nearly completely destroyed in the 1906 Earthquake and Fire, as the area's skyscrapers survived. By 1910, the area was largely rebuilt with low-rise, masonry-clad buildings ranging from six to twelve stories in height.  During the late 1920s, several Neo-Gothic high rises, reaching 300 to 400 feet in height, were constructed, including the Standard Oil Building, Russ Building, Hunter-Dulin Building, Shell Building, and the Pacific Telephone Building.\n\nWith the onset of the Great Depression and statewide height restrictions due to earthquake fears, few new buildings were constructed, and the district remaine\nSan Diego, a major coastal city in Southern California, has over 200 high-rises mainly in the central business district of downtown San Diego. In the city there are 42 buildings that stand taller than 300 feet (91 m). In the 1970s, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) began restricting downtown building height to maximum of 500 feet (152 m) within a 2.3-mile (3.7 km) radius of San Diego International Airport's single runway. The tallest building in the city is the 34-story One America Plaza, completed in 1991, which stands 500 feet (152 m) tall.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of skyscrapers in San Diego began with the completion of the U.S. Grant Hotel in 1910. The building, at a height of 211 feet (64 m), remained the tallest building in San Diego until 1927, when the El Cortez Hotel at 310 feet (94 m) took its place. The skyscraper's height was surpassed in 1967 by the 530 B Street, which stood as the tallest building for two decades with its height of 388 feet (118 m). In 1989, with a height of 499 feet (152 m), Symphony Towers gained the title, before being passed two years later by One America Plaza. During the 1990s, the city was compared to a \"handful of tools in a scarcely stocked toolbox\" and a \"mouth with a lot of missing teeth\". Development in the late 1990s and 2000s led to many new high-rises, mainly residential skyscrapers. Many of these new residential buildings are pairs of twin towers.I believe that our skyline is a collective composition of many buildings. We don't have to have one landmark like the Empire State Building or Petronas towers. I think the landmark is the entire Downtown.\nAs of October 2019, San Diego is ranked 98th in the world and 3rd in California with its 162 high-rises. However, due to the FAA height restriction, none of San Diego's buildings are within the top 100 tallest buildings in the United States. As of October 2019, there are around 20 buildings that have been proposed, approved, or are currently undergoing construction which will join the tallest buildings in San Diego (over 300 feet).\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Tallest buildings ==\n  \nThis list ranks San Diego skyscrapers that stand at least 300 feet (91 m) tall, based on standard height measurement.

It is the fourth tallest building in the city as of February 2021, and in 2013 was the largest by floor area. Completed in 1969, the tower was the tallest building west of the Mississippi River until the completion of the Transamerica Pyramid in 1972, and the world headquarters of Bank of America until the 1998 merger with NationsBank, when the company moved its headquarters to the Bank of America Corporate Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. It is currently owned by Vornado Realty Trust and The Trump Organization.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nColloquially known as \"Triple Five\" and/or \"Triple Nickel\", 555 California Street was meant to display the wealth, power, and importance of Bank of America. Design was by Wurster, Bernardi and Emmons and Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, with architect Pietro Belluschi consulting; structural engineering was by the San Francisco firm H. J. Brunnier Associates. It is the 75th tallest building in the United States, one foot taller than One Worldwide Plaza in New York City and just 1 foot shorter than the 68th tallest building in the US, which is also owned by Bank of America, the Bank of America Center in Houston, Texas at 780 ft (238 m), and just 2 feet shorter than the 67th tallest building in the US, 30 Hudson Street in Jersey City, New Jersey at 781 ft (238 m). Some sites round the heights of all four buildings to 780 ft (238 m) making those four buildings tied as the 67th tallest buildings in the country. As of February 2021, 555 California Street is the 89th tallest building in the United States, and the 103rd tallest in North America.\nThe skyscraper has thousands of bay windows, meant to improve the rental value and to symbolize the bay windows common in San Francisco residential real estate. The irregular cutout areas near the top of the building were designed to suggest the Sierra Nevada. At the north side of the skyscraper is a broad plaza named in honor of Bank of America founder A.P. Giannini.\nIn the plaza the 200-ton black Swedish granite sculpture \"Transcendence\" by Masayuki Nagare is known as the \"Banker's Heart\". Nearly the entire blockâ€”the skyscraper, the banking hall, the plaza, the stairways, and the sidewalksâ€”is clad in costly polished or rough carnelian granite. A restaurant, the \"Carnelian Room,\" was on the 52nd floor. The elevator to this restaurant is one of the few publicly accessible high-speed elevators in San Francisco. The restaurant closed at midnight New Year's Eve 2009.\nThe southeast corner of California and Kearny is about 35 feet (11 m) above sea level, so the top of the building is over 800 feet (240 m). With the Transamerica Pyramid, 555 California Street shows the direction San Francisco's downtown was moving during the 1960s before campaigns against high-rise buildings in the 1970s and 1980s forced development to move south of Market Street. With its top spire, the Transamerica Pyramid is taller, but 555 California has the higher habitable space.\nIn April 2018, the United States Geological Survey included 555 California Street in a list of 39 high-rise buildings in San Francisco constructed during a period when welding techniques were employed that may jeopardize structural integrity during a strong earthquake.\nA 70 percent interest was acquired by Vornado Realty Trust from foreign investors in March 2007 with a 30 percent limited partnership interest still owned by The Trump Organization In 2019, the building generated $86 million in net operating income ($60 million going to Vornado and $26 million to Trump Organization), and it had $543 million of debt attached to it in 2020. Trump's stake in 555 California Street is one of his largest holdings as of 2020. Forbes estimated in 2020 that Trump owes $162 million to an unknown creditor for this object alone; the loan comes due in 2021. At least one tenant in this building whose rent benefits \nDallas, the third-largest city in the U.S. state of Texas, is the site of 42 completed high-rise buildings over 350 feet (107 m), 20 of which stand taller than 492 feet (150 m). The tallest building in the city is the Bank of America Plaza, which rises 921 feet (281 m) in Downtown Dallas and was completed in 1985. It also stands as the 3rd-tallest building in Texas and the 40th-tallest building in the United States. The second-tallest skyscraper in the city is the Renaissance Tower, which rises 886 feet (270 m) and was completed in 1974. The Comerica Bank Tower, completed in 1987 and rising 787 feet (240 m), is the third-tallest building in Dallas. Three of the ten tallest buildings in Texas are located in Dallas.\nThe history of skyscrapers in the city began with the construction of the Praetorian Building in 1909. That building, rising 184 feet (56 m) and 14 floors, is often regarded as the first skyscraper in Dallas or even the entire Western United States; it was demolished in 2013. Dallas's first building standing more than 492 feet (150 m) was the Mercantile National Bank Building, completed in 1943. During the 1980s energy boom, the city saw a significant number of completed projects. There are currently four buildings under construction that are planned to rise at least 350 feet (107 m). Overall, the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat ranks Dallas's skyline (based on existing and under construction buildings over 492 feet (150 m) tall) 3rd in the Southern United States (after Miami and Houston) and 9th in the United States.\n\n\n== Tallest buildings ==\nAs of September 2020, 43 high-rise buildings in Dallas stand at least 350 feet (107 m) tall, based on standard height measurement.

Located at 600 Montgomery Street between Clay and Washington Streets in the city's Financial District, it was the tallest building in San Francisco from its completion in 1972 until 2018 when the newly-constructed Salesforce Tower surpassed its height. The building no longer houses the headquarters of the Transamerica Corporation, which moved its U.S. headquarters to Baltimore, Maryland. The building is still associated with the company by being depicted on the company's logo. Designed by architect William Pereira and built by Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company, the building stands at 853 feet (260 m). On completion in 1972 it was the eighth-tallest building in the world. It is also a popular tourist site. In 2020, the building was sold to NYC investor Michael Shvo, who in 2022 hired Norman Foster to redesign the interiors and renovate the building.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Transamerica building was commissioned by Transamerica CEO John (Jack) R. Beckett, with the claim that he wished to allow light in the street below. Built on the site of the historic Montgomery Block, it has a structural height of 853 feet (260 m) and has 48 floors of retail and office space.\nConstruction began in 1969 and finished in 1972, and was overseen by San Franciscoâ€“based contractor Dinwiddie Construction, now Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company. Transamerica moved its headquarters to the new building from across the street, where it had been based in a flatiron-shaped building now occupied by the Church of Scientology of San Francisco.\nAlthough the tower is no longer Transamerica Corporation headquarters, it is still associated with the company and is depicted in the company's logo. The building is evocative of San Francisco and has become one of the many symbols of the city. Designed by architect William Pereira, it faced opposition during planning and construction and was sometimes referred to by detractors as \"Pereira's Prick\". John King of the San Francisco Chronicle summed up the improved opinion of the building in 2009 as \"an architectural icon of the best sort â€“ one that fits its location and gets better with age.\" King also wrote in 2011 that it is \"a uniquely memorable building, a triumph of the unexpected, unreal and engaging all at once. ... It is a presence and a persona, snapping into different focus with every fresh angle, every shift in light.\"\nThe Transamerica Pyramid was the tallest skyscraper west of Chicago when constructed, surpassing the then Bank of America Center, also in San Francisco. It was surpassed by the Aon Center, Los Angeles, in 1974.\nThe building is thought to have been the intended target of a terrorist attack, involving the hijacking of airplanes as part of the Bojinka plot, which was foiled in 1995.\nIn 1999, Transamerica was acquired by Dutch insurance company Aegon. When the non-insurance operations of Transamerica were later sold to GE Capital, Aegon retained ownership of the building as an investment. In 2020, the building was purchased by SHVO and Deutsche Finance America for $650 million. In 2022, SHVO and partners hired architect Norman Foster to undertake a $250 million renovation.\nThe Transamerica Pyramid was the tallest skyscraper in San Francisco from 1972 to 2017, when it was surpassed by the under-construction Salesforce Tower. It is one of 39 San Francisco high rises reported by the U.S. Geological Survey as potentially vulnerable to a large earthquake, due to a flawed welding technique.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe land use and zoning restrictions for the parcel limited the number of square feet of office that could be built upon the lot, which sits at the north boundary of the financial district.\nThe building is a tall, four-sided pyramid with two \"wings\" to accommodate an elevator shaft on the east and a stairwell and a smok\nSan Francisco City Hall is the seat of government for the City and County of San Francisco, California. Re-opened in 1915 in its open space area in the city's Civic Center, it is a Beaux-Arts monument to the City Beautiful movement that epitomized the high-minded American Renaissance of the 1880s to 1917. The structure's dome is taller than that of the United States Capitol by 42 feet (13 m). The present building replaced an earlier City Hall that was destroyed during the 1906 earthquake, which was two blocks from the present one.\nThe principal architect was Arthur Brown, Jr., of Bakewell & Brown, whose attention to the finishing details extended to the doorknobs and the typeface to be used in signage. Brown also designed the San Francisco War Memorial Opera House, Veterans Building, Temple Emanuel, Coit Tower and the Federal office building at 50 United Nations Plaza.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe building's vast open space is more than 500,000 square feet (46,000 m2) and occupies two full city blocks. It is 390 ft (120 m) between Van Ness Avenue and Polk Street, and 273 ft (83 m) between Grove and McAllister Streets. Its dome, which owes much to Mansart's Baroque domes of the Val-de-GrÃ¢ce (church) and Les Invalides in Paris, rises 307.5 ft (93.7 m) above the Civic Center Historic District. It is 19 ft (5.8 m) higher than the United States Capitol, and has a diameter of 112 ft (34 m), resting upon 4 x 50 ton (44.5 metric ton) and 4 x 20 ton (17.8 metric ton) girders, each 9 ft (2.7 m) deep and 60 ft (18 m) long.\nThe building as a whole contains 7,900 tons (7,035 metric tons) of structural steel from the American Bridge Company of Ambridge, Pennsylvania near Pittsburgh. It is faced with Madera County granite on the exterior, and Indiana sandstone within, together with finish marbles from Alabama, Colorado, Vermont, and Italy. Much of the statuary is by Henri Crenier.\nThe upper levels of the Rotunda are public and handicapped accessible. Opposite the grand staircase, on the second floor, is the office of the Mayor. Bronze busts of former Mayor George Moscone and his successor, Dianne Feinstein, stand nearby as tacit reminders of the Moscone assassination, which took place just a few yards from that spot in the smaller rotunda of the mayor's office entrance. A bust of former county supervisor Harvey Milk, who was assassinated in the building was unveiled on May 22, 2008. The inscription that dominates the grand Rotunda and the entrance to the mayor's small rotunda, right below Father Time, reads:\n\nThe words were written by the previous Mayor Edward Robeson Taylor, and dedicated by Mayor James Rolph.\nWhile plaques at the Mall entrance memorialize President George Washington's farewell address and President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, the primary themes of the statuary are to the past mayors, with the dates of their terms in office. The medallions in the vaults of the Rotunda are of Equality, Liberty, Strength, Learning and, as memorialized in the South Light Court display, Progress.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFrom 1849 to 1850, San Francisco's municipal government was on the west side of Portsmouth Square at the Office of the Alcalde,:â€Š718â€Š who was the municipal magistrate, with both judicial and administrative functions, and the ayuntamiento, the town council, or cabildo. \nIn May 1850, after the first City Charter was adopted, the first San Francisco City Hall was established at the former Graham House on the corner of Kearny and Pacific streets, which was later consumed by the great fire of June 1851.:â€Š273,â€Š315,â€Š345â€Š In 1852, San Francisco City Hall was at 750 Kearny Street between Washington and Merchant Streets, at the converted Jenny Lind Theatre building and Parker House, located then between the El Dorado Hotel and The Union, opposite the east side of Portsmouth Square. Later, this was the site of a Hall of Justice, as seen on the TV series, Ironside. \n\nThe 1916 City Hall building is a replacement for the 1899 building, begun \nThis list of tallest church buildings ranks church buildings by height. From the Middle Ages until the advent of the skyscraper, Christian church buildings were often the world's tallest buildings. From 1311, when the spire of Lincoln Cathedral surpassed the height of the Great Pyramid of Giza, until the Washington Monument was completed in 1884, a succession of church buildings held this title.\n\nThe tallest church building in the world is the Ulm Minster (161.5 m), the main Lutheran congregation in Ulm, Germany.\nThe tallest Catholic, as well as the tallest domed church building, is the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace (158 m) in Yamoussoukro, Ivory Coast.\nThe tallest church building with two steeples as well as the tallest cathedral is Cologne Cathedral (157.4 m) in Cologne, Germany.\nThe tallest Eastern Orthodox, as well as the tallest domed cathedral, will be People's Salvation Cathedral (now 120 m; 127 m when completed) in Bucharest, Romania.\nThe tallest brickwork church building is St Martin's Church (130.6 m) in Landshut, Germany.\nThe tallest brickwork church building with two steeples is St Mary's Church (125 m) in LÃ¼beck, Germany.\nThe tallest wooden church building is SÄƒpÃ¢nÈ›a-Peri Monastery church (78 m) in SÄƒpÃ¢nÈ›a, Romania.\nThe tallest church building in the Americas is the Cathedral of MaringÃ¡ (124 m) in MaringÃ¡, Brazil.\nIf completed, the Sagrada FamÃ­lia in Barcelona, Spain, will be the tallest church building in the world, at 172.5 metres (566 ft).\nThe cities with the most churches surpassing 99 metres (325 feet) are Hamburg (5 of the 29 tallest churches, with 5 towers overall), LÃ¼beck (4 of the 56 tallest churches, two of which with twin towers â†’ 6 towers overall), Vienna (2), Tallinn (2), St. Petersburg (2), New York City (2), Dortmund (2) and Stralsund (2).\nThe cities with the most churches surpassing 75 metres (246 feet) are Berlin (16), Hamburg (9), Paris (8), Dresden (8), Vienna (7), Stockholm (7) and Munich (7), while in the Americas it is New York City (4).\n\n\n== Constructed ==\n\n\n=== Church buildings â‰¥ 99 m (325 ft) ===\nThis list does not include church buildings that incorporate a significant portion of space to non-church uses, such as the Chicago Temple Building.

The United States is considered the birthplace of the skyscraper, with the world's first skyscraper, the Home Insurance Building, built in Chicago in 1885. Since then, the United States has been home to some of the world's tallest skyscrapers, with the tallest in New York City and Chicago. Eleven buildings in North America have held the title of tallest building in the world, with 9 in New York City. Canada and Mexico have also seen areas of skyscraper building, especially in Toronto, Calgary, Mexico City and Monterrey. Additionally, Panama City has emerged as a hotbed of skyscraper building activity and currently lists a total of 49 buildings over 150 meters in height.\n\n\n== List ==\nThis list ranks completed and topped-out buildings in North America that stand at least 235 meters (771 ft.) tall, based on standard height measurement which includes spires and architectural details. An equal sign (=) following a rank indicates the same height between two or more buildings. The \"Year\" column indicates the year in which a building was completed. This list includes Central America. No countries in the Caribbean have buildings taller than 200 meters.\n\nOf the 120 buildings in this list, 38 (33%) are in New York City.

Bay windows were identified as a defining characteristic of San Francisco architecture in a 2012 study that had a machine learning algorithm examine a random sample of 25,000 photos of cities from Google Street View.\nIcons of San Francisco architecture include the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz Island, Coit Tower, the Palace of Fine Arts, Lombard Street, Alamo Square, Fort Point, the Transamerica Pyramid, and Chinatown. Included below are summaries of the historical significance of some of these great San Franciscan architectural achievements.\n\n\n== Fort Point ==\n\nAt the foot of the Golden Gate bridge is Fort Point, built to protect the Bay from naval attacks. Designed to allow cannons to hit enemy ships at water level, Fort Point is the only one of its kind in the west. It was originally constructed under the leadership of Spanish Lieutenant Jose Joaquin Moraga. Moraga had been sent up from Monterey, about 100 miles south of San Francisco, to build fortifications in the San Francisco Bay in order to secure Spanish control over the whole area. In 1792, he built a Presidio style fort, which had sufficient fortifications, but was clearly not strong enough to truly act as the main defense of the harbor.\nIn 1796, Moraga redesigned the fort and gave it the name, Castillo de San JoaquÃ­n. Unfortunately, the fort was built from adobe brick and constructed on sand, meaning that the adobe cracked when one of the cannons was fired and that each winter the Fort would be heavily damaged from the weather. After the Mexican War of Independence in 1821, the Spanish were forced to abandon all of posts in California, including the Castillo. Once the fort was abandoned, the Mexican government attempted to maintain it and others of its kind, but the young government simply did not have the resources to do so. All of the forts in California were abandoned by 1835.\nAfter California was granted statehood in 1850, the fort still sat unused until 1856, when the United States government allotted $500,000 (about $14 million in today's money) to install fortifications in California. The people in charge of the fortifications decided to rebuild The Castillo de San JoaquÃ­n, but using much more modern materials and building techniques. The fort was built on a granite foundation with masonry walls 12 feet thick. The fort was loaded with weapons and renamed Fort Point. At the time, the fort was incredibly impressive and served as the main fortification protecting the San Francisco bay. It was also the most powerful heavily fortified fort on the west coast when it was built. However, after the civil war, masonry forts of its type were rendered technologically obsolete, leaving Fort Point as simply a testament to San Francisco's pre-Civil War military might.\n\n\n== The Golden Gate Bridge ==\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is the most instantly recognizable structure in the city of San Francisco. The bridge spans almost two miles across the Golden Gate, the narrow strait where San Francisco Bay opens to meet the Pacific Ocean, connecting the city with Marin County, California.\nThe concept of a Golden Gate Bridge started with a journalist named James Wilking. Wilking promoted the idea that a bridge across the Golden Gate would bring many benefits. The idea for this bridge had surfaced forty years earlier, but over time people had lost interest, at least until Wilking revived the idea. In 1919, authorities commissioned Joseph Strauss to conduct a survey of the proposed site for the bridge. The main argument in favor of the bridge's construction was that it would help encourage development north of San Francisco.\nStrauss became fascinated with the bridge, and began drawi\n555 Mission Street is a 33-story, 147 m (482 ft)[A] office tower in the South of Market area of San Francisco, California. Construction of the tower began in 2006 and the tower was finished on September 18, 2008. It was the tallest office building constructed in San Francisco in the 2000s, and is the 25th tallest building in San Francisco.\nThe building is the part of a new generation of skyscrapers in San Francisco's downtown built on Mission Street since 2000, including The Paramount, the St. Regis Museum Tower, Millennium Tower, 101 Second Street, and JP MorganChase Building.\n\n\n== History ==\nTishman Speyer acquired the land for the project in 1999. The tower was originally approved by the Planning Commission on April 5, 2001, to rise 137.5 m (451 ft) and 30 stories. A revised plan, adding three stories and raising the height to 147 m (482 ft), was approved on December 13, 2001. However, due to the downturn in the office market after the dot-com bust, developer Tishman Speyer froze the project waiting for economic conditions to improve. In 2006, five years after the building was approved for construction, work on the tower finally began.\nIn January 2008, Tishman Speyer signed DLA Piper to occupy 82,000 sq ft (8,000 m2) floors 22 to 26 of the tower. In March 2008, law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher agreed to take up 60,000 sq ft (6,000 m2) of office space in the tower. In October 2009, Intellectual Property law firm Novak Druce + Quigg moved into the 34th floor penthouse of the building. As of summer 2008, close to half of the building's office space has been leased, with the possibility of more tenants moving in.  In 2010, Deloitte signed a 15-year lease to occupy 10 floors of the building, becoming the anchor tenant, and taking up most of the remaining space.\nIn June 2012, Tishman Speyer sold the building to Union Investment for US$446.5 million.\n\n\n== Design ==\n555 Mission Street is 147 m (482 ft) with 33 above ground office floors on a 34,293 square feet (3,186 m2) site located on Mission Street. There are two basement levels containing 180 parking spaces in a below-grade parking garage. The entire building is split into three zones, which are referred to as Low Rise, Mid Rise, and High Rise.\nThe Low Rise section (floors 1 to 12) contains a 20,700 square feet (1,923 m2)-floorplate and the Mid Rise section (floors 14 to 22) contains a 18,000 square feet (1,670 m2)-floorplate. The highest region, the High Rise (floors 23 to 33), contains a 16,000 square feet (1,490 m2)-floorplate. The building does not have a floor numbered thirteen. The floor to ceiling height of the building is 9 feet (2.7 m). To support the office tower, 555 Mission has a steel frame structure. The metal decks and concrete will support the office floors. Enclosing the steel structure is a glass curtain wall that has protruding glass and metal accent fins.\nThe building was awarded LEED Gold certification by the USGBC, and is San Francisco's first LEED Gold office tower. Examples of green elements within the building are low flow toilets and a reflective roof to deflect solar energy. The developer of the tower is Tishman Speyer.\nThe building fronts on a mid-block plaza between Mission Street and Minna Street.  The park, required as part of a public space initiative by the City of San Francisco, features large outdoor sculptures by Ugo Rondinone and Jonathan Borofsky.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of tallest buildings in San Francisco\n\n\n== Notes ==\nA. a b c Note: Two different height figures are given.

It contains several sub-neighborhoods including South Beach, Yerba Buena, and Rincon Hill.\nSoMa is home to many of the city's museums, to the headquarters of several major software and Internet companies, and to the Moscone Conference Center.\n\n\n== Name and location ==\nThe area's boundaries are Market Street to the northwest, San Francisco Bay to the northeast, Mission Creek to the southeast, and Division Street, 13th Street and U.S. Route 101 (Central Freeway) to the southwest. It is the part of the city in which the street grid runs parallel and perpendicular to Market Street. The neighborhood includes many smaller sub-neighborhoods such as: South Park, Yerba Buena, South Beach, and Financial District South (part of the Financial District), and overlaps with several others, notably Mission Bay, and the Mission District.\nAs with many neighborhoods, the precise boundaries of the South of Market area are fuzzy and can vary widely depending on the authority cited. From 1848 until the construction of the Central Freeway in the 1950s, 9th Street (formerly known as Johnston Street) was the official (and generally recognized) boundary between SoMa and the Mission District. Since the 1950s, the boundary has been either 10th Street, 11th Street, or the Central Freeway. Similarly, the entire Mission Bay neighborhood may or may not be counted as part of SoMa, Excluding the entire Mission Bay neighborhood puts the southeastern boundary at Townsend. Redevelopment agencies, social service agencies, and community activists frequently exclude the more prosperous areas between the waterfront and 3rd Street. Some social service agencies and nonprofits count the economically distressed area around 6th, 7th, and 8th streets as part of the Mid-Market Corridor. \nThe terms \"South of Market\" and \"SoMa\" refer to both a comparatively large district of the city as well as a much smaller neighborhood.\nWhile many San Franciscans refer to the neighborhood by its full name, South of Market, there is a trend to shorten the name to SOMA or SoMa, probably in reference to SoHo (South of Houston) in New York City, and, in turn, Soho in London.\nBefore being called South of Market this area was called \"South of the Slot\", a reference to the cable cars that ran up and down Market along the slots through which they gripped cables. While the cable cars have long since disappeared from Market Street, some \"old timers\" still refer to this area as \"South of the Slot\".\nSince 1847 , the official name of the South of Market area has been the \"100 Vara Survey\" (alternately \"100 Vara District\") or simply \"100 Vara\" for short (with \"100\" sometimes spelled out).  The \"100 Vara Survey\" derived its name from the surface area of the single lots which comprised 100 by 100 varas (275 square feet).\nAccording to city documents from 1945, the \"100 Vara District\" goes from the south side of Market Street to the Ferry.  The name is found mainly in history books, legal documents, title deeds, and civil engineering reports.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1847 Washington A. Bartlett, alcalde (magistrate) of the pueblo (village) of San Francisco, commissioned surveyor Jasper O'Farrell to extend the boundaries of the pueblo in a southerly direction by creating a new subdivision. At the time, the streets of San Francisco were aligned approximately with the compass points, running north to south, or east to west. Each block was divided into six lots 50 varas on a side. (A vara is about 33 inches (84 cm).) O'Farrell decided that the streets in the new subdivision should run parallel with or perpendicular to the only existing road in the area, Mission Road (later Mission Street), and thus be aligned with the half-points of the compass, i.e., northeast to southwest, and northwest to southeast. He also decided to make the new blocks twice as long and twice as wide, with each lot 100 varas on a side. Fi\nThis list of tallest buildings in Florida ranks the tallest buildings (170 metres (560 ft) or higher) in the U.S. state of Florida by height. The tallest building in the state is the 85-story Panorama Tower, which rises 868 feet (265 m) in the City of Miami's Brickell neighborhood and was completed in 2017.\nFlorida has 45 buildings that are 550 feet (170 m) or higher. The majority are located in the City of Miami, and over 94% are in the Greater Miami area while the rest are in the Tampa and Jacksonville areas. None of them are in the Orlando area. Of the 37 tallest buildings in Florida, 24 are in the City of Miami, 14 are in Sunny Isles Beach, 2 are in Miami Beach, 2 are in Tampa, and 1 is in Jacksonville. The Greater Miami area accounts for 34 of the 37 tallest buildings over 550 feet in Florida. Miami alone is ranked as the third largest skyline in the United States after New York City and Chicago, even without counting the extended skyline up the beach to Sunny Isles and Fort Lauderdale. \nThe majority of the skyscrapers in Miami are within the Greater Downtown Miami area, specifically the neighborhoods of the Central Business District (including the Downtown Miami Historic District), Arts & Entertainment District, Brickell, and Edgewater.\n\n\n== Tallest buildings ==\nThis list ranks the tallest buildings in Florida that stand at least 550 ft (or 167m) tall, based on standard height measurement.

The base of the tower includes a six-story tall, outdoor \"urban room\" of public open space.  The tower will feature diagonal, exterior bracing and taper towards the top, reminiscent of the John Hancock Center in Chicago.  If completed as proposed, the 905-foot (276 m) tower would become San Francisco's second-tallest building after Salesforce Tower, surpassing the long time record-holder, the Transamerica Pyramid.\nThe shorter tower, at 512 Mission Street, is planned to climb 605 feet (184 m) and will contain the 169-room Waldorf Astoria San Francisco hotel on the first 21 floors and approximately 154 residential units on the upper 33 floors.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe parcels around 50 First Street were upzoned as part of the Transit Center District Plan approved in 2012 in conjunction with the new Salesforce Transit Center.  The parcels were originally assembled by developer David Choo and a plan was floated in 2007 for towers as tall as 1,200 feet (370 m) designed by Renzo Piano.  Choo was eventually forced to sell the property during the 2008 financial crisis.\nIn 2013, TMG Partners and Northwood Investors acquired the property out of bankruptcy court for US$122 million.  TMG and Northwood hired Foster + Partners and Heller Manus Architects to re-design the project.  In 2015, Beijing-based Oceanwide Holdings acquired the property for US$296 million. A groundbreaking ceremony for the buildings was held on December 8, 2016.\nConstruction on the shorter of the two towers was suspended in 2019 due to economic conditions. Subsequently, the construction on the second, taller tower was also halted in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2024 the sale of the stalled project was blocked by legal disputes.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of tallest buildings in San Francisco\n\n\n== External links ==\nOceanwide Center - Foster + Partners\n\n\n== References ==\nThe city of San Jose, California, known for its height-limited downtown skyline due to its proximity to San Jose International Airport, has over 46 high-rises, mostly in downtown.

According to data from the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH), there are 33 buildings in Austin with heights of at least 100 m (330 ft). CTBUH also ranks Austin 19th nationally and 3rd statewide based on the number of completed buildings with heights of at least 490 ft (150 m). The aggregated heights of Austin's high-rises is second in Texas, behind Houston, based on data from Texas Real Estate Source. The current tallest completed building in Austin is Sixth and Guadalupe, with a height of 874 ft (266 m), followed by The Independent at 690 ft (210 m) and The Austonian at 680 ft (210 m). The Independent has been the tallest completed building in Austin and the tallest in Texas outside of Dallas and Houston since its completion in 2019, though its height was surpassed by the 875 ft (267 m) tall Sixth and Guadalupe currently under construction.\nBearing a height of 311 ft (95 m), The Texas State Capitol remained the tallest structure in Austin long after its construction in the 1880s, with the city's central Congress Avenue otherwise lined with single-story buildings through the start of the 1900s. The eight-story Scarbrough Building and the nine-story Littlefield Building, built between 1910 and 1912, were Austin's first high-rise buildings; the Littlefield Building was the tallest commercial building in the U.S. west of New Orleans and east of San Francisco upon its completion. In 1928, the Austin City Council briefly considered setting a 100 ft (30 m) height limit for future construction in the city but backed away from the proposal.\nAfter the mid-20th century, Downtown Austin began to transition from being predomniantly composed of low-rise buildings to a skyline with high-rises. Beginning with the 26-story Westgate Tower, the addition of new skyscrapers to Downtown Austin between 1967 and 1980 led to an increasing realization that views of the state capitol from certain vantage points could become obscured. The capitol was also no longer the city's tallest building, surpassed in height by the Dobie Center and the Chase Bank Tower. In response, the Texas State Legislature and the City of Austin created 35 Texas Capitol View Corridors that would preserve selected views of the capitol. By the mid-1980s, Austin featured over a dozen skyscrapers, with at least 12 buildings built during the decade featuring at least 15 floors. Described by the Austin American-Statesman as \"the first downtown high-rise wave\", the uptick in skyscraper construction that began in the 1980s was mostly characterized by granite and limestone office buildings. More rapid construction of new high-rises in downtown Austin began by the 1990s and continued thereafter, contrasting a concurrent slowdown in the construction of new skyscrapers in Dallas and Houston. Mark Lamster, an architecture critic for the Dallas Morning News, attributed the emergence of increasingly taller skyscrapers to the small size and high density of Austin, incentivizing vertical growth due to the resultingly high cost of land. The Statesman identified a second wave of new skyscrapers in Austin that began in the early 2000s, including construction of the Frost Bank Tower. By 2010, the construction of new residential buildings and office space for technology companies accounted for most of the city's new skyscrapres. By 2023, the combined height of Austin's high-rises overtook Dallas according to Texas Real Estate Source.\n\n\n== Historical skyline appearance ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Tallest buildings ==\n  \nAustin has 55 completed buildings that stand at least 250 feet (76 m) tall based on standard height measurement.

Unless otherwise noted, heights and floor \nSeattle, Washington, United States, the most populous city in the Pacific Northwest region of North America, has 118 completed high-rise buildings over 240 feet (73 m), of which 53 are over 400 feet (120 m) tall. An additional 65 high-rise buildings are under construction or undergoing planning and design review, as of 2016.\nThe tallest building in Seattle is the 76-story Columbia Center, which rises 937 feet (286 m) and was completed in 1985. It is currently the 41st-tallest building in the United States, and the tallest building in the state of Washington. The 20 tallest buildings in Washington are all located in Seattle.\nIn terms of the number of skyscrapers over 493 feet (150 m), Seattle's skyline is ranked first in the Northwestern United States, third on the West Coast (after Los Angeles and San Francisco) and seventh in North America.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAfter the Great Seattle Fire of June 6, 1889, Seattle began reconstruction of the city's central business district under a new building code requiring the use of fireproof materials, such as stone and brick. By the end of 1890, 465 buildings had been built, completing the initial phase of reconstruction, and city boosters looked to build modern high-rise buildings after the infusion of new money from the Klondike gold rush later that decade. The Pioneer Building, whose observation tower surpassed 110 feet (34 m), was completed in 1892 and is regarded as the city's first modern high-rise building. The Alaska Building, completed in 1904 and rising 203 feet (62 m) above 2nd Avenue in Pioneer Square, is considered to be Seattle's first skyscraper and first steel-framed high-rise building. It held the title of tallest habitable building in the city until the completion of the 205-foot (62 m), 18-story Hoge Building in 1911. Both buildings had been surpassed in height by the clocktower of King Street Station, opened in 1906, which stands 245 feet (75 m) tall.\nSeattle's continued growth at the turn of the century, bolstered by the hosting of the Alaskaâ€“Yukonâ€“Pacific Exposition in 1909 and the opening of the Metropolitan Tract to development, led to a building boom north of Yesler Way in the modern-day downtown. On July 4, 1914, firearm and typewriter magnate Lyman Cornelius Smith opened the 484-foot-tall (148 m) Smith Tower, the city's new tallest building. For several years, the 38-story tower would hold the title of tallest west of the Mississippi River, and dominate the Seattle skyline. By the end of the 1920s building boom, several new Art Deco high-rises above 200 feet (61 m) were completed in Seattle, including the Medical Dental Building (1925), Seattle Tower (1930), Roosevelt Hotel (1929), Washington Athletic Club (1930), Textile Tower Building (1930), Harborview Medical Center (1931), and Pacific Tower (1933).\nNew high-rise construction in Seattle was halted during the Great Depression and World War II, and slowed during the post-war economic boom in the 1950s, as suburbanization took hold in the region. The first new building in downtown to be built after the war was the Norton Building in 1959, a 19-story office building in the International Style with a glass curtain wall and simple exterior features, a departure from the previous Neo-Gothic and Art Deco styles used in high-rises. By 1959, office space occupying downtown buildings had overtaken retail uses, with over 4,987,000 square feet (463,300 m2). Seattle was selected to host the World's Fair in 1962, revitalizing the downtown area and bringing the construction of the fairgrounds' centerpiece, the Space Needle. The 605-foot (184 m) observation tower became the symbol of the fair and a landmark for Seattle, and was the first new structure to surpass the Smith Tower in height.\n\nThe 50-story Seafirst Building (now Safeco Plaza) became the city's tallest when it opened in 1969, standing 630 feet (190 m), and signaled the start of a major construction boom in Downtown Seattle. The boom would last well into the 1980s, \nThis is a list of list of buildings and nonbuilding structures.\n\n\n== By type ==\n\n\n== By age ==\nList of oldest buildings\nList of oldest buildings in Canada\nList of oldest structures in Toronto\nList of oldest buildings in Britain\nList of oldest buildings in Scotland\nList of oldest buildings in United States of America\n\n\n== By region ==\n\n\n== By size ==\n\n\n== By architect ==\n\n\n== By building material ==\nList of Brick Gothic buildings\nList of Brick Romanesque buildings\nList of cobblestone buildings\n\n\n== Other ==\nList of works similar to the 2020 Utah monolith\nList of bizarre buildings\nList of buildings and structures illustrated on banknotes\nList of most expensive buildings\nList of octagonal buildings and structures\nList of twisted buildings\nList of visionary tall buildings and structures\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nWorld Heritage Site\n\n\n== External links ==\nInternational Architecture database - archINFORM\ngreat building collection with 3D massing model for free\nThe San Francisco Federal Building, formally the Speaker Nancy Pelosi Federal Building, is an 18-story, 234 ft-tall (71.3 m) building at 90 7th Street on the corner of Mission and 7th streets in the South of Market neighborhood of San Francisco, California. The federal building was designed by the Morphosis architectural firm, as a supplement to the Phillip Burton Federal Building several blocks away. Thom Mayne of Morphosis designed the building using a juxtaposition of gray concrete walls, perforated metal panels, and custom, faceted wood ceilings. The building was expected to be completed in 2005, but construction issues and delays pushed the project completion to 2007.\nThe building was designed to be a 'green' building consuming less than half the power of a standard office tower. Utilizing natural light to illuminate 80 percent of the building helped it achieve worldwide recognition as the first Federal Building to be certified under the USGBC's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) criteria. Its southern wall is draped with translucent panels of perforated stainless steel (3 by 8 feet in size), intended to accumulate solar heat and thereby create an upward air flow, which in turn causes cooler air to enter the building through sensor-controlled windows, achieving an air conditioning effect. The result has been criticized as unsatisfactory by employees working in the building, which has received low workplace satisfaction ratings. \nThe building features some elevators which stop on every third floor to promote employee interaction and health.   Users of the building exit the elevators and walk either up or down one floor via stairs.  There are, however, also elevators which stop on every floor for users unable or unwilling to negotiate stairs. As of 2019, there were concerns that the courtyard had become a large marketplace for illegal drugs at nighttime. In 2023 workers were told to stay home due to rampant illicit activity in the vicinity of the building. \n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe San Francisco Chronicle's architecture critic John King called the building \"both daunting and dazzling, up to and including the stainless steel panels that fold over the broad concrete frame like some immense origami whim. Like it or not, this is architecture at its provocative best. The 18-story structure and its four-story annex show how buildings fit together. They demonstrate that simple materials can be used in fresh ways, and they prod you to think about how design and the environment are linked.\" According to his colleague at the Los Angeles Times, Christopher Hawthorne, the building \"shows what happens when a celebrated American architect is compelled [...] to embrace sustainability. And it dramatizes a clash between the prerogatives of architectural creativity and the basics of sustainable design\". He called the result a \"hulking, aggressive tower [... and] perhaps the most ambitious of the federal governmentâ€™s effort, through the General Services Administrationâ€™s 'design excellence' program, to make new courthouses and office buildings models of forward-looking design.\"\n\nThe San Francisco Federal Building has been called an example of the \"innovative public building projects that embrace contemporary design strategies and material approaches\" that were enabled by the 1962 \"Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture\" directive. The construction budget and cost for the building was $144 million. The architect's decision to eliminate the usual HVAC system saved $11 million in construction costs. At the same time, the design's nonfunctional use of extended, folded metal sunshading at ground level, which in the opinion of some are purely for aesthetic effect, and require extensive galvanized steel bracing, added millions in materials and fabrication costs back into the project.\nMorphosis' design was selected at least partly because of its projected energy efficiency; a requirement of the GSA's brief. At the time of design, t\nThis is a list of the tallest known species of trees, as reflected by measurements of the tallest reliably-measured individual specimen. Although giant trees grow in both tropical and temperate regions, they are very restricted geographically and phylogenetically. All the known giant trees occur in mesic climates, and nearly all of them are found in three regions: western North America from California to British Columbia, Southeast Asia (especially Borneo) and southeastern Australia (especially Tasmania).\n\n\n== Tallest living individuals by species ==\nThe following are the tallest reliably-measured specimens from the top species. This table contains information on all species for which at least one specimen has been reliably measured at 80 meters (262 feet) or taller.\n\n\n== Maximum limits of tree height ==\nTwo main opposing forces affect a tree's height; one pushes it upward while the other holds it down. By analyzing the interplay between these forces in coast redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens), a team of biologists led by George Koch of Northern Arizona University calculated the theoretical maximum tree height or the point at which opposing forces balance out and a tree stops growing. This point lies somewhere between 122 and 130 m (400 and 426 feet). On the one hand, the researchers found, trees in forests \"desire\" to grow as tall as possible to overtake neighboring trees and reach stronger sunlight. On the other hand, gravity makes it more and more difficult to haul water upwards from the roots to the canopy as the tree grows, and leaves thus become smaller near the top. They discovered that despite the moistness of the ground far below, the leaves at the treetops struggle to get enough water, so they are effectively living in a constant drought. The difficulty of getting water so far up into the sky is what ultimately constrains growth. Other researchers have developed models of maximum height for Coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) trees that yield similar estimates of 109â€“138 meters (357â€“452 feet), a range that includes the height of the tallest reliably-measured historical (dead) specimen, a 126-meter tree.\n\n\n== Other claims of superlative height ==\nThere are many historical and contemporary claims of superlative height for species beyond those listed in the table above. For example, several articles published in 1878 describe an Eucalyptus amygdalina exceeding 380 feet (120 m) and others nearing 420 feet (130 m) up to 500 feet (150 m), including the Nooksack Giant which was measured using a tape at 465 feet (142 m) after being cut down.\nThe heights of the tallest trees in the world have been the subject of considerable dispute and much exaggeration. Modern verified measurements with laser rangefinders or with tape drop measurements made by tree climbers (such as those carried out by canopy researchers), have shown that some older tree height measurement methods are often unreliable, sometimes producing exaggerations of 5% to 15%  or more above the real height.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of individual trees\nList of oldest trees\nList of superlative trees\nList of tallest buildings and structures\n\n\n== References ==\nThis is a list of the tallest buildings in the City and County of Denver, Colorado, United States. The tallest building in Denver is the 56-story Republic Plaza, which rises 717 feet (219 m) and was completed in 1984. It stands as the 137th-tallest building in the United States, and the tallest building in the State of Colorado. The second-tallest skyscraper in the city and the state is 1801 California Street, which rises 709 feet (216 m). 29 of the 30 tallest buildings in Colorado are located in Denver.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe history of skyscrapers in Denver began with the completion of the Equitable Building in 1892; this building, rising 143 feet (44 m) and nine floors, was the first high-rise in Denver. The title of the city's \"first skyscraper\" is usually given to the Daniels & Fisher Tower, which rises 325 feet (99 m) and was completed in 1910. The city went through a large building boom that lasted from the early 1970s to the mid-1980s. During this time, 21 of the city's 27 tallest buildings were constructed, including Republic Plaza, 1801 California Street, and the Wells Fargo Center. The city is the site of eight skyscrapers over 492 feet (150 m) in height, including two which rank among the tallest in the United States. Overall, the skyline of Denver is ranked (based upon existing and under construction buildings over 492 feet (150 m) tall) second in the Mountain States (after Las Vegas) and seventeenth in the United States.[A] \nThe tallest building recently completed in Denver is the Four Seasons Hotel and Tower, which rises 45 stories and 641 feet (195 m). It now stands as the fourth-tallest building in Denver as well as the city's tallest residential tower. The 1144 Fifteenth office tower rises just over 600 feet at over 40 stories making it the fifth-tallest building in Denver upon completion early 2018. Denver is currently experiencing a mid-high rise residential building boom with several large projects under construction throughout the city and more than 20 new projects breaking ground downtown Denver, golden triangle and RINO in 2023.\n\n\n== Tallest buildings ==\nThis lists ranks Denver skyscrapers that stand at least 300 feet (91 m) tall, based on standard height measurement.

The Wilshire Grand became the city's tallest building upon its completion 2017, and is also currently the tallest building in the state, the tallest building in the U.S. west of the Mississippi River, as well as the 15th-tallest building in the U.S. overall. \nThe 73-story U.S. Bank Tower, which rises 1,018 feet (310 m) in Downtown Los Angeles and was completed in 1989, is now the second-tallest building in Los Angeles.\nSix of the ten tallest buildings in California are located in Los Angeles. The history of skyscrapers in Los Angeles began with the 1903 completion of the Braly Building, which is often regarded as the first high-rise in the city; it rises 13 floors and 151 feet (46 m) in height. The building, originally constructed as a commercial structure, has since been renovated into a residential tower and is now known as the \"Continental Building\".\nIn 1904, Los Angeles imposed height restrictions throughout the city, prohibiting the construction of any building taller than 150 feet (46 m). An exception was made for Los Angeles City Hall, built from 1926 to 1928, which stands at 454 feet (138 m). This effectively limited the height of non-government buildings to 13 stories, and was intended to address local concerns about growing congestion and over development at the time. That height limit was lifted in Downtown Los Angeles by the city government in 1957. By 1958 they imposed a flat roof ordinance on all new high-rises, which was to accommodate fire-fighting equipment.\nLos Angeles (and especially downtown) then went through a large building boom that lasted from the early 1960s to the early 1990s, during which time the city saw the completion of 17 of its 30 tallest buildings, including the U.S. Bank Tower, the Aon Center, and Two California Plaza. Modern skyscrapers are difficult and expensive to construct in Los Angeles, as well as the resulting difficulty of adhering to the city's rigorous engineering standards. Nevertheless, a number of successful and iconic skyscrapers dot the Los Angeles skyline from Downtown Los Angeles (DTLA) through Koreatown, along the Wilshire Corridor and Miracle Mile, in addition to Century City and other areas of the city's west side. Other skyscraper hubs in Los Angeles include Century Boulevard by Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), the Hollywood district in central Los Angeles, as well as Warner Center, Encino and Universal City in the San Fernando Valley. Los Angeles's west side has so many skyscrapers that often Wilshire Boulevard in the Westwood District and Century City's skyscrapers are confused with being DTLA by visitors arriving from LAX. The flat roof ordinance was rescinded in 2014.\nAs of August 2023, Los Angeles has over 816 high-rise buildings over 100 feet (30 m), most as low rise apartment buildings, 54 buildings over 400 feet (120 m), and 21 buildings over 600 feet (183 m), including two supertalls over 1,000 feet (305 m), the Wilshire Grand and U.S. Bank Tower. Its skyline is ranked first in the Pacific coast region and fifth in the United States, after New York City, Chicago, Miami and Houston.\n\n\n== Tallest buildings ==\n\nBuildings in the height range.\n\nThis lists ranks Los Angeles skyscrapers that stand at least 400 feet (122 m) tall, based on standard height measurement.

Not to be outdone, de Young's rival, industrialist Claus Spreckels, purchased the San Francisco Call in 1895 and commissioned a tower of his own that would dwarf the Chronicle Building.  The 315-foot (96 m) Call Building was completed in 1898 and stood across Market Street from the Chronicle Building.

Over 250 historic buildings were protected from development and developers were required to set aside open space for new projects. To prevent excessive growth and smooth the boom-and-bust building cycle, the Plan included an annual limit of 950,000 square feet (88,000 m2) for new office development, although it grandfathered millions of square feet of proposals already in the development pipeline.

The tower is slender, with each floor containing 14,000 square feet (1,300 m2) of floor space. In addition to the 58-story tower, there is a 125-foot (38 m), 11-story tower on the northeast end of the complex. Between the two towers is a 43-foot (13 m), two-story glass atrium.

Unfortunately, the fort was built from adobe brick and constructed on sand, meaning that the adobe cracked when one of the cannons was fired and that each winter the Fort would be heavily damaged from the weather. After the Mexican War of Independence in 1821, the Spanish were forced to abandon all of posts in California, including the Castillo. Once the fort was abandoned, the Mexican government attempted to maintain it and others of its kind, but the young government simply did not have the resources to do so. All of the forts in California were abandoned by 1835."

The people in charge of the fortifications decided to rebuild The Castillo de San JoaquÃ­n, but using much more modern materials and building techniques. The fort was built on a granite foundation with masonry walls 12 feet thick. The fort was loaded with weapons and renamed Fort Point. At the time, the fort was incredibly impressive and served as the main fortification protecting the San Francisco bay. It was also the most powerful heavily fortified fort on the west coast when it was built. However, after the civil war, masonry forts of its type were rendered technologically obsolete, leaving Fort Point as simply a testament to San Francisco's pre-Civil War military might."

The bridge spans almost two miles across the Golden Gate, the narrow strait where San Francisco Bay opens to meet the Pacific Ocean, connecting the city with Marin County, California.\nThe concept of a Golden Gate Bridge started with a journalist named James Wilking. Wilking promoted the idea that a bridge across the Golden Gate would bring many benefits. The idea for this bridge had surfaced forty years earlier, but over time people had lost interest, at least until Wilking revived the idea. In 1919, authorities commissioned Joseph Strauss to conduct a survey of the proposed site for the bridge.

The capitol was also no longer the city's tallest building, surpassed in height by the Dobie Center and the Chase Bank Tower. In response, the Texas State Legislature and the City of Austin created 35 Texas Capitol View Corridors that would preserve selected views of the capitol. By the mid-1980s, Austin featured over a dozen skyscrapers, with at least 12 buildings built during the decade featuring at least 15 floors. Described by the Austin American-Statesman as \"the first downtown high-rise wave\", the uptick in skyscraper construction that began in the 1980s was mostly characterized by granite and limestone"

More rapid construction of new high-rises in downtown Austin began by the 1990s and continued thereafter, contrasting a concurrent slowdown in the construction of new skyscrapers in Dallas and Houston. Mark Lamster, an architecture critic for the Dallas Morning News, attributed the emergence of increasingly taller skyscrapers to the small size and high density of Austin, incentivizing vertical growth due to the resultingly high cost of land. The Statesman identified a second wave of new skyscrapers in Austin that began in the early 2000s, including construction of the Frost Bank Tower. By 2010, the construction of new residential buildings and office space for technology companies accounted for most of the city's new skyscrapres. By 2023, the combined height of Austin's high-rises overtook Dallas according to Texas Real Estate Source."

This point lies somewhere between 122 and 130 m (400 and 426 feet). On the one hand, the researchers found, trees in forests \"desire\" to grow as tall as possible to overtake neighboring trees and reach stronger sunlight. On the other hand, gravity makes it more and more difficult to haul water upwards from the roots to the canopy as the tree grows, and leaves thus become smaller near the top. They discovered that despite the moistness of the ground far below, the leaves at the treetops struggle to get enough water, so they are effectively living in a constant drought.

The history of skyscrapers in Los Angeles began with the 1903 completion of the Braly Building, which is often regarded as the first high-rise in the city; it rises 13 floors and 151 feet (46 m) in height. The building, originally constructed as a commercial structure, has since been renovated into a residential tower and is now known as the \"Continental Building\"."

An exception was made for Los Angeles City Hall, built from 1926 to 1928, which stands at 454 feet (138 m). This effectively limited the height of non-government buildings to 13 stories, and was intended to address local concerns about growing congestion and over development at the time. That height limit was lifted in Downtown Los Angeles by the city government in 1957. By 1958 they imposed a flat roof ordinance on all new high-rises, which was to accommodate fire-fighting equipment."

Modern skyscrapers are difficult and expensive to construct in Los Angeles, as well as the resulting difficulty of adhering to the city's rigorous engineering standards. Nevertheless, a number of successful and iconic skyscrapers dot the Los Angeles skyline from Downtown Los Angeles (DTLA) through Koreatown, along the Wilshire Corridor and Miracle Mile, in addition to Century City and other areas of the city's west side. Other skyscraper hubs in Los Angeles include Century Boulevard by Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), the Hollywood district in central Los Angeles, as well as Warner Center, Encino and Universal City in the San Fernando Valley.
