{"page_content": "The Solomon Sea is a sea located within the Pacific Ocean. It lies between Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands. Many major battles were fought there during World War II.\n\n\n== Extent ==\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Solomon Sea as follows:\n\nOn the Northwest. By the Southeast limit of Bismarck Sea [A line from the Southern point of New Ireland along the parallel of 4\u00b050' South to the coast of New Britain, along its Northern coast and thence a line from its Western extreme through the Northern point of Umboi Island to Teliata Point, New Guinea (5\u00b055\u2032S 147\u00b024\u2032E)].\nOn the Northeast. By a line from the Southern point of New Ireland to the North point of Buka Island, through this island to the Northwest point of Bougainville Island, along the Southern coasts of Bougainville, Choisel [Choiseul], Ysabel [Santa Isabel], Malaita and San Cristobal [Makira] Islands.\nOn the South. The Northern limit of the Coral Sea between San Cristobal Island, the Solomon Islands, and Gado-Gadoa Island, off the Southeast extreme of New Guinea [Gado-Gadoa Island near its Southeastern extreme (10\u00b038\u2032S 150\u00b034\u2032E), down this meridian to the 100-fathom [600 ft; 183 m] line and thence along the Southern edges of Uluma (Suckling) Reef and those extending to the Eastward as far as the Southeast point of Lawik Reef (11\u00b043.5\u2032S 153\u00b056.5\u2032E) off Tagula Island [Vanatinai], thence a line to the Southern extreme of Rennell Island and from its Eastern point to Cape Surville, the Eastern extreme of San Cristobal Island].\nOn the Southwest. By the coast of New Guinea and a line from its Southeasternmost point through the Louisiade Archipelago to Rossel Island.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Solomon Sea is named after the Solomon Islands. These islands received their name \"Islas Salom\u00f3n\" from the legend of the biblical land of Ophir \u2014 fabled as the source of King Solomon's wealth which was hoped to be discovered, in the first 1568 voyage by their discoverer Spanish navigator \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a de Neira. They were so named after his voyage when it was mapped.\n\n\n== Deepest point ==\nThe Solomon Sea roughly corresponds with the Solomon Sea Plate, a tectonic feature, and includes the New Britain Trench, in the New Britain subduction zone, which reaches its maximum depth at 29,988 feet (9,140 m) below sea level in the Planet Deep.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMap of the Solomon Sea. at the Library of Congress Web Archives (archived 2006-10-21)\nLimiting Factor, known as Bakunawa since its sale in 2022, is a crewed deep-submergence vehicle (DSV) manufactured by Triton Submarines and owned and operated since 2022 by Gabe Newell\u2019s Inkfish ocean-exploration research organization. It currently holds the records for the deepest crewed dives in all five oceans. \nLimiting Factor was commissioned by Victor Vescovo for $37 million and operated by his marine research organization, Caladan Oceanic, between 2018-2022. It is commercially certified by DNV for dives to full ocean depth, and is operated by a pilot, with facilities for an observer.\nThe vessel was used in the Five Deeps Expedition, becoming the first crewed submersible to reach the deepest point in all five oceans. Over 21 people have visited Challenger Deep, the deepest area on Earth, in the DSV. Limiting Factor was used to identify the wrecks of the destroyers USS Johnston at a depth of 6,469 m (21,224 ft), and USS Samuel B. Roberts at 6,865 m (22,523 ft), in the Philippine Trench, the deepest dives on wrecks. It has also been used for dives to the French submarine Minerve (S647) at about 2,350 m (7,710 ft) in the Mediterranean sea, and RMS Titanic at about 3,800 m (12,500 ft) in the Atlantic.\n\n\n== Design and construction ==\nThe submersible is based on a spherical titanium pressure hull for two occupants, seated side by side, which has three wide angle acrylic viewports in front of the crew, one in front of each seat, and one below and between them. If the bow is defined as the side in which the viewports are mounted, the vessel is wider than it is long.\nThe vessel is equipped with a manipulator arm on the starboard side of the pressure hull, a system to drop ballast, and a cluster of five, fixed direction, ducted propeller, marine thrusters at each of the port and starboard ends of the outer hull for propulsion and maneuvering, as can be seen in the photographs. These thrusters provide three axis translational motion and two axis (yaw and roll) rotation.\nThe vessel is commercially certified for unlimited full ocean depth operations by DNV GL.\nThe Limiting Factor normally operates from a dedicated support vessel, DSSV Pressure Drop, but can also be operated from other suitably equipped vessels.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Specifications ===\n\n\n==== Operational limits ====\nThe designed operational maximum dive depth of 11,000 m (36,000 ft) represents approximate full ocean depth \u2013 the maximum depth of the ocean of Earth. Test pressure of 14,000 msw (46,000 fsw, 1,400 bar, 20,000 psi) provides a safety margin. The vessel has been certified to a preliminary maximum diving depth of 10,925 \u00b1 6.5 m (35,843 \u00b1 21 ft) by DNV, based on data from the deepest dive. The vessel is commercially rated for repeated dives to full ocean depth.\n\n\n==== Principal dimensions ====\nThe vessel is unusual in that it can travel on three primary axes, and in practice does a large amount of traveling vertically. If one uses the direction in which the occupants look out on the surroundings through physical windows to define the bow, it is wider than it is long. Alternatively it may be considered to have a bow at either end of the long axis, depending on the direction of motion at the time, like a proa. The long horizontal axis is 4.6 m (15 ft), while the short horizontal axis extent is only 1.9 m (6 ft 3 in). The height is 3.7 m (12 ft).\n\n\n==== Masses, weights and volumes ====\nMass = 12,500 kg (27,600 lb)\nDry weight = 11,700 kg (25,800 lb)\nVariable ballast = up to 500 kg (1,100 lb) dive weights, and 100 kg (220 lb) trim weights\nPayload = approximately 220 kg (490 lb)\nThe vessel is operated by a pilot, and has seating for an observer\n\n\n==== Buoyancy ====\nSurface ballast = 2,150 L (76 cu ft)\nSyntactic foam buoyancy is used\n\n\n==== Structure ====\nThe pressure hull is a 1,500 mm (59 in) inside diameter by 90 mm (3.5 in) thick grade 5 titanium (Ti-6Al-4V ELI) alloy sphere machined to within 99.933% of spherical (for enh\nThe Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest of Earth's five oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south, and is bounded by the continents of Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.\nAt 165,250,000 square kilometers (63,800,000 square miles) in area (as defined with a southern Antarctic border), this largest division of the World Ocean and the hydrosphere covers about 46% of Earth's water surface and about 32% of the planet's total surface area, larger than its entire land area (148,000,000 km2 (57,000,000 sq mi)). The centers of both the Water Hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere, as well as the oceanic pole of inaccessibility, are in the Pacific Ocean. Ocean circulation (caused by the Coriolis effect) subdivides it into two largely independent volumes of water that meet at the equator, the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean (or more loosely the South Seas). The Pacific Ocean can also be informally divided by the International Date Line into the East Pacific and the West Pacific, which allows it to be further divided into four quadrants, namely the Northeast Pacific off the coasts of North America, the Southeast Pacific off South America, Northwest Pacific off Far Eastern/Pacific Asia, and the Southwest Pacific around Oceania.\nThe Pacific Ocean's mean depth is 4,000 meters (13,000 feet). Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, located in the northwestern Pacific, is the deepest known point in the world, reaching a depth of 10,928 meters (35,853 feet). The Pacific also contains the deepest point in the Southern Hemisphere, the Horizon Deep in the Tonga Trench, at 10,823 meters (35,509 feet). The third deepest point on Earth, the Sirena Deep, is also located in the Mariana Trench.\nThe western Pacific has many major marginal seas, including the Philippine Sea, South China Sea, East China Sea, Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Mar de Grau, Tasman Sea, and the Coral Sea.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn the early 16th century, Spanish explorer Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama in 1513 and sighted the great \"Southern Sea\" which he named Mar del Sur (in Spanish). Afterwards, the ocean's current name was coined by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan during the Spanish circumnavigation of the world in 1521, as he encountered favorable winds on reaching the ocean. He called it Mar Pac\u00edfico, which in Portuguese means 'peaceful sea'.\n\n\n== Largest seas in the Pacific Ocean ==\n\nTop large seas:\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nAcross the continents of Asia, Australia and the Americas, more than 25,000 islands, large and small, rise above the surface of the Pacific Ocean. Multiple islands were the shells of former active volcanoes that have lain dormant for thousands of years. Close to the equator, without vast areas of blue ocean, are a dot of atolls that have over intervals of time been formed by seamounts as a result of tiny coral islands strung in a ring within surroundings of a central lagoon.\n\n\n=== Early migrations ===\n\nImportant human migrations occurred in the Pacific in prehistoric times. Modern humans first reached the western Pacific in the Paleolithic, at around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago. Originating from a southern coastal human migration out of Africa, they reached East Asia, Mainland Southeast Asia, the Philippines, New Guinea, and then Australia by making the sea crossing of at least 80 kilometres (50 mi) between Sundaland and Sahul. It is not known with any certainty what level of maritime technology was used by these groups \u2013 the presumption is that they used large bamboo rafts which may have been equipped with some sort of sail. The reduction in favourable winds for a crossing to Sahul after 58,000 B.P. fits with the dating of the settlement of Australia, with no later migrations in the prehistoric period. The seafaring abilities of pre-Austronesian resi\nThe Pharaoh's daughter is a figure in the Hebrew Bible who is described as marrying Solomon to cement a political alliance between the United Monarchy of Israel  and Egypt.\n\n\n== Biblical narrative ==\nWhile there is no archaeological evidence of a marriage between an Egyptian princess, the daughter of a Pharaoh, and a king of united Israel, claims of one are made at several places in the Hebrew Bible. \n(Note: All scripture quotes are taken from the 1917 Jewish Publication Society Bible, now in the public domain.)\n\n\n=== A marriage alliance ===\n1 Kings 3:1 says,\n\"And Solomon became allied to Pharaoh king of Egypt by marriage, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.\"\nThe fact that Pharaoh's daughter has been singled out in the accounts of Solomon is significant as similar treatment is not given to his \"seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines\" (1 Kings 11:3). Some scholars believe this unique example was because this marriage in particular \"demonstrates the wealth and power of the Hebrew monarchy, for Pharaoh's daughters did not ordinarily marry outside of their own family, and perhaps indicates the weakness of the Egyptian kingdom at this time.\" Another scholar points out that marrying Pharaoh's daughter is significant in light of the story of Exodus, \"A descendant of former Egyptian slaves now became Pharaoh's son-in-law\". Most scholars believe the alliance was a result of the reputation of Solomon's father, \"Under David, Israel had become a factor to be reckoned with in Eastern politics, and the Pharaoh found it prudent to secure its friendship.\" The alliance through marriage is seen by scholars as the reason for the reported increase in trade with Egypt at 1 Kings 10:28\u201329.\n\n\n=== City of Gezer as dowry ===\n\nThe narrative says that the Canaanite city of Gezer had never fallen before the Israelites from Joshua to David.\n\nJoshua 16:10 \"And they drove not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in the midst of Ephraim, unto this day, and became servants to do taskwork.\"\nJudges 1:29 \"And Ephraim drove not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.\"\n2 Samuel 5:25 \"And David did so, as the Lord commanded him, and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gezer.\"\nThis situation changed when the Egyptian army invaded the city, ethnically cleansed the populace, and Pharaoh turned it over to his daughter as a wedding gift, whereby it became the property of Israel.\n\n1 Kings 9:16\n\"Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a portion unto his daughter, Solomon's wife.\"\n1 Kings 9:17 shows that Gezer \"was now rebuilt and made a fortified city of Solomon.\"\nThe historian Josephus gives a similar account in his Antiquities of the Jews, Bk 8, Ch 6, Sec. 1:\n\n\"...he [Solomon] also built cities which might be counted among the strongest, Asor [Hazor] and Magedo [Megiddo], and the third Gazara [Gezer], which had indeed belonged to the Philistines; but Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, had made an expedition against it, and besieged it, and taken it by force; and when he had slain all its inhabitants, he utterly overthrew it, and gave it as a present to his daughter, who had been married to Solomon; for which reason the king rebuilt it, as a city that was naturally strong, and might be useful in wars, and the mutations of affairs that sometimes happen. Moreover, he built two other cities not far from it, Betchora [Beth-horon] was the name of one of them, and Beleth [Baalath] of the other. He also built other cities that lay conveniently for these, in order to the enjoyment of pleasures and delicacies in them, such as were naturally of a good temperature of the air, and agreeable for fruits ripe in their proper seasons, \nDeepsea Challenger (DCV 1) is a 7.3-metre (24 ft) deep-diving submersible designed to reach the bottom of the Challenger Deep, the deepest-known point on Earth. On 26 March 2012, Canadian film director James Cameron piloted the craft to accomplish this goal in the second crewed dive reaching the Challenger Deep. Built in Sydney, Australia, by the research and design company Acheron Project Pty Ltd, Deepsea Challenger includes scientific sampling equipment and high-definition 3-D cameras; it reached the ocean's deepest point after two hours and 36 minutes of descent from the surface.\n\n\n== Development ==\nDeepsea Challenger was built in Australia, in partnership with the National Geographic Society and with support from Rolex, in the Deepsea Challenge program. The construction of the submersible was headed by Australian engineer Ron Allum. Many of the submersible developer team members hail from Sydney's cave-diving fraternity including Allum himself with many years of cave-diving experience.\nWorking in a small engineering workshop in Leichhardt, Sydney, Allum created new materials including a specialized structural syntactic foam called Isofloat, capable of withstanding the huge compressive forces at the 11-kilometre (6.8 mi) depth. The new foam is unique in that it is more homogeneous and possesses greater uniform strength than other commercially available syntactic foam yet, with a specific density of about 0.7, will float in water. The foam is composed of very small hollow glass spheres suspended in an epoxy resin and comprises about 70% of the submersible's volume.\nThe foam's strength enabled the Deepsea Challenger designers to incorporate thruster motors as part of the infrastructure mounted within the foam but without the aid of a steel skeleton to mount various mechanisms. The foam supersedes gasoline-filled tanks for flotation as used in the historic bathyscaphe Trieste.\nAllum also built many innovations, necessary to overcome the limitations of existing products (and presently undergoing development for other deep sea vehicles). These include pressure-balanced oil-filled thrusters; LED lighting arrays; new types of cameras; and fast, reliable penetration communication cables allowing transmissions through the hull of the submersible. Allum gained much of his experience developing the electronic communication used in Cameron's Titanic dives in filming Ghosts of the Abyss, Bismarck and others.\nPower systems for the submarine were supplied by lithium batteries that were housed within the foam and can be clearly seen through clear plastic panels. The lithium battery charging systems were designed by Ron Allum. \nThe submersible contains over 180 onboard systems, including batteries, thrusters, life support, 3D cameras, and LED lighting. These interconnected systems are monitored and controlled by a programmable logic controller (PLC) from Temecula, California-based controls manufacturer Opto 22. During dives, the control system also recorded depth, heading, temperature, pressure, battery status, and other data, and sent it to the support ship at three-minute intervals via an underwater acoustic communication system developed by West Australian company L-3 Nautronix.\nThe crucial structural elements, such as the backbone and pilot sphere that carried Cameron, were engineered by the Tasmanian company Finite Elements. The design of the interior of the sphere, including fireproofing, condensation management and mounting of control assemblies, was undertaken by Sydney-based industrial design consultancy Design + Industry.\n\n\n== Specifications ==\nThe submersible features a pilot sphere, large enough for only one occupant. The sphere, with steel walls 64 mm (2.5 in) thick, was tested for its ability to withstand the required 114 megapascals (16,500 pounds per square inch) of pressure in a pressure chamber at Pennsylvania State University. The sphere sits at the base of the 11.8-tonne (13.0-short-ton) vehicle. The vehicle operates in \nA deep-submergence vehicle (DSV) is a deep-diving crewed submersible that is self-propelled. Several navies operate vehicles that can be accurately described as DSVs. DSVs are commonly divided into two types: research DSVs, which are used for exploration and surveying, and DSRVs (deep-submergence rescue vehicles), which are intended to be used for rescuing the crew of a sunken navy submarine, clandestine (espionage) missions (primarily installing wiretaps on undersea communications cables), or both. DSRVs are equipped with docking chambers to allow personnel ingress and egress via a manhole.\nStrictly speaking, bathyscaphes are not submarines because they have minimal mobility and are built like a balloon, using a habitable spherical pressure vessel hung under a liquid hydrocarbon filled float drum. In a DSV/DSRV, the passenger compartment and the ballast tank functionality is incorporated into a single structure to afford more habitable space (up to 24 people in the case of a DSRV).\nMost DSV/DSRV vehicles are powered by traditional electric battery propulsion and have very limited endurance, while a few (like NR-1 or AS-12/31) are/were nuclear-powered, and could sustain much longer missions. Plans have been made to equip DSVs with LOX Stirling engines, but none have been realized so far due to cost and maintenance considerations. All DSVs to date (2023) are dependent on a surface support ship or a mother submarine that can piggyback or tow them (in case of the NR-1) to the scene of operations. Some DSRV vessels are air transportable in very large military cargo planes to speed up deployment in case of emergency rescue missions.\n\n\n== List of deep submergence vehicles ==\n\n\n=== Trieste-class bathyscaphes ===\nFNRS-2\nThe first bathyscaphe, developed by Swiss engineer Auguste Piccard and named after the Belgian Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS), the funding organization for the venture. FNRS also funded the FNRS-1, a balloon that set a world altitude record, also built by Piccard. This bathyscaphe consisted of a gasoline filled float, 22 feet long and 10 feet wide, and oval shaped. Gasoline being less dense than water, would provide buoyancy for when the bathyscaphe needed to rise to the surface. The ovular float was divided into six tanks for holding gasoline, having a combined total of 6,600 gallons.\nFNRS-3\nAfter damage to the FNRS-2 during its sea trials in 1948, the FNRS ran out of funding and the submersible was sold to the French Navy in 1950. It was subsequently substantially rebuilt and improved at Toulon naval base, and renamed FNRS-3. It was relaunched in 1953 under the command of Georges Houot, a French naval officer.\nDSV-0 Trieste\nThe X-1 Trieste bathyscaphe has reached Challenger Deep, the world's deepest seabed. It was retired in 1966.\nDSV-1 X-2 Trieste II\nAn updated bathyscaphe design, it participated in clandestine missions. Trieste II was retired in 1984.\n\n\n=== Alvin-class submersibles ===\nOriginally designed for 6,000 ft (1,800 m) operation, and initially built to a similar design, Alvin and her sister submersibles have been subsequently, independently upgraded.  Utilizing syntactic foam, these submersibles were more compact and maneuverable than earlier bathyscaphes like Trieste, although not as deep diving.\n\nDSV-2 Alvin\nLaunched in June 1964 with an initial depth capability of 6,000 ft (1,800 m); rebuilt in 1973 to 4,500 m (14,800 ft). Owned by the United States Navy and operated under secondment by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) where it conducts science-oriented missions funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Office of Naval Research (ONR). Alvin operates from R/V Atlantis, an AGOR-23 class vessel owned by the ONR and operated by WHOI under a charter party agreement. In 2004, the National Science Foundation funded a 6,500 m (21,300 ft) capable replacement for Alvin, however the key components, such as a ne\nThe Ionian Sea (Modern Greek: \u0399\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf \u03a0\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, romanized: I\u00f3nio P\u00e9lagos, IPA: [i\u02c8oni.o \u02c8pela\u0263os]; Italian: Mar Ionio or Mar Jonio, IPA: [mar \u02c8j\u0254\u02d0njo]; Albanian: Deti Jon, IPA: [\u02c8d\u025bti \u02c8j\u0254n]) is an elongated bay of the Mediterranean Sea. It is connected to the Adriatic Sea to the north, and is bounded by Southern Italy, including Basilicata, Calabria, Sicily, and the Salento peninsula to the west, southern Albania (and western Apulia, Italy) to the north, and the west coast of Greece, including the Peloponnese.\nAll major islands in the sea, which are located in the east of the sea, belong to Greece. They are collectively named the Ionian Islands, the main ones being Corfu, Kefalonia, Zakynthos, Lefkada, and Ithaca.\nThere are ferry routes between Patras and Igoumenitsa, Greece, and Brindisi and Ancona, Italy, that cross the east and north of the Ionian Sea, and from Piraeus westward. Calypso Deep, the deepest point in the Mediterranean at 5,109 m (16,762 ft), is in the Ionian Sea, at 36\u00b034\u2032N 21\u00b08\u2032E. The sea is one of the most seismically active areas in the world.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name Ionian comes from the Greek word Ionion (\u1f38\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd). Its etymology is unknown. Ancient Greek writers, especially Aeschylus, linked it to the myth of Io. In ancient Greek the adjective Ionios (\u1f38\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2) was used as an epithet for the sea because Io swam across it. According to the Oxford Classical Dictionary, the name may derive from Ionians who sailed to the West, however the word for Ionians is spelled with an omega ( \u1f3c\u03c9\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2) rather than an omicron as in the word for the Ionian Sea. There were also narratives about other eponymic legendary figures; according to one version, Ionius was a son of Adrias (eponymic for the Adriatic Sea); according to another, Ionius was a son of Dyrrhachus. When Dyrrhachus was attacked by his own brothers, Heracles, who was passing through the area, came to his aid, but in the fight the hero killed his ally's son by mistake. The body was cast into the water, and thereafter was called the Ionian Sea. \nCham Albanians used to call the Ionian sea \"The Lady's Domain\".\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Extent ===\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Ionian Sea as follows:\n\nOn the North.

It is bounded by the Greater Antilles to the north from Cuba to Puerto Rico, the Lesser Antilles to the east from the Virgin Islands to Trinidad and Tobago, South America to the south from the Venezuelan coastline to the Colombian coastline, and Central America and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula to the west from Panama to Mexico. The geopolitical region centered around the Caribbean Sea, including the numerous islands of the West Indies and adjacent coastal areas in the mainland of the Americas, is known as the Caribbean. \nThe Caribbean Sea is one of the largest seas on Earth and has an area of about 2,754,000 km2 (1,063,000 sq mi). The sea's deepest point is the Cayman Trough, between the Cayman Islands and Jamaica, at 7,686 m (25,217 ft) below sea level. The Caribbean coastline has many gulfs and bays: the Gulf of Gon\u00e2ve, the Gulf of Venezuela, the Gulf of Dari\u00e9n, Golfo de los Mosquitos, the Gulf of Paria and the Gulf of Honduras.\n\nThe Caribbean Sea has the world's second-largest barrier reef, the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef. It runs 1,000 km (620 mi) along the Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras coasts.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe name Caribbean derives from the Caribs, one of the region's dominant native people at the time of European contact during the late 15th century. After Christopher Columbus landed in The Bahamas in 1492 and later discovered some of the islands in The Caribbean, the Spanish term Antillas applied to the lands; stemming from this, the Sea of the Antilles became a common alternative name for the \"Caribbean Sea\" in various European languages. Spanish dominance in the region remained undisputed during the first century of European colonization.\nFrom the 16th century, Europeans visiting the Caribbean region distinguished the \"South Sea\" (the Pacific Ocean south of the isthmus of Panama) from the \"North Sea\" (the Caribbean Sea north of the same isthmus).\n\nThe Caribbean Sea had been unknown to the populations of Eurasia until after 1492 when Christopher Columbus sailed into Caribbean waters to find a sea route to Asia. At that time, the Americas were generally unknown to most Europeans, although they had been visited in the 10th century by the Vikings. Following Columbus's discovery of the islands, the area was quickly colonized by several Western cultures (initially Spain, then later England, the Dutch Republic, France, Courland and Denmark). Following the colonization of the Caribbean islands, the Caribbean Sea became a busy area for European-based marine trading and transports. This commerce eventually attracted pirates such as Samuel Bellamy and Blackbeard.\nAs of 2015 the area is home to 22 island territories and borders 12 continental countries.\n\n\n== Extent ==\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Caribbean Sea as follows:\n\nOn the North.

In the Mona Passage \u2013 a line joining Cape Enga\u00f1o and the extreme of Agujereada (18\u00b031\u2032N 67\u00b008\u2032W) in Puerto Rico.\n\nEastern limits. From Point San Diego (Puerto Rico) Northward along the meridian thereof (65\u00b039\u2032W) to the 100-fathom line, thence Eastward and Southward, in such a manner that all islands, shoals and narrow waters of the Lesser Antilles are included in the Caribbean Sea as far as but not including Trinidad. From before Trinidad to Baja Point (9\u00b032\u2032N 61\u00b00\u2032W) in Venezuela.\nAlthough Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados are on the same continental shelf, they are considered to be in the Atlantic Ocean rather than in the Caribbean Sea.\n\n\n== Geology ==\nThe Caribbean Sea is an oceanic sea on the Caribbean Plate. The Caribbean Sea is separated from the ocean by several island arcs of various ages. The youngest stretches from the Lesser Antilles to the Virgin Islands to north of Tri\nThe Arabian Sea (Arabic: \u0628\u064e\u062d\u0631\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u0652, romanized: ba\u1e25r al-\u02bfarab) is a region of sea in the northern Indian Ocean, bounded on the west by the Arabian Peninsula, Gulf of Aden and Guardafui Channel, on the northwest by Gulf of Oman and Iran, on the north by Pakistan, on the east by India, and on the southeast by the Laccadive Sea and the Maldives, on the southwest by Somalia. Its total area is 3,862,000 km2 (1,491,000 sq mi) and its maximum depth is 5,395 meters (17,700 feet). The Gulf of Aden in the west connects the Arabian Sea to the Red Sea through the strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, and the Gulf of Oman is in the northwest, connecting it to the Persian Gulf.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Arabian Sea's surface area is about 3,862,000 km2 (1,491,130 sq mi). The maximum width of the sea is approximately 2,400 km (1,490 mi), and its maximum depth is 5,395 metres (17,700 ft). The biggest river flowing into the sea is the Indus River.\nThe Arabian Sea has two important branches: the Gulf of Aden in the southwest, connecting with the Red Sea through the strait of Bab-el-Mandeb; and the Gulf of Oman to the northwest, connecting with the Persian Gulf. There are also the gulfs of Khambhat and Kutch on the Indian Coast.\nThe Arabian Sea has been crossed by many important marine trade routes since the 3rd or 2nd millennium BCE. Major seaports include Kandla Port, Mundra Port, Pipavav Port, Dahej Port, Hazira Port, Mumbai Port, Nhava Sheva Port (Navi Mumbai), Mormug\u00e3o Port (Goa), New Mangalore Port and Kochi Port in India, the Port of Karachi, Port Qasim, and the Gwadar Port in Pakistan, Chabahar Port in Iran and the Port of Salalah in Salalah, Oman. The largest islands in the Arabian Sea include Socotra (Yemen), Masirah Island (Oman), Lakshadweep (India) and Astola Island (Pakistan).\nThe countries with coastlines on the Arabian Sea are Yemen, Oman, Pakistan, Iran, India and the Maldives.\n\n\n=== Limits ===\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Arabian Sea as follows:\n\nOn the west: the eastern limit of the Gulf of Aden.\nOn the north: a line joining R\u00e0s al Hadd, east point of the Arabian Peninsula (22\u00b032'N) and R\u00e0s Jiy\u00f9ni (61\u00b043'E) on the coast of Pakistan.\nOn the south: a line running from the southern extremity of Addu Atoll in the Maldives, to the eastern extremity of R\u00e0s Hafun (the easternmost point of Africa, 10\u00b026'N).\nOn the east: the western limit of the Laccadive Sea a line running from Sadashivgad on the west coast of India (14\u00b048\u2032N 74\u00b007\u2032E) to Cora Divh (13\u00b042\u2032N 72\u00b010\u2032E) and thence down the west side of the Laccadive and Maldive archipelagos to the most southerly point of Addu Atoll in the Maldives.\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\nThe International Indian Ocean Expedition in 1959 was among the first to perform hydrographic surveys of the Arabian Sea. Significant bathymetric surveys were also conducted by the Soviet Union during the 1960s.\n\n\n==== Hydrographic features ====\nSignificant features in the northern Arabian Sea include the Indus Fan, the second largest fan system in the world. The De Covilhao Trough, named after the 15th century Portuguese explorer Pero de Covilh\u0103o, reaches depths of 4,400 metres (14,436 ft) and separates the Indus Fan region from the Oman Abyssal Plain, which eventually leads to the Gulf of Oman.\nThe southern limits are dominated by the Arabian Basin, a deep basin reaching depths over 4,200 metres (13,780 ft). The northern sections of the Carlsberg Ridge flank the southern edge of the Arabian Basin.\nThe deepest parts of the Arabian Sea are in the Alula-Fartak Trough on the western edge of the Arabian Sea off the Gulf of Aden. The trough, reaching depths over 5,360 metres (17,585 ft), traverses the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea. The deepest known point is in the Arabian Sea limits at a depth of 5,395 metres (17,700 ft). Other significant deep points are part of the Arabian Basin, which include a 5,358 metres (17,579 ft) deep point off the northern limit of Calrsberg Ridge.\n\n\n==== Seamounts ====\nThe Mediterranean Sea ( MED-ih-t\u0259-RAY-nee-\u0259n) is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, on the east by the Levant in West Asia, and on the west almost by the Morocco\u2013Spain border. The Mediterranean has played a central role in the history of Western civilization. Geological evidence indicates that around 5.9 million years ago, the Mediterranean was cut off from the Atlantic and was partly or completely desiccated over a period of some 600,000 years during the Messinian salinity crisis before being refilled by the Zanclean flood about 5.3 million years ago.\nThe Mediterranean Sea covers an area of about 2,500,000 km2 (970,000 sq mi), representing 0.7% of the global ocean surface, but its connection to the Atlantic via the Strait of Gibraltar\u2014the narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and separates the Iberian Peninsula in Europe from Morocco in Africa\u2014is only 14 km (9 mi) wide. The Mediterranean Sea encompasses a vast number of islands, some of them of volcanic origin. The two largest islands, in both area and population, are Sicily and Sardinia.\nThe Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500 m (4,900 ft) and the deepest recorded point is 5,109 \u00b1 1 m (16,762 \u00b1 3 ft) in the Calypso Deep in the Ionian Sea. It lies between latitudes 30\u00b0 and 46\u00b0 N and longitudes 6\u00b0 W and 36\u00b0 E. Its west\u2013east length, from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Gulf of Alexandretta, on the southeastern coast of Turkey, is about 4,000 kilometres (2,500 mi). The north\u2013south length varies greatly between different shorelines and whether only straight routes are considered. Also including longitudinal changes, the shortest shipping route between the multinational Gulf of Trieste and the Libyan coastline of the Gulf of Sidra is about 1,900 kilometres (1,200 mi). The water temperatures are mild in winter and warm in summer and give name to the Mediterranean climate type due to the majority of precipitation falling in the cooler months. Its southern and eastern coastlines are lined with hot deserts not far inland, but the immediate coastline on all sides of the Mediterranean tends to have strong maritime moderation.\nThe sea was an important route for merchants and travellers of ancient times, facilitating trade and cultural exchange between the peoples of the region. The history of the Mediterranean region is crucial to understanding the origins and development of many modern societies. The Roman Empire maintained nautical hegemony over the sea for centuries and is the only state to have ever controlled all of its coast.\nThe countries surrounding the Mediterranean and its marginal seas in clockwise order are Spain, France, Monaco, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Greece, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco; Malta and Cyprus are island countries in the sea. In addition, two overseas territories of the United Kingdom, Gibraltar and Akrotiri and Dhekelia, have coastlines on the Mediterranean. The drainage basin encompasses a large number of other countries, the Nile being the longest river ending in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe Ancient Egyptians called the Mediterranean Wadj-wr/Wadj-Wer/Wadj-Ur. This term (literally \"great green\") was the name given by the Ancient Egyptians to the semi-solid, semi-aquatic region characterized by papyrus forests to the north of the cultivated Nile delta, and, by extension, the sea beyond.\nThe Ancient Greeks called the Mediterranean simply \u1f21 \u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 (h\u0113 th\u00e1lassa; \"the Sea\") or sometimes \u1f21 \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 (h\u0113 meg\u00e1l\u0113 th\u00e1lassa; \"the Great Sea\"), \u1f21 \u1f21\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 \u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 (h\u0113 h\u0113met\u00e9r\u0101 th\u00e1lassa; \"Our Sea\"), or \u1f21 \u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 \u1f21 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u2019 \u1f21\u03bc\u1fb6\u03c2 (h\u0113 th\u00e1lassa h\u0113 kath\u2019h\u0113m\u00e2s; \"the sea around us\").\nThe Romans called it Mare Magnum (\"Great Sea\") or Mare Internum (\"Int\nThe Dead Sea (Arabic: \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u064a\u0650\u0651\u062a, romanized: al-Ba\u1e25r al-Mayyit, or \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u064a\u0652\u062a, al-Ba\u1e25r al-Mayt; Hebrew: \u05d9\u05b7\u05dd \u05d4\u05b7\u05de\u05b6\u05bc\u05dc\u05b7\u05d7, romanized: Yam hamMela\u1e25), also known by other names, is a landlocked salt lake bordered by Jordan to the east, the Israeli-occupied West Bank to the west and Israel to the southwest. It lies in the Jordan Rift Valley, and its main tributary is the Jordan River.\nAs of 2019, the lake's surface is 430.5 metres (1,412 ft) below sea level, making its shores the lowest land-based elevation on Earth. It is 304 m (997 ft) deep, the deepest hypersaline lake in the world. With a salinity of 342 g/kg, or 34.2% (in 2011), it is one of the world's saltiest bodies of water \u2013 9.6 times as salty as the ocean \u2013 and has a density of 1.24 kg/litre, which makes swimming similar to floating. This salinity makes for a harsh environment in which plants and animals cannot flourish, hence its name. The Dead Sea's main, northern basin is 50 kilometres (31 mi) long and 15 kilometres (9 mi) wide at its widest point.\nThe Dead Sea has attracted visitors from around the Mediterranean Basin for thousands of years. It was one of the world's first health resorts, and it has been the supplier of a wide variety of products, from asphalt for Egyptian mummification to potash for fertilisers. Today, tourists visit the sea on its Israeli, Jordanian and West Bank coastlines.\nThe Dead Sea is receding at a swift rate; its surface area today is 605 km2 (234 sq mi), having been 1,050 km2 (410 sq mi) in 1930. Multiple canal and pipeline proposals, such as the scrapped Red Sea\u2013Dead Sea Water Conveyance project, have been made to reduce its recession.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe English name \"Dead Sea\" is a calque of the Arabic name, itself a calque of earlier Greek and Latin names, in reference to the scarcity of aquatic life caused by the lake's extreme salinity.\nHistorical English names include the Salt Sea, Lake of Sodom from the biblical account of its destruction and Lake Asphaltites from Greek and Latin.\nThe name \"Dead Sea\" occasionally appears in Hebrew literature as Y\u0101m HamM\u0101vet (\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea), 'Sea of Death'.\nThe usual biblical and modern Hebrew name for the lake is the Sea of Salt (\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05de\u05dc\u05d7, ). Other Hebrew names for the lake also mentioned in the Bible are the Sea of Arabah (\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05e2\u05e8\u05d1\u05d4, Y\u0101m Ha\u2018\u0102r\u0101v\u00e2) and the Eastern Sea (\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05e7\u05d3\u05de\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9, HaY\u0101m HaQadm\u014dn\u00ee).\nThe Arabic name is  (\u200f\u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u062a\u200e), or usually without the article al-, so just Bahr etc.\nIt is also known in Arabic as the Sea of Lot (\u200f\u0628\u062d\u0631 \u0644\u0648\u0637\u200e, Buhayrat, Bahret, or Birket Lut) from the nephew of Abraham whose wife was said to have turned into a pillar of salt during the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Less often, it has been known in Arabic as the Sea of Zo'ar from a formerly important city along its shores.\nBecause of the large volume of ancient trade in the lake's naturally occurring free-floating bitumen, its usual names in ancient Greek and Roman geography were some form of Asphalt Lake (Greek: \u1f08\u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03c4\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 or \u1f08\u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03c4\u03af\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u039b\u03af\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7, Asphalt\u00edt\u0113s or Asphalt\u00edtis L\u00edmn\u0113; Latin: Lacus Asphaltites) or Sea (\u1f08\u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03c4\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0398\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1, Asphalt\u00edt\u0113s Th\u00e1lassa).\nIt was also known as the 'Dead Sea' (Greek \u039d\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac \u0398\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1, Nekr\u00e1 Th\u00e1lassa, Latin (Mare Mortuum).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Dead Sea is a salt lake is bordered by Jordan to the east and Palestine's Israeli-occupied West Bank and Israel to the west. It is an endorheic lake, meaning there are no outlet streams.\nThe Dead Sea lies in the Jordan Rift Valley, a geographic feature formed by the Dead Sea Transform (DST). This left lateral-moving transform fault lies along the tectonic plate boundary between the African Plate and the Arabian Plate. It runs between the East Anatolian Fault zone in Turkey and the northern end of the Red Sea Rift offshore of the southern tip of Sinai.\nWater feeds into the Dead Sea from various sources, many small or intermittent, including:\n\nJordan River, international border from the north\nArava Stream (Wadi Arava), international border fr\nStephen Keenan (1 December 1977 \u2013 22 July 2017) was an Irish freediving safety diver and co-owner at Dahab Freedivers. He held several Irish national freediving records and was a Chief of Safety\nat various freediving events such as Vertical Blue Freediving Competitions.\nKeenan died during a rescue in an attempt to assist freediver Alessia Zecchini to the surface from a depth of 50 metres in Dahab's Blue Hole in 2017. It was the first recorded death of a safety diver in action in freediving history.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nStephen Keenan was born and raised in Glasnevin, near Dublin, Ireland. He had studied microbiology at Trinity College, but had lived for about eight years in Egypt, where he was a freedive instructor.\nKeenan discovered freediving while he was holidaying in Dahab, Egypt in 2009. He later relocated to Dahab, became a freediving instructor, and trained hundreds of students in Egypt, Spain, and the Philippines. In 2015, Keenan co-founded Dahab Freedivers with fellow freedivers Miguel Lozano and Pascal Berger. That same year, he attained his career-best dive with a monofin to 81 metres (267 feet).\n\n\n== Death ==\nOn 22 July 2017, Keenan died while assisting a dive by Alessia Zecchini. Zecchini was attempting to cross the Blue Hole on a single breath, but became disorientated when Keenan was 20 seconds late to arrive at a meeting point. She swam astray but reached the surface after Keenan reached her to resume guiding. Keenan, though, lost consciousness and was found floating face down nearby. Despite repeated attempts to save his life, he could not be revived.\nAccording to the Irish Independent, \"Keenan suffered an in-water blackout in the last 10 meters of the ascent. He was alive when he was recovered from the water but died a short time later.\"\n\n\n== The Deepest Breath ==\nThe Deepest Breath is a 2023 documentary directed by Laura McGann. The film tells the story of Alessia Zecchini and Keenan, covering their relationship, careers in the sport, and Keenan's death.\n\n\n== References ==\nThe New Britain Trench (also known as Bougainville-New Britain Trench or New Britain-Solomon Trench) has formed due to subduction of the floor of the Solomon Sea and has some of the highest current seismic activity in the world. \nThe trench was discovered by the German research vessel SMS Planet, in 1910.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe trench is 840 km (520 mi) long, curved around the south of New Britain and west of Bougainville Island in the northern Solomon Sea. The deepest point is the Planet Deep at 9,140 m (29,990 ft). \n\n\n=== Tectonics ===\nThe New Britain subduction zone is a continuum with the Vanuatu subduction zone and are all cases of subduction polarity reversal as originally the Pacific Plate subducted under the Indo-Australian Plate's minor plates such as the North Bismarck Plate. However now minor plate subduction is associated with the Australian Plate subducting under the Pacific Plate. In this case it is the Solomon Sea Plate and Trobriand Plate subducting under the South Bismarck Plate. It is possible that the collision to the west of the 30\u201335 km (19\u201322 mi) thick Ontong Java Plateau with the Vitiaz Trench from about 25 million years ago initiated this polarity reversal. The rates of subduction and roll back are high and are currently for the New Britain Trench, a subduction velocity of 65\u2013120 cm/year (26\u201347 in/year), a convergence velocity of 2\u201348 cm/year (0.79\u201318.90 in/year), and spreading deformation rate in its arc-back-\narc area of 10\u201374 cm/year (3.9\u201329.1 in/year).\nIn various parts of the trench there is up to 18 cm/year (7.1 in/year) of trench roll back and 20 cm/year (7.9 in/year) of trench advance.\n\n\n=== Associated seismicity ===\nThe New Britain subduction zone is extremely seismically active and has had more than 22 earthquakes with magnitudes equal to or larger than 7.5 since 1990.\n\n\n=== Associated volcanism ===\nThere is quite active arc volcanism with for example the active Rabaul Caldera area in the north east of New Britain  having had a recent series of euptions in 1994 that destroyed the port of Rabaul.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nThe diversity of life forms discovered living on top of the trench floor sediments and scavenging communities is high,   with during one study at 1 km (0.62 mi) depth 35 species observed, with biodiversity decreasing at 3.7 km (2.3 mi) depth before increasing again at 8.2 km (5.1 mi). This is likely to reflect several factors. The trench is situated within the southern West Pacific Warm Pool characterized by sea surface temperature greater than 28\u00b0C and because of its closeness to tropical land, the land is subject to high rain fall. The trench is only 55 km (34 mi) offshore from New Britain with an almost uniform slope into it of about 8\u00b0. Hence there is a very high organic carbon load, sourced more than other trenches from soil organic matter, although marine phytoplankton and a minor contribution from land plants also help.\nSpecies observed at 1 km (0.62 mi) depth included a free swimming Teuthidodrilus (squidworm). and ulmarid jellyfish.\nAt 8.7 km (5.4 mi) depth starfish and shrimps believed to be either of the family Penaeidae or the order Mysida were observed. There were 5 amphipod species including Alicella gigantea. Novel viruses and bacteria have been characterised in the sediment collected at this depth.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nSources\nThe Philippine Sea is a marginal sea of the Western Pacific Ocean east of the Philippine Archipelago (hence the name) and the largest sea in the world, occupying an estimated surface area of 5 million square kilometers (2\u00d710^6 sq mi). The Philippine Sea Plate forms the floor of the sea. Its western border is the first island chain to the west, comprising the Ryukyu Islands in the northwest and Taiwan in the west. Its southwestern border comprises the Philippine islands of Luzon, Catanduanes, Samar, Leyte, and Mindanao. Its northern border comprises the Japanese islands of Honshu, Shikoku and Ky\u016bsh\u016b. Its eastern border is the second island chain to the east, comprising the Bonin Islands and Iwo Jima in the northeast, the Mariana Islands (including Guam, Saipan, and Tinian) in the due east, and Halmahera, Palau, Yap and Ulithi (of the Caroline Islands) in the southeast. Its southern border is Indonesia's Morotai Island.\nThe sea has a complex and diverse undersea relief. The floor is formed into a structural basin by a series of geologic faults and fracture zones. Island arcs, which are actually extended ridges protruding above the ocean surface due to plate tectonic activity in the area, enclose the Philippine Sea to the north, east and south. The Philippine archipelago, Ryukyu Islands, and the Marianas are examples. Another prominent feature of the Philippine Sea is the presence of deep sea trenches, among them the Philippine Trench and the Mariana Trench, containing the deepest point on the planet.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nThe Philippine Sea has the Philippines and Taiwan to the west, Japan to the north, the Marianas to the east and Palau to the south. Adjacent seas include the Celebes Sea which is separated by Mindanao and smaller islands to the south, the South China Sea which is separated by Philippines, and the East China Sea which is separated by the Ryukyu Islands.\n\n\n=== Extent ===\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the Philippine Sea as \"that area of the North Pacific Ocean off the Eastern coasts of the Philippine Islands\", bounded as follows:\n\nOn the west. By the eastern limits of the East Indian Archipelago, South China Sea and East China Sea.\nOn the north. By the southeast coast of Kyushu, the southern and eastern limits of the Inland Sea and the south coast of Honshu Island.\nOn the east.\nBy the ridge joining Japan to the Bonin, Volcano and Ladrone (Mariana) Islands, all these being included in the Philippine Sea.\nOn the south. By a line joining Guam, Yap, Pelew (Palau) and Halmahera Islands.\n\n\n=== Geology ===\n\nThe Philippine Sea Plate forms the floor of the Philippine Sea. It subducts under the Philippine Mobile Belt which carries most of the Philippine archipelago and eastern Taiwan. Between the two plates is the Philippine Trench.\n\n\n=== Marine biodiversity ===\nThe Philippine Sea has a marine territorial scope of over 679,800 square kilometers (262,500 sq mi), and an EEZ of 2.2 million km2. Attributed to an extensive vicariance and island integrations, the Philippines contains the highest number of marine species per unit area relative to the countries within the Indo-Malay-Philippines Archipelago, and has been identified as the epicenter of marine biodiversity. With its inclusion in the Coral Triangle, the Philippine Sea encompasses over 3,212 fish species, 486 coral species, 800 seaweed species, and 820 benthic algae species, wherein the Verde Island Passage is dubbed as \"the center of the center of marine fish biodiversity\". Within its territory, thirty-three endemic species of fish have been identified, including the blue-spotted angelfish (Chaetodontoplus caeruleopunctatus) and the sea catfish (Arius manillensis). The Philippine marine territory has also become a breeding and feeding ground for endangered marine species, such as the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), the dugong (Dugong dugon), and the megamouth shark (Megachasma pelagios).

An endorheic basin, it lies between Europe and Asia: east of the Caucasus, west of the broad steppe of Central Asia, south of the fertile plains of Southern Russia in Eastern Europe, and north of the mountainous Iranian Plateau. It covers a surface area of 371,000 km2 (143,000 sq mi) (excluding the highly saline lagoon of Garabogazk\u00f6l to its east), an area approximately equal to that of Japan, with a volume of 78,200 km3 (19,000 cu mi). It has a salinity of approximately 1.2% (12 g/L), about a third of the salinity of average seawater. It is bounded by Kazakhstan to the northeast, Russia to the northwest, Azerbaijan to the southwest, Iran to the south, and Turkmenistan to the southeast.\nThe sea stretches 1,200 km (750 mi) from north to south, with an average width of 320 km (200 mi). Its gross coverage is 386,400 km2 (149,200 sq mi) and the surface is about 27 m (89 ft) below sea level. Its main freshwater inflow, Europe's longest river, the Volga, enters at the shallow north end. Two deep basins form its central and southern zones. These lead to horizontal differences in temperature, salinity, and ecology. The seabed in the south reaches 1,023 m (3,356 ft) below sea level, which is the third-lowest natural non-oceanic depression on Earth after Baikal and Tanganyika lakes. \nWritten accounts from the ancient inhabitants of its coast perceived the Caspian Sea as an ocean, probably because of its salinity and large size. With a surface area of 371,000 square kilometres (143,000 sq mi), the Caspian Sea is nearly five times as big as Lake Superior (82,000 square kilometres (32,000 sq mi)). The Caspian Sea is home to a wide range of species and is famous for its caviar and oil industries. Pollution from the oil industry and dams on rivers that drain into it have harmed its ecology. It is predicted that during the 21st century, the depth of the sea will decrease by 9\u201318 m (30\u201360 ft) due to global warming and the process of desertification, leading to an ecocide.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe sea's name stems from Caspi, the  ancient people who lived to the southwest of the sea in Transcaucasia. Strabo (died circa AD 24) wrote that \"to the country of the Albanians (Caucasian Albania, not to be confused with the country of Albania) belongs also the territory called Caspiane, which was named after the Caspian tribe, as was also the sea; but the tribe has now disappeared\". Moreover, the Caspian Gates, part of Iran's Tehran province, may evince such people migrated to the south. The Iranian city of Qazvin shares the root of its name with this common name for the sea. The traditional and medieval Arabic name for the sea was Ba\u1e25r ('sea') Khazar, but in recent centuries the common and standard name in Arabic language has become \u0628\u062d\u0631 \u0642\u0632\u0648\u064a\u0646 Ba\u1e25r Qazvin, the Arabized form of Caspian. In modern Russian language, it is known as Russian: \u041a\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0301\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0301\u0440\u0435, Kaspiyskoye more.\nSome Turkic ethnic groups refer to it with the Caspi(an) descriptor; in Kazakh it is called \u041a\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u0435\u04a3\u0456\u0437\u0456, Kaspiy te\u00f1izi, Kyrgyz: \u041a\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u04a3\u0438\u0437\u0438, romanized: Kaspiy de\u00f1izi, Uzbek: Kaspiy dengizi. Others refer to it as the Khazar sea: Turkmen: Hazar de\u0148zi; Azerbaijani: X\u0259z\u0259r d\u0259nizi, Turkish: Hazar Denizi. In all these the first word refers to the historical Khazar Khaganate, a large empire based to the north of the Caspian Sea between the 7th and 10th centuries.\nIn Iran, the lake is referred to as the Mazandaran Sea (Persian: \u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u0627\u0632\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0627\u0646), after the historic Mazandaran Province at its southern shores.\nOld Russian sources use the Khvalyn or Khvalis Sea (\u0425\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044b\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0435 / \u0425\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0435) after the name of Khwarezmia.\nAmong Greeks and Persians in classical antiquity it was the Hyrcanian ocean.\nRenaissance European maps labelled it as the Abbacuch Sea (Oronce Fine's 1531 world map), Mar de Bachu (Ortellius' 1570 map), or Mar de Sala (the \nThe Sea of Japan (see below for other names) is the marginal sea between the Japanese archipelago, Sakhalin, the Korean Peninsula, and the mainland of the Russian Far East. The Japanese archipelago separates the sea from the Pacific Ocean. Like the Mediterranean Sea, it has almost no tides due to its nearly complete enclosure from the Pacific Ocean. This isolation also affects faunal diversity and salinity, both of which are lower than in the open ocean. The sea has no large islands, bays or capes. Its water balance is mostly determined by the inflow and outflow through the straits connecting it to the neighboring seas and the Pacific Ocean. Few rivers discharge into the sea and their total contribution to the water exchange is within 1%.\nThe seawater has an elevated concentration of dissolved oxygen that results in high biological productivity. Therefore, fishing is the dominant economic activity in the region. The intensity of shipments across the sea has been moderate owing to political issues, but it is steadily increasing as a result of the growth of East Asian economies.\n\n\n== Names ==\nSea of Japan is the dominant term used in English for the sea, and the name in most European languages is equivalent, but it is sometimes called by different names in surrounding countries.\nThe sea is called Nihon kai (\u65e5\u672c\u6d77, literally 'Japan Sea') in Japan, R\u00ecb\u011bn h\u01cei (\u65e5\u672c\u6d77, 'Japan Sea') or originally J\u012bng h\u01cei (\u9cb8\u6d77, 'Whale Sea') in China, Yaponskoye more (\u042f\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0435, 'Japanese Sea') in Russia, Chos\u014fn Tonghae (\uc870\uc120\ub3d9\ud574, literally 'Korean East Sea') in North Korea, and Donghae (\ub3d9\ud574, literally 'East Sea') in South Korea.\n\n\n=== Naming dispute ===\n\nThe use of the term \"Sea of Japan\" as the dominant name is a point of contention. South Korea wants the name \"East Sea\" to be used, either instead of or in addition to \"Sea of Japan;\" while North Korea prefers the name \"East Sea of Korea\".\nThe primary issue in the dispute revolves around a disagreement about when the name \"Sea of Japan\" became the international standard. Japan claims the term has been the international standard since at least the early 19th century, while the Koreas claim that the term \"Sea of Japan\" arose later while Korea was under Japanese rule, and before that occupation, other names such as \"Sea of Korea\" or \"East Sea\" were used in English. In 2012, the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), the intergovernmental organization that maintains a publication listing the limits of ocean and sea areas around the world, abandoned its most recent of several attempts in the last 25 years to revise its publication of the sea's name. This was primarily because of the lack of agreement between the Koreas and Japan over the naming issue. In September 2020, the IHO announced that it would adopt a new numerical system, also known as \"S-130\". In November 2020, S-23, the previous version of the nautical chart made in 1953 will be made public as an IHO publication to demonstrate the evolutionary process from the analogue to the digital era. The IHO approved the proposal of the new official nautical chart. The new chart will be marked with a numerical identifier without a name.\n\n\n== History ==\nFor centuries, the sea had protected Japan from land invasions, particularly by the Mongols. It had long been navigated by Asian and, from the 18th century, by European ships. Russian expeditions of 1733\u20131743 mapped Sakhalin and the Japanese islands. In the 1780s, the Frenchman Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de Lap\u00e9rouse, traveled northward across the sea through the strait later named after him. In 1796, a British naval officer, William Robert Broughton, explored the Strait of Tartary, the eastern coast of the Russian Far East and the Korean Peninsula.\nIn 1803\u20131806, the Russian navigator Adam Johann von Krusenstern while sailing across the globe in the ship Nadezhda also explored, in passing, the Sea of Japan and the eastern shores of Japanese islands. In 1849, another Russian explorer Gennady Nevelskoy di\nVoyage to the Bottom of the Sea is a 1961 American science fiction disaster film, produced and directed by Irwin Allen, and starring Walter Pidgeon and Robert Sterling. The supporting cast includes Peter Lorre, Joan Fontaine, Barbara Eden, Michael Ansara, and Frankie Avalon. The film's storyline was written by Irwin Allen and Charles Bennett. The opening title credits theme song was sung by Avalon. The film was distributed by 20th Century Fox.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe state-of-the-art nuclear submarine, Seaview, is on diving trials in the Arctic Ocean. Seaview is designed by scientist Admiral Harriman Nelson (USN-Ret). Captain Lee Crane is Seaview's Commanding Officer. The mission includes being out of radio contact for 96 hours while under the Arctic ice cap. The polar ice begins to crack and melt, with boulder-size pieces sinking into the ocean around the submerged submarine. Surfacing, they discover the sky is on fire. After rescuing scientist Miguel Alvarez and his dog at Ice Floe Delta, Seaview receives a radio message from Mission Director Inspector Bergan at the Bureau of Marine Exploration. After piercing the Van Allen radiation belt, a meteor shower caught on fire, resulting in an increase in the global temperature.\nThe President summons Admiral Nelson to a United Nations Emergency Scientific meeting. Nelson and Commodore Lucius Emery have devised a plan to end the catastrophe. Seaview arrives in New York Harbor two days later. According to Nelson and Emery's calculations, if the increasing temperature is not stopped, it will become irreversible and the Earth will die in about three weeks. Nelson and Emery propose extinguishing the fire by launching a nuclear missile at the burning belt from the Mariana Islands. A nuclear explosion should extinguish the flames, \"amputating\" the belt from the Earth. Seaview can fire the missile. The chief scientist and head delegate, Vienna's Emilio Zucco, rejects Nelson's plan as too risky. He believes the composition of the belt's gasses will cause the fire to soon burn itself out. Nelson disagrees with Zucco's theory, claiming that his estimated burn-out point is incorrect. However, Nelson and Emery's plan is rejected. The two leave the proceedings intending to get authorization directly from the President himself.\nThe Seaview races to reach the optimal firing position above the Pacific Ocean's Mariana Trench in time for the needed angle of trajectory. Nelson and Crane attempt tapping the Rio-to-London telephone cable, trying to reach the President. During the cable tapping attempt, Crane and Alvarez battle a giant squid. They can only tap into the London cable, and Nelson learns there has been no contact with the U.S. for 35 hours.\nAn unsuccessful attempt on the Admiral's life indicates a saboteur is aboard. Alvarez, a religious zealot regarding the catastrophe, is the suspected saboteur. Dr. Susan Hiller, who privately supports Dr. Zucco's plan, is another suspect.\nThe Seaview's main generator is then sabotaged by a crew member who lost his mind, forcing Nelson to order Crane to proceed while repairs are made despite the risk of traveling without power for the sonar and radar. As a result, the submarine narrowly escapes a minefield left over from World War II. The crew are near-mutiny, to the point that when the Seaview encounters a motor ship whose crew is dead, Captain Crane and the Admiral allow any men who wish to leave rather than continue the mission to sail the derelict home.\nCrane begins doubting the Admiral's tactics and reasoning. A hostile submarine pursues them, diving into the Mariana Trench, exceeding its crush depth; it implodes before it can destroy Seaview.\nThe saboteur has shut down the sub's power. Crane encounters Dr. Hiller, the saboteur, atop the shark tank, as she exits the restricted nuclear reactor core. Her radiation detector badge has turned red, showing she has been exposed to a fatal dose. When asked why, she says to prevent the sub from reaching its target. A\nThe Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, sometimes referred to as the Third and Fourth Battles of Savo Island, the Battle of the Solomons, The Battle of Friday the 13th, The Night of the Big Guns, or, in Japanese sources, the Third Battle of the Solomon Sea (\u7b2c\u4e09\u6b21\u30bd\u30ed\u30e2\u30f3\u6d77\u6226, Dai-san-ji Soromon Kaisen), took place from 12 to 15 November 1942 and was the decisive engagement in a series of naval battles between Allied (primarily American) and Imperial Japanese forces during the months-long Guadalcanal campaign in the Solomon Islands during World War II. The action consisted of combined air and sea engagements over four days, most near Guadalcanal and all related to a Japanese effort to reinforce land forces on the island. The only two U.S. Navy admirals to be killed in a surface engagement in the war were lost in this battle.\nAllied forces landed on Guadalcanal on 7 August 1942 and seized an airfield, later called Henderson Field, that was under construction by the Japanese military. There were several subsequent attempts to recapture the airfield by the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy using reinforcements delivered to Guadalcanal by ship, efforts  which ultimately failed. In early November 1942, the Japanese organized a transport convoy to take 7,000 infantry troops and their equipment to Guadalcanal to attempt once again to retake the airfield. Several Japanese warship forces were assigned to bombard Henderson Field with the goal of destroying Allied aircraft that posed a threat to the convoy. Learning of the Japanese reinforcement effort, U.S. forces launched aircraft and warship attacks to defend Henderson Field and prevent the Japanese ground troops from reaching Guadalcanal.\nIn the resulting battle, both sides lost numerous warships in two extremely destructive surface engagements at night. Nevertheless, the U.S. succeeded in turning back attempts by the Japanese to bombard Henderson Field with battleships. Allied aircraft also sank most of the Japanese troop transports and prevented the majority of the Japanese troops and equipment from reaching Guadalcanal. Thus, the battle turned back Japan's last major attempt to dislodge Allied forces from Guadalcanal and nearby Tulagi, resulting in a strategic victory for the U.S. and its allies and deciding the ultimate outcome of the Guadalcanal campaign in their favor. The Japanese decided on the evacuation of Guadalcanal the following month, which they completed by early February 1943.\nGuadalcanal was the last major naval battle in the Pacific War for the next one-and-a-half years, until the Battle of the Philippine Sea. It was one of the costliest naval battles of the Second World War in terms of lives lost.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe six-month Guadalcanal campaign began on 7 August 1942, when Allied (primarily U.S.) forces landed on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and the Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands, a pre-war colonial possession of Great Britain. The landings were meant to prevent the Japanese using the islands as bases from which to threaten the supply routes between the U.S. and Australia, to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign to neutralize the major Imperial Japanese military base at Rabaul, and to support the Allied New Guinea campaign. The Japanese had occupied Tulagi in May 1942 and began constructing an airfield on Guadalcanal in June 1942.\nBy nightfall on 8 August, the 11,000 Allied troops secured Tulagi, the nearby small islands, and a Japanese airfield under construction at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal (later renamed Henderson Field). Allied aircraft operating out of Henderson were called the \"Cactus Air Force\" (CAF) after the Allied code name for Guadalcanal. To protect the airfield, the U.S. Marines established a perimeter defense around Lunga Point. Additional reinforcements over the next two months increased the number of U.S. troops at Lunga Point to more than 20,000 men.\nIn response, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters assigned the Imperial Japanese Army's \nThe Black Sea is a marginal mediterranean sea lying between Europe and Asia, east of the Balkans, south of the East European Plain, west of the Caucasus, and north of Anatolia. It is bounded by Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. The Black Sea is supplied by major rivers, principally the Danube, Dnieper and Dniester. Consequently, while six countries have a coastline on the sea, its drainage basin includes parts of 24 countries in Europe.\nThe Black Sea, not including the Sea of Azov, covers 436,400 km2 (168,500 sq mi), has a maximum depth of 2,212 m (7,257 ft), and a volume of 547,000 km3 (131,000 cu mi). \nMost of its coasts ascend rapidly.\nThese rises are the Pontic Mountains to the south, bar the southwest-facing peninsulas, the Caucasus Mountains to the east, and the Crimean Mountains to the mid-north.\nIn the west, the coast is generally small floodplains below foothills such as the Strandzha; Cape Emine, a dwindling of the east end of the Balkan Mountains; and the Dobruja Plateau considerably farther north.\nThe longest east\u2013west extent is about 1,175 km (730 mi).\nImportant cities along the coast include (clockwise from the Bosporus) Burgas, Varna, Constan\u021ba, Odesa, Sevastopol, Novorossiysk, Sochi,  Poti, Batumi, Trabzon and Samsun.\nThe Black Sea has a positive water balance, with an annual net outflow of 300 km3 (72 cu mi) per year through the Bosporus and the Dardanelles into the Aegean Sea. While the net flow of water through the Bosporus and Dardanelles (known collectively as the Turkish Straits) is out of the Black Sea, water generally flows in both directions simultaneously: Denser, more saline water from the Aegean flows into the Black Sea underneath the less dense, fresher water that flows out of the Black Sea. This creates a significant and permanent layer of deep water that does not drain or mix and is therefore anoxic. This anoxic layer is responsible for the preservation of ancient shipwrecks which have been found in the Black Sea, which ultimately drains into the Mediterranean Sea, via the Turkish Straits and the Aegean Sea. The Bosporus strait connects it to the small Sea of Marmara which in turn is connected to the Aegean Sea via the strait of the Dardanelles. To the north, the Black Sea is connected to the Sea of Azov by the Kerch Strait.\nThe water level has varied significantly over geological time. Due to these variations in the water level in the basin, the surrounding shelf and associated aprons have sometimes been dry land. At certain critical water levels, connections with surrounding water bodies can become established. It is through the most active of these connective routes, the Turkish Straits, that the Black Sea joins the World Ocean. During geological periods when this hydrological link was not present, the Black Sea was an endorheic basin, operating independently of the global ocean system (similar to the Caspian Sea today). Currently, the Black Sea water level is relatively high; thus, water is being exchanged with the Mediterranean. The Black Sea undersea river is a current of particularly saline water flowing through the Bosporus Strait and along the seabed of the Black Sea, the first of its kind discovered.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\n\n=== Modern names ===\nCurrent names of the sea are usually equivalents of the English name \"Black Sea\", including these given in the countries bordering the sea:\n\nAbkhaz: \u0410\u043c\u0448\u044b\u043d \u0415\u0438\u049b\u04d9\u0430, romanized: Am\u015d\u0259n Ejk\u02b7a, IPA: [\u0251m\u0282\u0268n \u025bjk\u02b7\u02b0\u0251]\nAdyghe: \u0425\u044b \u0428\u04cf\u0443\u0446\u04cf\u044d, romanized: X\u0259 \u0160\u02b7\u02bcuc\u02bc\u025b, IPA: [x\u0258 \u0283\u02b7\u02bcts\u02bc\u025c]\nArmenian: \u054d\u0565\u0582 \u056e\u0578\u057e, romanized: Sev cov, IPA: [s\u025bv t\u0361s\u0254v]\nAzerbaijani: Qara d\u0259niz, IPA: [ka\u02c8\u027ea deniz]\nBulgarian: \u0427e\u0440\u043d\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0440e, romanized: \u010c\u00e9rno mor\u00e9, IPA: [\u02c8t\u0361\u0283\u025brno mo\u02c8r\u025b]\nCrimean Tatar: Qara de\u00f1iz, \u041a\u044a\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044a\u0438\u0437, IPA: [q\u0251r\u0251 de\u014biz]\nGeorgian: \u10e8\u10d0\u10d5\u10d8 \u10d6\u10e6\u10d5\u10d0, romanized: shavi zghva, IPA: [\u0283avi z\u0281\u02b7a]\nLaz and Mingrelian: \u10e3\u10e9\u10d0 \u10d6\u10e3\u10e6\u10d0, romanized: Ucha Zugha, IPA: [\u02c8ut\u0283\u00e4 \u02c8zu\u0263\u00e4], or simply \u10d6\u10e3\u10e6\u10d0, IPA: [\u02c8zu\u0263\u00e4], \"Sea\"\nRomanian: Marea Neagr\u0103, pronounced [\u02c8mare\u032fa \u02c8ne\u032fa\u0261r\u0259] \nRussian: \u0427\u0451\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0301\u0440\u0435, \nThe Coral Sea (French: Mer de Corail) is a marginal sea of the South Pacific off the northeast coast of Australia, and classified as an interim Australian bioregion. The Coral Sea extends 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) down the Australian northeast coast. Most of it is protected by the French Natural Park of the Coral Sea (French: Parc Naturel de la Mer de Corail) and the Australian Coral Sea Marine Park. The sea was the location for the Battle of the Coral Sea, a major confrontation during World War II between the navies of the Empire of Japan, and the United States and Australia.\nThe sea contains numerous islands and reefs, as well as the world's largest reef system, the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), which was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1981. All previous oil exploration projects were terminated at the GBR in 1975, and fishing is restricted in many areas. The reefs and islands of the Coral Sea are particularly rich in birds and aquatic life and are a popular tourist destination, both domestically and internationally.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nIt is bounded in the west by the east coast of Queensland, thereby including the Great Barrier Reef, in the east by Vanuatu (formerly the New Hebrides) and by New Caledonia, and in the northeast approximately by the southern extremity of the Solomon Islands. In the northwest, it reaches to the south coast of eastern New Guinea, thereby including the Gulf of Papua. It merges with the Tasman Sea in the south, with the Solomon Sea in the north and with the Pacific Ocean in the east. On the west, it is bounded by the mainland coast of Queensland, and in the northwest, it connects with the Arafura Sea through the Torres Strait.\nThe sea is characterised by its warm climate, with frequent rains and tropical cyclones.\n\n\n== Extent ==\n\nWhile the Great Barrier Reef with its islands and cays belong to Queensland, most reefs and islets east of it are part of the Coral Sea Islands Territory. In addition, some islands west of and belonging to New Caledonia are also part of the Coral Sea Islands in a geographical sense, such as the Chesterfield Islands and Bellona Reefs.\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Coral Sea as follows:\n\nOn the North.

There are particular seas and the sea. The sea commonly refers to the Ocean, the interconnected body of seawaters that spans most of Earth.\nParticular seas are either marginal seas, second-order sections of the oceanic sea (e.g. the Mediterranean Sea), or certain large, nearly landlocked bodies of water.\nThe salinity of water bodies varies widely, being lower near the surface and the mouths of large rivers and higher in the depths of the ocean; however, the relative proportions of dissolved salts vary little across the oceans. The most abundant solid dissolved in seawater is sodium chloride. The water also contains salts of magnesium, calcium, potassium, and mercury, amongst many other elements, some in minute concentrations. A wide variety of organisms, including bacteria, protists, algae, plants, fungi, and animals live in the seas, which offers a wide range of marine habitats and ecosystems, ranging vertically from the sunlit surface and shoreline to the great depths and pressures of the cold, dark abyssal zone, and in latitude from the cold waters under polar ice caps to the warm waters of coral reefs in tropical regions. Many of the major groups of organisms evolved in the sea and life may have started there.\nThe ocean moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water, carbon, and nitrogen cycles. The surface of water interacts with the atmosphere, exchanging properties such as particles and temperature, as well as currents. Surface currents are the water currents that are produced by the atmosphere's currents and its winds blowing over the surface of the water, producing wind waves, setting up through drag slow but stable circulations of water, as in the case of the ocean sustaining deep-sea ocean currents. Deep-sea currents, known together as the global conveyor belt, carry cold water from near the poles to every ocean and significantly influence Earth's climate. Tides, the generally twice-daily rise and fall of sea levels, are caused by Earth's rotation and the gravitational effects of the Moon and, to a lesser extent, of the Sun. Tides may have a very high range in bays or estuaries. Submarine earthquakes arising from tectonic plate movements under the oceans can lead to destructive tsunamis, as can volcanoes, huge landslides, or the impact of large meteorites.\nThe seas have been an integral element for humans throughout history and culture. Humans harnessing and studying the seas have been recorded since ancient times and evidenced well into prehistory, while its modern scientific study is called oceanography and maritime space is governed by the law of the sea, with admiralty law regulating human interactions at sea. The seas provide substantial supplies of food for humans, mainly fish, but also shellfish, mammals and seaweed, whether caught by fishermen or farmed underwater. Other human uses of the seas include trade, travel, mineral extraction, power generation, warfare, and leisure activities such as swimming, sailing, and scuba diving. Many of these activities create marine pollution.\n\n\n== Definition ==\n\nThe sea is the interconnected system of all the Earth's oceanic waters, including the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Southern and Arctic Oceans. However, the word \"sea\" can also be used for many specific, much smaller bodies of seawater, such as the North Sea or the Red Sea. There is no sharp distinction between seas and oceans, though generally seas are smaller, and are often partly (as marginal seas or particularly as a mediterranean sea) or wholly (as inland seas) enclosed by land. However, an exception to this is the Sargasso Sea which has no coastline and lies within a circular current, the North Atlantic Gyre.:\u200a90\u200a Seas are generally larger than lakes and contain salt water, but the Sea of Galilee is a freshwater lake. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea states that all of the ocean is \"sea\".\n\n\n=== Legal definition ===\nThe law of the sea has at \nThe Salton Sea is a shallow, landlocked, highly saline endorheic lake in Riverside and Imperial counties at the southern end of the U.S. state of California. It lies on the San Andreas Fault within the Salton Trough, which stretches to the Gulf of California in Mexico. The lake is about 15 by 35 miles (24 by 56 km) at its widest and longest. A 2023 report puts the surface area at 318 square miles (823.6 km2). The Salton Sea became a resort destination in the 20th Century, but saw die-offs of fish and birds in the 1980s due to contamination from farm runoff, and clouds of toxic dust in the current century as evaporation exposed parts of the lake bed.\nOver millions of years, the Colorado River had flowed into the Imperial Valley and deposited alluvium (soil), creating fertile farmland, building up the terrain, and constantly moving its main course and river delta. For thousands of years, the river alternately flowed into the valley or diverted around it, creating either a salt lake called Lake Cahuilla or a dry desert basin, respectively. When the river diverted around the valley, the lake dried completely, as it did around 1580. Hundreds of archaeological sites have been found in this region, indicating possibly long-term Native American villages and temporary camps.\nThe modern lake was formed from an inflow of water from the Colorado River in 1905. Beginning in 1900, an irrigation canal was dug from the Colorado River to provide water to the Imperial Valley for farming. Water from spring floods broke through a canal head-gate, diverting a portion of the river flow into the Salton Basin for two years before repairs were completed. The water in the formerly dry lake bed created the modern lake.\nDuring the early 20th century, the lake would have dried up, except that farmers used generous amounts of Colorado River water for irrigation and let the excess flow into the lake. In the 1950s and into the 1960s, the area became a resort destination, and communities grew with hotels and vacation homes. Birdwatching was also popular as the wetlands were a major resting stop on the Pacific Flyway. In the 1970s, scientists issued warnings that the lake would continue to shrink and become more inhospitable to wildlife. In the 1980s, contamination from farm runoff promoted the outbreak and spread of wildlife diseases. Massive die-offs of the avian populations have occurred, especially after the loss of several species of fish on which they depend. Salinity rose so high that large fish kills occurred, often blighting the beaches of the sea with their carcasses. Tourism was drastically reduced.\nAfter 1999, the lake began to shrink as local agriculture used the water more efficiently, so less runoff flowed into the lake. As the lake bed became exposed, the winds sent clouds of toxic dust into nearby communities. The state is mainly responsible for fixing the problems. California lawmakers pledged to fund air-quality management projects in conjunction with the signing of the 2003 agreement to send more water to coastal cities. Local, state and federal bodies all had found minimal success dealing with the dust, dying wildlife, and other problems for which warnings had been issued decades before. In 2017, the Salton Sea Management Program was developed by the state. The Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians partnered with the state to restore shallow wetlands along the northern edge of the sea in 2018. Construction began in 2021 on a 4,110-acre (1,660 ha) habitat restoration and dust suppression project.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Before the modern era ===\nThe Gulf of California would extend as far north as the city of Indio, some 150 miles (240 km) northwest of its current limits, were it not for the delta created by the Colorado River. Over three million years, through all of the Pleistocene, the river's delta expanded until it cut off the northern part of the gulf. Since then, the Colorado River has alternated between emptying into the basin, creat\nThe Banda Sea (Indonesian: Laut Banda, Portuguese: Mar de Banda, Tetum: Tasi Banda) is one of four seas that surround the Maluku Islands of Indonesia, connected to the Pacific Ocean, but surrounded by hundreds of islands, including Timor, as well as the Halmahera and Ceram Seas. It is about 1000 km (600 mi) east to west, and about 500 km (300 mi) north to south.\n\n\n== Extent ==\nThe International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) defines the Banda Sea as being one of the waters of the East Indian Archipelago. The IHO defines its limits as follows:\n\nOn the North The Southern limits of the Molukka Sea  [sic] and the Western and Southern limits of the Ceram Sea.\n\nOn the East. From Tg Borang, the Northern point of Noehoe Tjoet [Kai Besar], through this island to its Southern point, thence a line to the Northeast point of Fordata, through this island and across to the Northeast point of Larat, Tanimbar Islands (7\u00b006\u2032S 131\u00b055\u2032E), down the East coast of Jamdena [Yamdena] Island to its Southern point, thence through Anggarmasa to the North point of Selaroe and through this island to Tg Aro Oesoe its Southern point (8\u00b021\u2032S 130\u00b045\u2032E).\nOn the South.

Although the borders of the sea are hazardous to navigation, with many small rocky islands, the middle of the sea is relatively open. Island groups within the sea include the Banda Islands. Some islands in the Banda Sea are active volcanoes including Gunung Api and Manuk in the Banda Islands.\n\n\n== Geology ==\n\n\n=== Plate tectonic activities in Banda Sea ===\n\nThe Banda arc is famous for its 180\u00b0 curvature and is, in Timor, generally agreed to be the product of a collision between a volcanic arc and the Australian continental margin. The Banda Sea occupies the main portion of the Banda Sea plate. The southern margin of the sea consists of island arcs above subduction zones. To the east of the Sunda Trench is the Timor Trough which lies south of Timor, the Tanimbar Trough south of the Tanimbar Islands and the Aru Trough east of the Aru Islands. These trenches are the subduction zone of the Indo-Australian plate beneath the Banda Sea plate, where the Indo-Australian plate moves northwards. Fore-arc sediments progressively carried northwards by the Indo-Australian plate have been folded and faulted forming Timor island. To the northeast lies Seram Island which overlies the subduction of the Bird's Head plate of West Papua. The deepest point of the sea, Weber Deep, is an exposed oceanic fault and the world's deepest forearc basin, with depth more than 7.2 kilometres (4.5 miles).\n\n\n=== Earthquakes ===\n\nEarthquakes are very frequent in the area, due to the confluence of three tectonic plates \u2013 Eurasian, Pacific and Indo-Australian plates.\n\n1852 Banda\nBetween 1901 and 2018, the average sea level rose by 15\u201325 cm (6\u201310 in), with an increase of 2.3 mm (0.091 in) per year since the 1970s.:\u200a1216\u200a This was faster than the sea level had ever risen over at least the past 3,000 years.:\u200a1216\u200a The rate accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for the decade 2013\u20132022. Climate change due to human activities is the main cause.:\u200a5,\u200a8\u200a Between 1993 and 2018, melting ice sheets and glaciers accounted for 44% of sea level rise, with another 42% resulting from thermal expansion of water.:\u200a1576\u200a\nSea level rise lags behind changes in the Earth's temperature by many decades, and sea level rise will therefore continue to accelerate between now and 2050 in response to warming that has already happened. What happens after that depends on human greenhouse gas emissions. If there are very deep cuts in emissions, sea level rise would slow between 2050 and 2100. It could then reach by 2100 slightly over 30 cm (1 ft) from now and approximately 60 cm (2 ft) from the 19th century. With high emissions it would instead accelerate further, and could rise by 1.0 m (3+1\u20443 ft) or even 1.6 m (5+1\u20443 ft) by 2100.:\u200a1302\u200a In the long run, sea level rise would amount to 2\u20133 m (7\u201310 ft) over the next 2000 years if warming stays to its current 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) over the pre-industrial past. It would be 19\u201322 metres (62\u201372 ft) if warming peaks at 5 \u00b0C (9.0 \u00b0F).:\u200a21\u200a\nRising seas affect every coastal and island population on Earth. This can be through flooding, higher storm surges, king tides, and tsunamis. There are many knock-on effects. They lead to loss of coastal ecosystems like mangroves. Crop yields may reduce because of increasing salt levels in irrigation water. Damage to ports disrupts sea trade. The sea level rise projected by 2050 will expose places currently inhabited by tens of millions of people to annual flooding. Without a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, this may increase to hundreds of millions in the latter decades of the century. \nLocal factors like tidal range or land subsidence will greatly affect the severity of impacts. For instance, sea level rise in the United States is likely to be two to three times greater than the global average by the end of the century. Yet, of the 20 countries with the greatest exposure to sea level rise, twelve are in Asia, including Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines. The resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems and countries also varies, which will result in more or less pronounced impacts. The greatest impact on human populations in the near term will occur in the low-lying Caribbean and Pacific islands. Sea level rise will make many of them uninhabitable later this century. \nSocieties can adapt to sea level rise in multiple ways. Managed retreat, accommodating coastal change, or protecting against sea level rise through hard-construction practices like seawalls are hard approaches. There are also soft approaches such as dune rehabilitation and beach nourishment. Sometimes these adaptation strategies go hand in hand. At other times choices must be made among different strategies. Poorer nations may also struggle to implement the same approaches to adapt to sea level rise as richer states.  \n\n\n== Observations ==\nBetween 1901 and 2018, the global mean sea level rose by about 20 cm (7.9 in). More precise data gathered from satellite radar measurements found an increase of 7.5 cm (3.0 in) from 1993 to 2017 (average of 2.9 mm (0.11 in)/yr). This accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for 2013\u20132022. Paleoclimate data shows that this rate of sea level rise is the fastest it had been over at least the past 3,000 years.:\u200a1216\u200a\nSea level rise is not uniform around the globe. Some land masses are moving up or down as a consequence of subsidence (land sinking or settling) or post-glacial rebound (land rising as melting ice reduces weight). Therefore, local relative sea level rise may be higher or lower than the global average. Changing ice masses also affect th\nThe Timor Sea (Indonesian: Laut Timor, Portuguese: Mar de Timor, Tetum: Tasi Mane or Tasi Tim\u00f3r) is a relatively shallow sea in the Indian Ocean bounded to the north by the island of Timor with Timor-Leste to the north, Indonesia to the northwest, Arafura Sea to the east, and to the south by Australia. The Sunda Trench marks the deepest point of the Timor Sea with a depth of more than 3300 metres, separating the continents of Oceania in the southeast and Asia to the northwest and north. The Timor sea is prone to earthquakes and tsunamis north of the Sunda Trench, due to its location on the Ring of Fire as well as volcanic activity and can experience major cyclones, due to the proximity from the Equator.\nThe sea contains a number of reefs, uninhabited islands and significant hydrocarbon reserves. International disputes emerged after the reserves were discovered resulting in the signing of the Timor Sea Treaty.\nThe Timor Sea was hit by the worst oil spill for 25 years in 2009.\nIt is possible that Australia's first inhabitants crossed the Timor Sea from the Malay Archipelago at a time when sea levels were lower.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Timor Sea is named after Timor, the island on the other side of the sea's northern coastline. The island's name is a variant of timur, Malay for \"east\".\nIn Tetum, the sea is often referred to by the expression tasi mane (lit. transl.\u2009'male sea'). The counterpart of that body of water, the 'Ombai-Wetar Strait', which has smaller waves, is less turbid, and washes most of Timor island's northern shores, is commonly referred to in Tetum as tasi feto (lit. transl.\u2009'female sea').\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe waters to the east are known as the Arafura Sea. The Timor Sea is adjacent to three substantial inlets on the north Australian coast, the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf, Beagle Gulf and the Van Diemen Gulf. The Australian city of Darwin which is located in part on the shore of the Beagle Gulf, is the nearest large city to the sea. The small town of Wyndham is located on the west arm of Cambridge Gulf, an inlet of Joseph Bonaparte Gulf.\nRivers that enter the Timor Sea from the Northern Territory include Fish River, King River, Dry River, Victoria River and the Alligator Rivers. Rivers in the Kimberley region that flow into the Timor Sea include the Ord River, Forrest River, Pentecost River and Durack River.\nThe sea is about 480 km (300 mi) wide, covering an area of about 610 thousand km2 (240,000 sq mi). Its deepest point is the Timor Trough (which some geologists consider is the south-eastern extension of the Java Trench, but others view as a foreland trough to the Timor Island \"mountain range\"), located in the northern part of the sea, which reaches a depth of 3,300 m (10,800 ft). The remainder of the sea is much shallower, much of it averaging less than 200 m (660 ft) deep, as it overlies the Sahul Shelf, part of the Australian continental shelf.\nThe Big Bank Shoals is an area on the sloping seabed between the continental shelf and the Timor Trough where a number of submerged banks are located. The ecosystem of the shoals differs significantly from the deeper waters surrounding them. In May 2010, it was announced that a crater about 50 km (31 mi) wide has been discovered on the seabed of the Timor Sea.\n\n\n=== Extent ===\n\nThe International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) defines the Timor Sea as being one of the waters of the East Indian Archipelago. The IHO defines its limits as follows:\n\nOn the North The Southeastern limit of the Savu Sea [By a line from the Southwest point of Timor to the Northeast point of Roti, through this island to its Southwest point] the Southeastern coast of Timor and the Southern limit of the Banda Sea [A line from Tanjong Aro Oesoe, through Sermata to Tanjong Njadora the Southeast point of Lakov (8\u00b016\u2032S 128\u00b014\u2032E) along the South coasts of Lakov, Moa and Leti Islands to Tanjong Toet Pateh, the West point of Leti, thence a line to Tanjong Sewirawa the Eastern extremity of Timor].\nOn the Eas", "metadata": {"title": "Solomon Sea", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Sea#Deepest_point"}}
