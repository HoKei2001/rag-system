The focus is on a 20-something couple with unspecified learning difficulties, Olinka (Kateřina Holánová) and Standa (Jan Budař), who are preparing to have sex for the first time. Standa has been receiving advice from his brother Jarda (Martin Pechlát), while Olinka has been given tips and guidance by her friends, the women who live in her apartment block. Standa and Jarda travel to Brno from Brundal for the occasion.\nMeanwhile, in a nearby pub, depressed actor Mirek (Miroslav Donutil) is with psychologist Vlasta (Pavla Tomicová), complaining about his life, and the two presently return to Vlasta's flat together where they have sex, and Vlasta counsels Mirek about the state of his marriage. In the same pub are Jaroslava (Ivana Uhlířová), a young woman who habitually attracts unpleasant men, and her current partner Richard (Marek Daniel), a pretentious and self-absorbed man who is tempted by sexual experimentation and submission. This couple return to Richard's flat in the same apartment block where Richard persuades an unwilling Jaroslava to spank him, alongside other requests. Also in the pub are life-long friends Honza (Pavel Liška) and Pavel (Filip Rajmont). While Honza rambles drunkenly about his desire for various women, Pavel has an undeclared love for Honza.\nAt the house, Olinka is horrified to see her controlling mother return unexpectedly to the flat. Panicking, she administers rohypnol into her mother's coffee, and locks her unconscious in a storage cupboard. Standa arrives and they visit Olinka's friends so Standa can be vetted for their approval. Back down in Olinka's flat, Standa and Olinka share an awkward meal, and then proceed to the bedroom and are extremely nervous, but eventually Olinka manages to initiate sex. Despite Jarda's training, Standa is unable to put on the condom, so they do not use one. Meanwhile Jarda arrives at Olinka's friends' party upstairs to drink with them.\nMeanwhile, Mirek leaves Vlasta's house to go home, but on the way has a drunken argument with his wife on the phone, and ends up walking home to Líšeň in a drunken depression. Honza and Pavel also head home to Pavel's house, and Pavel is perturbed when Honza kisses his cheek while he sleeps. After having sex, Olinka excitedly tells her friends what happened, but at the same time her mother wakes up and sees Standa dancing in his underwear through the keyhole. When Olinka returns to the flat, the two women argue, and Standa flees the flat in panic.\nPavel and Honza leave Pavel's place very early to deliver rohlík to Líšeň, but on the way Pavel takes his eyes off the road and hits Mirek, killing him. Comforting Pavel, Honza confides that his love is returned. Meanwhile, Olinka releases her mother from the pantry, but then locks her in again when Standa returns to her. A voice over confirms that Olinka is pregnant.\n\n\n== External links ==\nNuda v Brně at IMDb\nJan Budař (born 31 July 1977) is a Czech actor, director, singer, composer and script writer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBudař was born in Frýdlant near Liberec.

Based on the folktale Otesánek by Karel Jaromír Erben, the film is a comedic live action, stop motion-animated feature film set mainly in an apartment building in the Czech Republic.\nThe film uses the Overture to Der Freischütz (1821) by Carl Maria von Weber as the score.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nKarel Horák (Jan Hartl) and Božena Horáková (Veronika Žilková) are a childless couple and for medical reasons are doomed to remain so. While on vacation with their neighbors, the Stadlers at a house in the country, Karel decides to buy the house at the suggestion of Mr. Stadler. When he is fixing up the house, he digs up a tree stump that looks vaguely like a baby. He spends the rest of the evening cleaning it up and then presents it to his wife. She names the stump Otík and starts to treat it like a real baby. She then works out a plan to fake her pregnancy and becoming more and more impatient she speeds up the process and 'gives birth' one month early.\nOtík comes alive and has an insatiable appetite. Alžbětka (Kristina Adamcová), the Stadlers’ daughter, has been suspicious all along, and when she reads the fairy tale about Otesánek, the truth becomes clear to her. Meanwhile, little Otík has been just eating and growing. At one point he eats some of Božena's hair, and another day she returns home to find that Otík has eaten their cat. Karel and his wife are at odds with Karel pushing for killing the creature and Božena defending it as their child. The baby later consumes a postal worker (Gustav Vondráček) and then a social worker (Jitka Smutná).\nThe resulting deaths lead Karel to tie up and lock Otík away in the basement of their apartment building, leaving Otík to starve. Alžbětka secretly takes over as prime caretaker. She tries to keep Otík fed with normal human food, but, when her mother stops her, she is forced to drawing straws (matches in this case) to choose a person to feed to Otík. The chosen victim is an old man and pedophile, Mr. Žlábek (Zdeněk Kozák) who has been stalking her recently. Deciding she cannot take the stalking anymore, Alžbětka lures Mr. Žlábek to the basement where he gets entangled by Otik's vines and devoured. Karel himself later becomes a victim when he comes into the basement with a chainsaw but on seeing Otík he hesitates and calls him \"son\" before dropping the chainsaw. Afterwards, Božena goes into the basement and is heard screaming; having become a victim herself. In the end, Otík disobeys Alžbětka despite repeated warnings and eats all of Mrs. Správcová's (Dagmar Stříbrná) cabbage patch, prompting the old woman to take charge.\n\n\n=== Ending ===\nIn the fairy tale upon which the movie is based, the old woman kills Otesánek by splitting his stomach open with a hoe; however, the film ends with her descending the stairs, Alžbětka reciting the end of the fairy tale tearfully; the audience is not allowed to witness the deed.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nVeronika Žilková as Božena Horáková\nJan Hartl as Karel Horák\nKristina Adamcová as Alžbětka\nJaroslava Kretschmerová as Alžbětka's Mother\nPavel Nový as Alžbětka's Father\nDagmar Stríbrná as Pani spravcova (the caretaker)\nZdenek Kozák as Mr. Žlábek\nGustav Vondracek as Mládek, the Postman\nJitka Smutná as Bulanková, the Social worker\n\n\n== Reception ==\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 84% based on 44 reviews, with a weighted average rating of 7/10.

A friend offers him a chance to earn a great deal of money through a sham marriage to a Russian woman to enable her to stay in Czechoslovakia. The woman then uses her new citizenship to emigrate to West Germany, where her boyfriend lives.\nDue to a concurrence of circumstances, she has to leave behind her 5-year-old son, Kolya, for the disgruntled Czech musician to look after. At first Louka and Kolya have communication difficulties, as they don't speak each other's languages and the many false friend words that exist in Czech and Russian add to the confusion. Gradually, though, a bond forms between Louka and Kolya. The child suffers from suspected meningitis and has to be placed on a course of carefully monitored antibiotics. Louka is threatened with imprisonment for his suspect marriage and the child may be placed in a Soviet children's home. The Velvet Revolution intervenes though, and Kolya is reunited with his mother.

The stage drama is transferred to the real world when a tragedy occurs during rehearsal involving one of the spectators. \n\n\n== Cast ==\nMichaela Badinková as Katya\nIgor Chmela as Ivan Karamazov\nRadek Holub as Smerdyakov\nLenka Krobotová as Grushenka\nDavid Novotný as Dmitriy Karamazov\nIvan Trojan as Stary Karamazov\nMartin Myšička as Alyosha Karamazov\nJerzy Michal Bozyk as Pianist\nMalgorzata Galkowska\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nKaramazovi won the International Federation of Film Critics (FIPRESCI) award in Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in 2008 and was submitted by The Czech Republic for the 2009 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBratya Karamazovy, a 1969 Soviet adaptation of the same novel\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nKaramazovi at IMDb\nPavla Tomicová (born 25 June 1962) is a Czech actress.

He occupies his time by rebuilding a deserted house, and begins to recall his past, saying his main wish in life was to become a millionaire. Jan begins his career as a frankfurter vendor at a railroad station, and quickly learns the power of money and the influence it exerts on people.\nAt one point during his reminiscences, a young woman, Marcela, and her older traveling companion, a professor, settle in the area. Jan and Marcela develop a mutual attraction, though it remains unconsummated. The film continues to alternate between past and present, as the relationship between the older Jan and the new neighbors develops.\nIn the restaurant, the younger Jan has a number of affairs with various women, including an actress and a prostitute at a brothel. He also gets increasingly prestigious jobs, including a stint at a spa, the Hotel Tichota, where he has an affair with a maid. Eventually Jan finds employment in Prague at the Hotel Paříž, where he falls under the tutelage of the Maître d', Skřivánek, who claims that he once served the King of England [sic]. Eventually, Jan serves the Emperor of Ethiopia on one occasion. The Emperor tries to award Skřivánek a medal, but is too short to place the award around Skřivánek's neck. Jan is short enough for the Emperor to reach, and maneuvers to receive the medal in Skřivánek's place.\nWith the Third Reich's annexation of Czechoslovakia, Jan falls in love with Liza, a young Sudeten German woman who worships Adolf Hitler. She agrees to marry him only after he proves that he is of pure Aryan descent through medical examination. During the occupation, the other waiters and the hotel manager, Brandejs, express their contempt for the German occupiers by being as unhelpful as possible in their service to them. Jan is the only member of the waitstaff not to express such symbolic resistance. For this reason, Brandejs dismisses Jan, and says Jan will be blacklisted from employment in any Prague establishment. When Jan and Liza later appear as patrons, and Jan tells Skřivánek that serving the King of England has done him no good, Skřivánek pours food over Jan in protest. Soon, the occupying authorities take Skřivánek away and he is never seen again.\nDuring World War II, Jan works in an institute, formerly the Hotel Tichota, where German women reside to breed a new \"master race\" with selected soldiers. Because the owner, Mr Tichota, uses a wheelchair, he has been displaced as its owner and is never seen again. In the meantime, Liza serves as a nurse on the Russian front. She returns with valuable stamps taken from the homes of Polish-Jewish families. As the war progresses and the tide turns against Germany, the women are displaced from the facility, and wounded and amputee soldiers replace them. Near the war's end, the facility is attacked, and the soldiers and staff evacuated. Liza tries to retrieve the stamps from the burning building, but dies when its roof collapses on her. Jan finds her body holding the box of stamps and pries it from her hands. After the war, the stamps' value allows Jan to become a wealthy hotelier on the same premises.\nAfter the Communists take power in Czechoslovakia in 1948, Jan loses his property and wealth when he tells the Communist resistance that he himself is a millionaire. He is sentenced to prison for 15 years: one year for each of his millions. In prison, he sees that Brandejs and other formerly wealthy customers are prisoners.

It is a story of Hana and Emil Vrbata, a couple living in German-occupied Czechoslovakia, in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, during World War II.\nThe general reception by the Czech press and the audience was extremely positive. It was selected as the Czech Republic's submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the 82nd Academy Awards.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIt is 1938 and the Nazis are just one step away from invading and occupying Czechoslovakia. Hana is a young Czech film actress who also happens to be Jewish. She has just appeared in her first feature with her leading man, an older Jewish actor, who warns her that her career is over. He furthermore tells her that their picture will \"never see the light of day\" due to the fact that the Nazis will never allow its release. He hands her a forged passport and papers to get out of the country but she throws them in the trash, not believing what he says about the imminent German invasion.\nAs the filming of the 'film within a film' is on the verge of completion, we see the two actors riding stationery bicycles with a moving image in the background. As was the usual practice in creating films in earlier days, the illusion of motion is created when the moving image flickers in the background but the object in the foreground is static. This cyclist becomes a symbol for the man who pedals furiously but is actually going nowhere. That man is the Czech \"every-man\" of 1938 who desperately wishes to escape his tragic circumstances but in reality remains motionless, trapped by the forces of tyranny. Throughout the film, we catch glimpses of the film's protagonist, Emil, pedaling furiously, superimposed over the screen's larger canvas.\nHana is married to Emil, a journalist, who is conscripted by collaborating Czech officials at the radio station where he works to serve as a radio announcer after a colleague, Franta, who will not keep his opinions about the Germans to himself, is taken away by occupying forces and later executed. Emil cooperates to protect his wife from being deported to the death camps. Emil's boss at the radio station is a Nazi sympathizer who offers him the job with the understanding that no one will bother him about his wife.\nSoon, Emil has become popular hosting a cultural program in Prague entitled \"Voices of Our Home\". Meanwhile Hana becomes bored sitting at home and jeopardizes Emil's position by leaving their apartment, usually to attend the cinema. As Hana is rebellious and exasperated, she refuses to accept how risky her position is as a Jew in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia. She is almost arrested leaving the cinema after curfew, rescued by former medical student, now morphine-addicted projectionist, Petr.\nAs tensions arise, Emil begins having an affair with former colleague and former lover of Franta, Vera. Vera is now engaged to his boss, after dumping Franta for not being able to \"listen.\" After figuring out Emil is having an affair, Hana begins seeing Petr more and more, as they both begin to take up the dangerous hobby of Petr taking pictures Hana in front of Anti-Jewish shop signs. He wants to go to bed with her but she resists his advances, eventually allowing him, however, to take pictures of her in the nude. At this point in the film, things slow down considerably as Hana is no longer talking to Emil with the conflict between the two principals, grinding to a halt.\nHana's former film co-star shows up at their apartment having just escaped from a death-transport (he never made it out of Czechoslovakia). Emil is horrified that Hana allows him to take a bath in the apartment and throws him out on the street. Enraged at Emil for throwing her ex-colleague out, Hana dons her blond wig and adopts the persona of her character from her movie and crashes Emil's boss's wedding.

Milan and Goran decide to sell the baby to Lubos and Eman, who are responsible for running an illegal baby adoption center.

Horst, a Czech-German Nazi collaborator married to a German woman and co-worker of Josef, brings food to Josef and his wife Marie, who are Czechs. Josef hates the Nazis. When Josef finds David, who had escaped a concentration camp in occupied Poland after first being sent to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in northern Bohemia, Josef and Marie decide to hide him in their apartment. Horst makes an unannounced visit, bringing presents as usual. Marie is ambivalent about their secret: On one hand she never misses an opportunity to blame her husband for bringing in the Jew, but on the other she is merciful and sympathetic towards the poor kid locked in the closet day and night. She suggests that Josef accept Horst's job offer evicting Czech Jews from their homes, so as to get more protection and deflect possible suspicions. Josef accepts and is considered a collaborator by the neighbor Franta (who had tried to give David over to the Nazi authorities, when he first escaped from a concentration camp). Marie spends the days learning French from David and getting more and more tender toward him. Horst's visits become more frequent, and one afternoon, he attempts to rape Marie.\nJosef gets his fertility tested to confirm a long-time rumor: He can't have children. Humiliated by his earlier antics, Horst takes revenge on Marie by forcing them to provide lodging for his supervisor, a committed Nazi bureaucrat, who had suffered a stroke after Nazis killed his son for deserting the army. Marie refuses to accept him on the grounds that she is pregnant. Unfortunately, the community is well-aware that Josef and Marie are infertile, and Josef proposes that David get Marie pregnant in order to stage a \"miracle\" and avoid further investigation. After much resistance from Marie, she and David have sex. Marie becomes pregnant, and Horst eventually apologizes for his previous behavior.  As the Germans lose ground in World War II, Horst's behavior begins to change. Based on his previous suspicions that someone else is living with Josef and Marie, he redirects German authorities when the latter search the street house by house. Finally, the Germans are defeated and the Czech people take brutal revenge on them.  As the Germans are being driven out, Marie goes into labor. Josef frantically searches for a doctor, but the streets of the city are in chaos and the Nazi-affiliated doctor has already been captured.\nJosef finally finds the new ruling troika which includes his old neighbor Franta as the representative of the Czech Resistance. Unfortunately, Franta remembers him as a collaborator and orders his arrest. Josef protests his innocence and invites them to meet David as proof of his ambivalence towards the Jews, in exchange for a chance to find the Nazi doctor to deliver Marie's baby. In the jails, Josef finds that the doctor has committed suicide but also finds Horst crouched in a corner. Remembering Horst's previous actions that saved David's life, Josef tells the Czech partisan guards that Horst is his doctor. The partisans escort them to Josef's house, driving through the ruins of the city. Horst is able to quickly assume the role of Marie's doctor due to his experience delivering his own sons, much to Marie's initial horror. The partisans still want to see David in order to prove Josef's allegiance, but in the chaos and gunfire, David had hid himself elsewhere. The captain of the partisan unit, a member of the regular Czechoslovak Army, does not believe Josef's story and is about to shoot him, but David shows up at the last minute after Josef's despairing plea: \"Let us be human!\" After they all return to the household, Marie and David's son\nButtoners (Czech: Knoflíkáři) is a 1997 Czech film directed by Petr Zelenka.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nPavel Zajíček - Presenter of Radio 1\nJan Haubert - Guest of Radio 1\nSeisuke Tsukahara - Japanese man with Glasses\nMotohiro Hosoya - Japanese man with Beard\nJunzo Inokuchi - Young Japanese man\n\n\n== Awards ==\nButtoners was awarded the 1997 Czech Lion for Best Film.\n\nThe Tiger award at the Rotterdam IFF, 1997\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nButtoners at IMDb\nThe Idiot Returns (Czech: Návrat idiota; also released as Return of the Idiot) is a 1999 Czech film directed by Saša Gedeon.

He came from a poor background and worked in blue-collar jobs before being accepted as an exceptional talent to study at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague. He took manual jobs also as a student and graduate to keep his personal and creative freedom. He is an amateur boxer, founder of the Boxart group.\nHis life was brutally affected by the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia and he was deeply touched by the sacrifice of Jan Palach. Sozanský was active organizer of various unofficial meetings and artistic activities at the Terezín Memorial or Old Most, demolished for coal mining, throughout the normalization until the fall of the communist regime. Then in the communist prison in Valdice and communist concentration camps at uranium mines in the Příbram District, or in besieged Sarajevo. In his work he consistently commemorates political prisoners and victims of the communist regime (Milada Horáková, Jan Zahradníček, Ivan Martin Jirous, Václav Havel, and others) and refers to literature sources, such as Samuel Beckett's Stories and Texts for Nothing, Orwell's novel 1984, and Václav Havel, Primo Levi's and Rudolf Höss's writings. He is a recipient of the award Knight of Czech Culture, the certificate Participant of the Resistance and Opposition to Communism and was awarded For his extraordinary contribution to the reflection of modern history by the Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes. He is the author of the triptych Jan Palach - Ascension at Karolinum and Memorial to the Victims of the August 1968 Invasion and the Victims of the 1969 Protests for Wenceslas Square.\n\n\n== Life ==\nJiří Sozanský was born on 27 June 1946 in Prague. He was born to parents who met on the barricades during the Prague Uprising and married soon after. He never knew his biological father Ivan Sozansky, who came from Subcarpatian Ukraine. Ivan Sozansky was arrested in 1948 while trying to cross the state border, but managed to escape from prison. It has not been possible to trace whether he was forcibly deported to the Soviet Union after the war. In 1952 a court declared Ivan Sozanský missing.\nJiří grew up with his mother in very poor circumstances and learned early in his childhood that he had to fend for himself. His mother was a trained hairdresser and, thanks to her occupation, had a wealth of social contacts. Later she remarried and moved with Jiří to Pec pod Sněžkou for a time to meet a new partner. She separated from her partner when Jiří was 10 years old. At that time, he spent weekends and part of his holidays with his grandmother Veronika and aunt Milena, where he met a year older Josef Kapín, later boxing champion, with whom he met again as an adult during boxing training. Aunt Milena worked as a curator at the National Gallery, where Jiří sometimes came to see her with his mother and learned about Czech Baroque art. Around the age of 13, his mother arranged a visit of the sculptor Jan Kodet, who first bought his drawing and encouraged him to become an artist.\nAfter graduating from primary school, he trained as a mason in the company Pozemní stavby (Ground Construction) in 1960–1963. Active sportsmen worked as teachers at the school and under the influence of Václav Pšenička Jiří Sozanský started to train weightlifting at the age of 15. The librarian of Pozemní stavby introduced Sozanský to the music theorist Jaromír Paclt, who lent him books by French existentialists and publications on modern world art. Thanks to Paclt, he also met Zbyněk Sekal. Artist of the enterprise Zdeněk Fultner founded an art club for him, provided him with painting materials and supported him in his preparation for studying at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague. After graduating from the apprenticeship, he passed the entrance exams for evening studies at the Václav Hollar School of Graphic Arts, but was dissatisfied with the low standard of the local teachers and left the sc\nWaiter, Scarper! (Czech: Vrchní, prchni!) is a 1981 Czechoslovak comedy film directed by Ladislav Smoljak. It is also known in English as 'Run, Waiter, Run!'.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAt his high school reunion, the mild-mannered Dalibor Vrána learns, to his chagrin, that some of his former classmates own villas and take international vacations. He feels dejected because he merely manages a bookstore, drives a dilapidated three-wheeled Velorex, and is chronically short on cash, in part because he owes alimony to two ex-wives, and a third wife is worried they can't pay their bills. When a drunk stranger in a restaurant mistakes Vrána for a waiter, he sees a silver lining. He starts slipping into restaurants, wearing the old tuxedo he wore to his high school reunion, and settling up the bills of diners whose real waiters have left them hanging. Soon he is able to afford a new car, though he has to hide it from the neighbors, lest they get suspicious, and drives to it in his old one. He can even afford to round up his children from their various mothers and take them on a skiing vacation. But soon the police and the press are onto him, not to mention a slew of indignant authentic waiters.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe idea for the movie came to the scriptwriter Zdeněk Svěrák in the early 1970s, when Svěrák slipped out of the Prague theater Malostranská Beseda, during the intermission of an opening night performance, to eat a quick dinner at U Schnellů, the pub next door. As soon as he entered the pub, he saw a forest of raised hands—impatient diners who wanted to pay and mistook him, because of his dark suit and bowtie, for one of the pub's waiters. Svěrák first offered the script to Jiří Menzel, who passed because he thought the material was too thin for a feature-length film. Svěrák hoped the actor Petr Nárožný would play the Vrána character, but Smoljak worried that Nárožný had become typecast by having played the \"infuriated idiot\" too many times recently, and cast Josef Abrhám instead. Smoljak revised Svěrák's script extensively, dropping, for example, a scene where Vrána escapes from a seafood restaurant because a fishing net on the ceiling drops on his pursuers, and adding a scene in which Vrána flits from one restaurant booth to another, expertly dodging the restaurant's real waiters. Smoljak insisted on filming that scene, as well as a late one, set in Karlovy Vary's Grandhotel Pupp, in a single take, because, he said, \"we wanted the viewer to be able to see for himself every move, to see that coordination, whether it clicks or not.

The focus is on a 20-something couple with unspecified learning difficulties, Olinka (Kateřina Holánová) and Standa (Jan Budař), who are preparing to have sex for the first time. Standa has been receiving advice from his brother Jarda (Martin Pechlát), while Olinka has been given tips and guidance by her friends, the women who live in her apartment block. Standa and Jarda travel to Brno from Brundal for the occasion.\nMeanwhile, in a nearby pub, depressed actor Mirek (Miroslav Donutil) is with psychologist Vlasta (Pavla Tomicová), complaining about his life, and the two presently return to Vlasta's flat together where they have sex, and Vlasta counsels Mirek about the state of his marriage. In the same pub are Jaroslava (Ivana Uhlířová), a young woman who habitually attracts unpleasant men, and her current partner Richard (Marek Daniel), a pretentious and self-absorbed man who is tempted by sexual experimentation and submission. This couple return to Richard's flat in the same apartment block where Richard persuades an unwilling Jaroslava to spank him, alongside other requests. Also in the pub are life-long friends Honza (Pavel Liška) and Pavel (Filip Rajmont). While Honza rambles drunkenly about his desire for various women, Pavel has an undeclared love for Honza.\nAt the house, Olinka is horrified to see her controlling mother return unexpectedly to the flat. Panicking, she administers rohypnol into her mother's coffee, and locks her unconscious in a storage cupboard. Standa arrives and they visit Olinka's friends so Standa can be vetted for their approval. Back down in Olinka's flat, Standa and Olinka share an awkward meal, and then proceed to the bedroom and are extremely nervous, but eventually Olinka manages to initiate sex. Despite Jarda's training, Standa is unable to put on the condom, so they do not use one. Meanwhile Jarda arrives at Olinka's friends' party upstairs to drink with them.\nMeanwhile, Mirek leaves Vlasta's house to go home, but on the way has a drunken argument with his wife on the phone, and ends up walking home to Líšeň in a drunken depression. Honza and Pavel also head home to Pavel's house, and Pavel is perturbed when Honza kisses his cheek while he sleeps. After having sex, Olinka excitedly tells her friends what happened, but at the same time her mother wakes up and sees Standa dancing in his underwear through the keyhole. When Olinka returns to the flat, the two women argue, and Standa flees the flat in panic.\nPavel and Honza leave Pavel's place very early to deliver rohlík to Líšeň, but on the way Pavel takes his eyes off the road and hits Mirek, killing him. Comforting Pavel, Honza confides that his love is returned. Meanwhile, Olinka releases her mother from the pantry, but then locks her in again when Standa returns to her. A voice over confirms that Olinka is pregnant.\n\n\n== External links ==\nNuda v Brně at IMDb\nWolf's Hole (Czech: Vlčí bouda) is a 1986 Czechoslovak science fiction horror film directed by Věra Chytilová.

The retrospective passages, which make up most of the film, span Cimrman's whole \"known\" life, where he interacts with many personalities of Czech and European science and culture in the Belle Époque.

Rudolf Hrušínský plays the starring role and is joined in the cast by others including Josef Abrhám, Daniela Kolářová, and Zita Kabátová.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nDr. Radosta organizes a twelve-apartment swap on request of people interested in the swap of apartment in Prague, which he called \"Ball Lightning\", because it had to take place quickly, energetically and all at once. Doctor Radosta is assisted among those involved in the swap by Mr. Knotek as his assistant engineer Severín, who has a reliable car including home-made car airbags, as a messenger. In order to be able to carry out the \"biggest event in the history of moving\", as the group's organizer describes it, Dr. Radosta unbeknownst the wedding of the older couple engaged Mr. Flieger and Mrs. Opatrná on a different date and place, because they must be married before the swap takes place from legal reasons of the time story happened. For this reason, Mr. Knotek must represent the groom's original witness. The wedding festivities result in a nightly moving exercise organized by the drunken Mr. Knotek, after which especially the punctual inspector Mr. Drahota wants to resign from his swap. Dr. Radosta convinces him to stay among the participants, and Mr. Knotek must personally apologize to everyone for the night's disturbance.\nIn last days before the swap of Mrs. Jechová apartment complicate situation, although she originally had no objections to apartment with family Knotek, she additionally demands the Knotek´s washing machine from them because there is not laundry in the house, and she also demands the replacement of the basement storage cellar, which is in her view be too far and too deep. However, for Mr. Knotek, swap of the basement storage cellars with the unpopular neighbor Klabouch also represents a laborious mutual exchange of their coal. Mrs. Jechová surprisingly praises the attic (for drying the clothes) in the house, when the Knotek´s were afraid of further complications from her about the attic as well.\nEven the moving process itself is not without problems, it seems at first that the whole swap will be ruined by Mrs. Jechová, who refuses to move out because of memories of her deceased husband. In the end, however, she allows herself to be convinced. Another complication is with old opera master Bílek, whom Mr. Knotek cannot wake up and believe he have died. If he were dead, the swap could not take place, because legally he would not voluntarily move out of the apartment. Therefore, together with Doctor Radosta, they decide to move Master Bílek's body covered by duvets on the couch to a new apartment and pretend that he died there. However, the couch in question was previously purchased from Master Bílek by the antiques collector Doctor Ječný who demands his couch. At first, they tries to hide the alleged death of master Bílek to him, but Doctor Ječný won't let himself be brush off. After unpacking the couch, he discovers that the couch has been exchanged for a similar piece by Mr. Flieger and Mrs. Opatrná. They rush to where the second couch has been moved so that no one else will uncover the duvets. However, it is eventually discovered that the master Bílek did not actually die, he was merely fast asleep after an all-night packing. The entire twelve apartments swap will therefore be successful. During the closing credits, we see how Dr. Radosta is planning another swap, this time twenty-four apartment swap, under the name \"Ball Lightning II\" (whereby the names on the diagram belong to the crew members).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBall Lightning at IMDb\nThe Last Butterfly (Czech: Poslední motýl; French: La dernier papillon) is a 1990 Czech–French holocaust drama film directed by Karel Kachyňa based on the book The Last Butterfly by Canadian author Michael Jacot.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nTom Courtenay as Antoine Moreau\nBrigitte Fossey as Věra\nIngrid Held as Michèle\nFreddie Jones as Conductor Karl Rheinberg\nMilan Kňažko as Commandant Gruber\nJosef Kemr as Leo Stadler\nDrahomíra Fialková as Leo Stadler's wife\nPavel Bobek as Silberstein\nJosef Laufer as Petersen\nHana Hegerová as Singer\nLinda Jablonská as Stella\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe movie had a premiere in Czechoslovakia in 1991.

The sweet-tempered Otík works as a truck driver assistant to Mr. Pávek, his older colleague, and practical-minded neighbor. Pávek's family and Otík's aunt Hrabětová take care of Otík, whose parents are dead. However, the two truck coworkers become at odds over Otík's inability to perform even the simplest tasks. Pávek demands that Otík be transferred to assist another driver, who happens to be a choleric and suspicious man named Turek. Rather than work with Turek, Otík decides to accept an offer of employment in Prague but finds he does not fit into city life. After discovering that the transfer of Otík to Prague was a trick by a crooked subordinate of the Dřevoplech company director to get a deal on Otík's large inherited house for his boss, Pávek agrees to give Otík a second chance and retrieves him from the city to resume their work together.\nThe film also follows several subplots, such as the secret romance of Turek's wife with a young veterinarian, the tribulations of an accident-prone but respected doctor who has almost as much trouble with his pessimistic patients as he does with his car, and the desperate deeds of Pávek's teenage son, who has ardent feelings for an attractive local teacher.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nJános Bán as Ota Rákosník\nMarián Labuda as Karel Pávek\nRudolf Hrušínský as Dr. Skružný\nPetr Čepek as Josef Turek\nLibuše Šafránková as Jana Turková\nJan Hartl as Václav Kašpar\nMiloslav Štibich as Vojtěch Kalina\nOldřich Vlach as Jaromír Kunc\nMilada Ježková as Ludmila Hrabětová\nZdeněk Svěrák as Painter Evžen Ryba\nJosef Somr as Director of Dřevoplech\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn the Czech Republic and Slovakia the movie retains a cult following. It's also popular in Hungary where main actor János Bán is from.

He feels dejected because he merely manages a bookstore, drives a dilapidated three-wheeled Velorex, and is chronically short on cash, in part because he owes alimony to two ex-wives, and a third wife is worried they can't pay their bills. When a drunk stranger in a restaurant mistakes Vrána for a waiter, he sees a silver lining. He starts slipping into restaurants, wearing the old tuxedo he wore to his high school reunion, and settling up the bills of diners whose real waiters have left them hanging. Soon he is able to afford a new car, though he has to hide it from the neighbors, lest they get suspicious, and drives to it in his old one. He can even afford to round up his children from their various mothers and take them on a skiing vacation. But soon the police and the press are onto him, not to mention a slew of"

As soon as he entered the pub, he saw a forest of raised hands—impatient diners who wanted to pay and mistook him, because of his dark suit and bowtie, for one of the pub's waiters. Svěrák first offered the script to Jiří Menzel, who passed because he thought the material was too thin for a feature-length film. Svěrák hoped the actor Petr Nárožný would play the Vrána character, but Smoljak worried that Nárožný had become typecast by having played the \"infuriated idiot\" too many times recently, and cast Josef Abrhám instead.

        "content": "Roudnice nad Labem (Czech pronunciation: [ˈroudɲɪtsɛ ˈnad labɛm]; German: Raudnitz an der Elbe) is a town in Litoměřice District in the Ústí nad Labem Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 13,000 inhabitants. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.\nA steel road bridge dating from the early 20th century spans the Elbe in Roudnice nad Labem. Its medieval predecessor was the third oldest stone bridge in Bohemia (after Prague and Písek) and the first bridge to connect both banks of the river. Roudnice nad Labem features a castle of late Romanesque origin, now reconstructed in Baroque style.\n\n\n== Administrative parts ==\nThe village of Podlusky is an administrative part of Roudnice nad Labem.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe initial names Rúdnik and Rúdnica probably come from the iron water of a nearby spring (ruda = 'ore').\n\n\n== Geography ==\nRoudnice nad Labem is located about 15 kilometres (9 mi) southeast of Litoměřice and 37 km (23 mi) north of Prague. It lies in the Lower Ohře Table, in the Polabí lowlands. The highest point is on the hill Hostěraz at 265 m (869 ft) above sea level. The town is situated on the left bank of the Elbe River, which forms the northern municipal border.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nRoudnice nad Labem is one of the oldest Czech towns. The first written mentions of Roudnice are from 1167 and 1176, but archeological excavations in the area confirm existence of a prehistoric settlement. The market settlement quickly became economically important due to its location on the Lusatian road, and in the 13th century, it received town status.\nIn the 12th century, a Romanesque castle was built, used as the summer residence of archbishops and bishops.\nIn 1333, Bishop Jan IV of Dražice ordered that a bridge be built over the Elbe. It was the first stone bridge over the Elbe and the third stone bridge in Bohemia. \nAt the end of the 14th century, the New Town of Roudnice nad Labem (encompassing today's Jan of Dražice Square and Hus Square) was built and, along with the Old Town of Roudnice nad Labem, surrounded by walls. In 1421, during the Hussite Wars, Roudnice nad Labem was conquered by Jan Žižka. During the Hussite invasions, the local monastery was destroyed and would never be rebuilt. After the Hussite Wars, the town was sold several times, which did not benefit its development. In 1603, it was acquired by the Lobkowicz family and it remained under their control until 1945. During their rule, the town was rebuilt and expanded. During the Thirty Years' War, Roudnice nad Labem was burned down and demolished by the Swedish army.\nIn the 19th century, Roudnice nad Labem became the industrial and economical centre of the Podřipský region, due to several new factories and the railway from Prague to Dresden. Until 1918, the town was part of Austria-Hungary, in the district of the same name, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Bohemia.\nThe first football match in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and in the Czech lands took place on the islet in the middle of the Elbe, located within the town limits, in 1887 (in 1892, according to some sources). In 1910, the old stone bridge was rebuilt into a new steel road bridge.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n== Transport ==\nThe D8 motorway from Prague to Ústí nad Labem runs along the western municipal border.\nRoudnice nad Labem is located on the intraregional railway line Prague–Děčín. It is also the starting point of a local line to Bříza with four stops within the town.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThere are four high schools in Roudnice nad Labem: Gymnasium Roudnice nad Labem, Vocational School and Training Centre, Podřipská Private Vocational School and Training Centre, and Higher Vocational School and Secondary Vocational School, which also offers higher education. There are also five primary schools, including one special school, and a primary art school.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nThe town has a swimming pool, an ice hockey arena, and football and athletic stadiums. Rou\nÚstí nad Labem Region or Ústecký Region (Czech: Ústecký kraj) is an administrative unit (kraj) of the Czech Republic, located in the north-western part of the historical land of Bohemia, and named after the capital, Ústí nad Labem. It covers the majority of the former North Bohemia province (Czech: Severočeský kraj) and is part of the broader area of North Bohemia.\nThe region borders the regions of Liberec (east), Central Bohemia (south), Plzeň (southwest), Karlovy Vary (west) and the German region of Saxony to the north.\nThe Ústí nad Labem Region comprises a range of very different types of landscape. Between the high escarpment of the Ore Mountains range and the Bohemian Central Uplands with many volcanic hills, there are vast areas devastated by surface coal mining (the Most Basin), partly being recultivated into an artificial landscape with ponds, plains and groves. The Elbe river runs through the Central Uplands in a winding gorge of the Porta Bohemica. The southern part of the region, Polabí, is flat and fertile, while in the northeast are the sandstone formations of Bohemian Switzerland, including the monumental Pravčická brána, a natural sandstone arch.\nThe geographical location of the area, between Prague and Germany, has been a significant factor in the region's development.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe Ústí nad Labem Region is divided into 7 districts:\n\nThe districts are further subdivided into 16 administrative district of municipalities with extended competence.\n\n\n== Population ==\nAs of 1 January 2019, the region had 820,789 inhabitants, the fifth most populous in the Czech Republic. The population density is higher than the national average, and the region is the fourth most densely populated in the country. The most densely populated areas of the region are the areas on the brown coal basin while areas with a lower population density are the Ore Mountains and the Louny District and Litoměřice District, which predominantly contain smaller country settlements. The largest municipality is Ústí nad Labem, the region's seat, with 92,952 inhabitants.\nThe Ústí nad Labem region has the third youngest population; the average age is 42.0 years. The Ústí nad Labem Region ranks second-highest in the Czech Republic in the number of live births per 1,000 inhabitants, alongside the Liberec Region (11.5), but also has one of the highest mortality rates (10.6 deaths per 1,000 inhabitants). The Ústí nad Labem Region ranks second nationally in the number of divorces per 1,000 inhabitants (3.4) and first in the number of abortions per 100 live births (47.5).\nThe region has 46 cities and towns, in which 80.7% of its inhabitants reside, and 354 villages. 54% of the region's villages have a population greater than 500, but only 5.8% of the region's inhabitants live there.\nThe composition of the population according to nationality is:\n\nCzech: 92.12%\nSlovak: 2.71%\nGerman: 1.25%\nRomani: 0.23%\nPolish: 0.2%\nMoravian: 0.13%\nOther: 3.45%\n\n\n=== Cities and towns ===\nThe table shows cities and towns in the region that had more than 10,000 inhabitants (as of 1 January 2024).

The territory extends into three geomorphological mesoregions: Lower Ohře Table (south), Central Bohemian Uplands (north) and Ralsko Uplands (east). The highest point of the district is the mountain Milešovka in Velemín with an elevation of 837 m (2,746 ft), the lowest point is the river bed of the Elbe in Prackovice nad Labem at 143 m (469 ft). A dominant feature of the southern part of the district is the Říp Mountain.\nFrom the total district area of 1,032.4 km2 (398.6 sq mi), agricultural land occupies 731.5 km2 (282.4 sq mi), forests occupy 170.2 km2 (65.7 sq mi), and water area occupies 18.8 km2 (7.3 sq mi). Forests cover 16.5% of the district's area.\nThe most important rivers are the Elbe and its tributary Ohře, which drain the entire territory. The largest body of water is Žernosecké Lake, an artificial lake created by flooding sandstone quarry.

Convicted of these crimes and two attempted murders, he was sentenced to death and subsequently executed in 1938.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nSvatoslav Štěpánek was born on 25 December 1911, in Roudnice nad Labem, the youngest of four children. He came from a respected family – his father was a chemist in a sugar factory and his mother a retired kindergarten teacher. Svatoslav, who suffered from meningitis soon after his premature birth and was physically weak, was doted upon by his mother. His father died when he was still young, prompting his mother to move him and his three siblings to the Slovakian part of the country, where they remained for some time. After returning to Roudnice nad Labem, Štěpánek studied to become a gardener but never took any work.\nIn contrast to his siblings, Svatoslav was despised by other residents of his neighbourhood due to his odd and disconcerting behaviour: besides stealing items such as women's underwear, he also enjoyed dissecting frogs, liked to torture and kill animals, and visited the local cemetery to watch the gravedigger work. Štěpánek was also known for biting his classmates and relishing in their pain, and in the fifth grade, he is also said to have stabbed a classmate with a knife following an argument. In 1930, he was threatened with up to a year in prison for a theft, but his mother prevented it by arranging a psychiatric examination with a friend, who deduced that Štěpánek had mental issues. After the exam, the man also told his mother that the teenager had serious psychological issues and should seek immediate treatment, but Štěpánek's mother dismissed his advice.\n\n\n== First murder ==\nŠtěpánek's first known murder took place in 1926 when he was still 16. On one occasion when he was left to watch over his sister, Štěpánek was visited by 5-year-old Bedřich Brožovský, the son of a couple who shared a rented apartment with him. It's unclear what exactly occurred on the day of the murder, but according to Štěpánek, he had become annoyed with Brožovský, luring him to the cellar where he hit him on the head with a hammer multiple times. In order to dispose of the body, he dismembered it and buried it in his garden. He would later be questioned about Brožovský's mysterious disappearance but claimed to know nothing of it. After some time, the local townsfolk and police alike came to the conclusion that little Bedřich had likely been kidnapped by a gang of gypsies, and with no leads, the case went cold.\n\n\n== New crimes ==\n\n\n=== Attempted murders ===\nAfter an apparent 10-year lull, when he is not known to have committed any crimes, Štěpánek resumed his violent activities on 10 January 1936. On that day, while riding his bicycle around Roudnice nad Labem, he spotted 13-year-old Růžena Jebavá walking home from school. Štěpánek rode up to her, drew out his pistol and shot her in the left shoulder blade, narrowly missing her heart. With Jebavá left writhing on the ground, he rode a little further before suddenly returning, telling her \"Here you go\", and leaving again. She was found by passers-by and rushed to the hospital, where an early intervention by doctors saved her life.\nThirteen days later, 26-year-old Zdeňka Drobná came across Štěpánek, who was repairing his bicycle on the road, while en route home from visiting her husband in the hospital. When she went past him, Štěpánek went after her and knocked her into a nearby ditch, whereupon he began swearing at and threatening her. Drobná got up and tried to run away, but Štěpánek caught up with her again and aimed his pistol directly at her heart. She instinctively slapped his hand, causing him to fire a shot into her stomach. Despite successfully injuring his victim and about to finish her off with an axe, a passing witness scared off Ště\nHigh-speed rail in the Czech Republic is being planned with construction starting in 2026 and maximum speed between 200 and 320 km/h. Although České Dráhy owns and operates multiple rolling stock capable of speeds of 230 km/h (143 mph) since 2004, there is, as of 2023, no infrastructure capable of velocity over 200 km/h (124 mph). The only exception is the 13.3-kilometre long track at Velim railway test circuit with a maximum allowed speed of 230 km/h (143 mph) for tilting trains and up to 210 km/h (130 mph) for conventional trains. Czech rolling stock manufacturer Škoda Transportation has produced high-speed rolling stock since the 1970s.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\nThe basis for Czech high-speed rail was laid down in 2017 when the Government approved the High-Speed Rail Development Program. According to this program, the following routes, referred to as \"RS\", (standing for rychlá spojení, fast connections) will be developed:\n\nRS1: Prague–Brno–Ostrava–(Katowice)\nRS2: Brno–Břeclav–(Vienna/Bratislava)\nRS3: Prague–Plzeň–(Munich)\nRS4: Prague–Ústí nad Labem–(Dresden)\nRS5: Prague–Liberec/Hradec Králové–(Wrocław)\nThe development will include the construction of new lines as well as upgrade existing lines to 200 km/h (124 mph). New high-speed routes will consist of the following shorter sections:\n\n\n=== Pilot projects ===\nIn 2018 SŽDC identified following three shorter sections as pilot projects:\n\nVRT Polabí (HST Polabí) – Prague – Poříčany (30 km) – part of future RS1 and RS5\nVRT Jižní Morava (HST South Moravia) – Brno – Vranovice – part of future RS2\nVRT Moravská brána (HST Moravian Gate) – Přerov – Ostrava – part of future RS1\n\n\n=== Train stations planning ===\nAlong the high-speed route RS1 (Prague-Brno-Ostrava), several new train stations are planned. Just south to the D11 motorway in the town of Nehvizdy in the Prague-East District, the new Prague East Terminal (Terminál Praha východ) is being planned. This station will be a transport hub as a part of the RS1 and RS5 (Prague-Liberec/Hradec Králové) routes and will mainly serve residents of the northeastern part of the Central Bohemian Region. Along RS1, the high-speed line will be connected via a branch line to the train station of Světlá nad Sázavou, which will be reconstructed.\nClose to highway exit 112 on the D1 motorway in the Jihlava District, a new Jihlava train station (terminál Jihlava VRT) is planned as part of RS1. This station will also be connected to the regional railway between Jihlava and Havlíčkův Brod and serve as a transport hub for the Vysočina Region. Another new station to the west of Velká Bíteš is planned on a branch line from the RS1 towards the regional railway between Havlíčkův Brod and Brno.\nIn the south of Brno, the new train station Brno-Vídeňská is planned to serve the region around Brno and to prevent unnecessary traffic to Brno main railway station in the city centre.\nOne new train station is planned along the high-speed route RS4 (Prague – Ústí nad Labem). This new train station (Terminál Roudnice nad Labem VRT) will be constructed to the west of Roudnice nad Labem and will serve as a transfer hub in the Litoměřice District.\nSŽ is also considering upgrading of some ETCS-equipped 160 km/h (99 mph) tracks to 200 km/h (124 mph) and also upgrading some current 160 km/h (99 mph) projects to 200 km/h (124 mph). In 2020 SŽ called for bids to upgrade ongoing 9 km (6 mi) Soběslav – Doubí project and 20 km (12 mi) Sudoměřice – Votice project to 200 km/h (124 mph), both projects are on Prague – České Budějovice route.\n\n\n== Rolling stock operated in the Czech Republic ==\n\nSince 2004 České dráhy have been operating seven ČD Class 680 sets. These Pendolino-based trains are capable of operating at 230 km/h (143 mph) and were intended for operation on the Berlin – Prague – Vienna route. While testing from Břeclav to Brno on 18 November 2004, the ČD Class 680 reached a speed of 237 km/h (147 mph) and created a new Czech railway speed record.

It was the predecessor state of the modern Czech Republic.\nThe Kingdom of Bohemia was an Imperial State in the Holy Roman Empire. The Bohemian king was a prince-elector of the empire. The kings of Bohemia, besides the region of Bohemia itself, also ruled other lands belonging to the Bohemian Crown, which at various times included Moravia, Silesia, Lusatia, and parts of Saxony, Brandenburg, and Bavaria.\nThe kingdom was established by the Přemyslid dynasty in the 12th century by the Duchy of Bohemia, later ruled by the House of Luxembourg, the Jagiellonian dynasty, and from 1526 the House of Habsburg and its successor, the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. Numerous kings of Bohemia were also elected Holy Roman Emperors, and the capital, Prague, was the imperial seat in the late 14th century, and again at the end of the 16th and the beginning of the 17th centuries.\nShortly before the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the kingdom became part of the newly proclaimed Habsburg Austrian Empire, and subsequently the Austro-Hungarian Empire from 1867. Bohemia retained its name and formal status as a separate Kingdom of Bohemia until 1918, known as a crown land within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and its capital Prague was one of the empire's leading cities. The Czech language (called the Bohemian language in English usage until the 19th century) was the main language of the Diet and the nobility until 1627 (after the Bohemian Revolt was suppressed). German was then formally made equal with Czech and eventually prevailed as the language of the Diet until the Czech National Revival in the 19th century. German was also widely used as the language of administration in many towns after the Germans immigrated and populated some areas of the country in the 13th century. The royal court used the Czech, Latin, and German languages, depending on the ruler and period.\nFollowing the defeat of the Central Powers in World War I, both the Kingdom and Empire were dissolved. Bohemia became the core part of the newly formed Czechoslovak Republic.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 13th century (growth) ===\nAlthough some former rulers of Bohemia had enjoyed a non-hereditary royal title during the 11th and 12th centuries (Vratislaus II, Vladislaus II), the kingdom was formally established in 1198 by Přemysl Ottokar I, who had his status acknowledged by Philip of Swabia, elected King of the Romans, in return for his support against the rival Emperor Otto IV. In 1204 Ottokar's royal status was accepted by Otto IV as well as by Pope Innocent III. It was officially recognized in 1212 by the Golden Bull of Sicily issued by Emperor Frederick II, elevating the Duchy of Bohemia to Kingdom status and proclaiming its independence which was also later bolstered by future king of Bohemia and emperor Charles IV, with his golden bull in 1356.\nUnder these terms, the Czech king was to be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in the imperial councils. The imperial prerogative to ratify each Bohemian ruler and to appoint the bishop of Prague was revoked. The king's successor was his son Wenceslaus I, from his second marriage.\n\nWenceslaus I's sister Agnes, later canonized, refused to marry the Holy Roman Emperor and instead devoted her life to spiritual works. Corresponding with the Pope, she established the Knights of the Cross with the Red Star in 1233, the first military order in the Kingdom of Bohemia. Four other military orders were present in Bohemia: the Order of St. John of Jerusalem from c. 1160; the Order of Saint Lazarus from the late 12th century; the Teutonic Order from c. 1200–1421; and the Knights Templar from 1232 to 1312.\n\nThe 13th century was the most dynamic period of the Přemyslid reign over Bohemia.

It has about 200 inhabitants.\nČerněves lies approximately 13 kilometres (8 mi) south-east of Litoměřice, 27 km (17 mi) south-east of Ústí nad Labem, and 43 km (27 mi) north of Prague. It is about 3 km from Roudnice nad Labem.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nJana Komrsková (born 6 May 1983 in Roudnice nad Labem) is an artistic gymnast from the Czech Republic who competed in the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nKomrsková was born on 6 May 1983 to father Jan Komrska, a gymnastics coach, and mother Zdena Komrsková (née Dorňáková), a 1972 Olympian. She started gymnastics at the age of four and was coached by her parents in Zlín. Her younger sister, Aneta, also competed in gymnastics, while her older sister, Lucie, was a leading Czech long jumper.\n\n\n== Gymnastics career ==\nAt the age of 10, Komrsková became a member of the Czech national junior team, and in 1995, she participated in the European Junior Championships for the first time. Two years later, she won three titles in the senior national championships in 1997, including the all-around title, with particularly strong performances on the uneven bars and vault.\n\n\n=== 1999–2000 ===\nAt the 1999 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Tianjin, Komrsková qualified to the all-around final in ninth place, but major faults on beam sent her back to 33rd in the all-around final. The Czech team finished in 16th place, qualifying two gymnasts to the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.\nIn the Olympic year, Komrsková recorded her first success in a World Cup competition (second place on vault in Cottbus, behind Russia's Yelena Produnova) and finished ninth in the all-around at the 2000 European Championships.\nShe and Kateřina Marešová competed for the Czech Republic at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Komrsková qualified for the individual all-around final in 29th place despite an infection contracted through blisters on her forearm. Immediately after the final, she underwent minor surgery.\nAfter the Games, Komrsková placed fourth on uneven bars and vault at the World Cup final in Glasgow.\n\n\n=== 2001–2004 ===\nFollowing several podium finishes in World Cup events, Komrsková was one of the favorites for the vault title at the 2001 World Championships in Ghent. She advanced to the final and finished fourth behind Svetlana Khorkina, Oksana Chusovitina, and Andreea Răducan, losing the bronze medal to Răducan by 0.037 points.\nKomrsková was the stand-by for the uneven bars final at the 2002 European Championships and the vault final at the 2003 World Championships, missing the former by 0.012. Her 11th-place finish in the all-around at the 2002 European Championships was her top result in those two years. At the 2003 Worlds in Anaheim, California, she clinched the only Czech berth for the 2004 Summer Olympics, but injured her elbow in the process. At the end of the year, she also broke bones in her foot. She missed the 2004 national and European championships but recovered in time for the Olympics in Athens.\nAt the Olympics, Komrsková finished 32nd in the all-around qualification and was the second alternate for the final. She said afterward: \"When I was in the Olympic Games before, I was younger and I was a bit overwhelmed. Now, it's a normal competition for me. I still think the Olympics is the most important competition for an athlete, but now I am a lot more relaxed about it.\"\n\n\n=== 2005–2008 ===\nAfter the 2004 Olympics, Komrsková decided to end her gymnastics career and try pole vaulting, following the example of Daniela Bártová, a former Czech gymnast who went on to set pole vaulting records. However, Komrsková was hindered by her elbow injury. She then tried to join her sister Lucie in long jumping, but ultimately decided to return to gymnastics.\nHer parents had retired from coaching, so Komrsková began training with the Czech national team coach, Stanislav Vyzina, in Brno. She returned to national competitions in late 2005 and went on to win her first World Cup title: a gold medal on vault at the B-category World Cup in Maribor, Slovenia. In 2006, she performed well at several World Cup events, winning gold on vault and bronze on balance beam in Maribor, and silver on vault in Moscow and Lyon.\nAt the 2006 European Championships in Volos, Gr\nThe Elbe (German: [ˈɛlbə] ; Czech: Labe [ˈlabɛ] ; Low German: Ilv or Elv; Upper and Lower Sorbian: Łobjo, pronounced [ˈwɔbʲɔ]) is one of the major rivers of Central Europe. It rises in the Giant Mountains of the northern Czech Republic before traversing much of Bohemia (western half of the Czech Republic), then Germany and flowing into the North Sea at Cuxhaven, 110 kilometres (68 miles) northwest of Hamburg. Its total length is 1,094 km (680 mi).\nThe Elbe's major tributaries include the rivers Vltava, Saale, Havel, Mulde, Schwarze Elster, and Ohře.\nThe Elbe river basin, comprising the Elbe and its tributaries, has a catchment area of 148,268 square kilometres (57,247 sq mi), the twelfth largest in Europe. The basin spans four countries; however, it lies almost entirely just in two of them, Germany (65.5%) and the Czech Republic (33.7%, covering about two thirds of the nation's territory). On its southeastern edges, the Elbe river basin also comprises small parts of Austria (0.6%) and Poland (0.2%). The Elbe catchment area is inhabited by 24.4 million people; its biggest cities are Berlin, Hamburg, Prague, Dresden and Leipzig.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n \nFirst attested in Latin as Albis, the name Elbe means \"river\" or \"river-bed\" and is nothing more than the High German version of a word (*albī) found elsewhere in Germanic; cf. Old Norse river name Elfr, Swedish älv \"river\", Norwegian elv \"river\", Old English river name elf, and Middle Low German elve \"river-bed\".\n\n\n== Course ==\n\n\n=== In the Czech Republic ===\nThe Elbe (Labe) rises on the slopes of Mt. Violík at an elevation of 1,386 metres (4,547 ft) in the Giant Mountains on the northwest borders of the Czech Republic. Of the numerous small streams whose waters compose the infant river. After plunging down the 30 metres (98 ft) of the Elbe Falls, the latter stream unites with the steeply torrential Bílé Labe, and thereafter the united stream of the Elbe pursues a southerly course, emerging from the mountain glens at Jaroměř, where it receives Úpa and Metuje.\nHere the Elbe enters the vast vale named Polabí (meaning \"land along the Elbe\"), and continues on southwards through Hradec Králové (where Orlice flows in) and then to Pardubice, where it turns sharply to the west. At Kolín some 43 kilometres (27 mi) further on, it bends gradually towards the north-west. At the village of Káraný, a little above Brandýs nad Labem, the Jizera enters in.\nAt Mělník its stream is more than doubled in volume by the Vltava, a major river which winds northwards through Bohemia. Upstream from the confluence the Vltava is in fact much longer (434 kilometres (270 mi) against 294 kilometres (183 mi) of the Elbe so far), and has a greater discharge and a larger drainage basin. Nonetheless, for historical reasons the river retains the name Elbe, also because at the confluence point it is the Elbe that flows through the main, wider valley while the Vltava flows into the valley to meet the Elbe at almost a right angle, and thus appears to be the tributary river.\nSome distance lower down, at Litoměřice, the waters of the Elbe are tinted by the reddish Ohře. Thus augmented, and swollen into a stream 140 metres (460 ft) wide, the Elbe carves a path through the basaltic mass of the České Středohoří, churning its way through a picturesque, deep, narrow and curved rocky gorge.\n\n\n=== In Germany ===\nShortly after crossing the Czech-German frontier, and passing through the sandstone defiles of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains, the stream assumes a north-westerly direction, which on the whole it preserves right to the North Sea.\nThe river rolls through Dresden and finally, beyond Meissen, enters on its long journey across the North German Plain passing along the former western border of East Germany, touching Torgau, Wittenberg, Dessau, Magdeburg, Wittenberge, and Hamburg on the way, and taking on the waters of the Mulde and Saale from the west, and those of the Schwarze Elster, Havel and Elde from the east.

Liga.\nThroughout his career, he played 45 matches for Czechoslovakia as a forward between 1970 and 1983, scoring 11 goals. He was a participant in the 1982 FIFA World Cup.\nHe played for FK Teplice and later spent his best football years at Bohemians Praha.\nBičovský later began a coaching career with ASK Ybbs, FK Teplice, FC Chomutov, Lokomotíva Česká Lípa, SK Buldoci Karlovy Vary-Dvory, SIAD Braňany, FK SIAD Most, Chmel Blšany, MFK Ružomberok, SK Roudnice nad Labem and FC Zenit Čáslav.\n\n\n== References ==\nThe Roudnice Altarpiece is a three-part winged altar from the provost's church in Roudnice nad Labem, one of the oldest completely preserved Gothic retables from the period around 1410-1420. It is on display in the permanent exhibition of the National Gallery in Prague.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Roudnice triptych with the Death of the Virgin Mary was probably intended for the monastery church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary of the Augustinian Canons in Roudnice nad Labem. It survived the sack of the monastery by Jan Žižka's army in 1421. However, it is also possible that it was made in Prague for an educated burgher and did not reach Roudnice until after the Hussite Wars. It was found in the Roudnice church in the form of separately hanging panels and was first mentioned in the 19th century by J. E. Wocel. In 1928 it was purchased for the Picture Gallery of the Society of Patriotic Friends of Art and restored for exhibition purposes.\nKarel Chytil (1906) has determined the panels as parts of one altarpiece. He also identified the king kneeling at the feet of the Virgin Mary with Wenceslaus IV and dated the painting to the last decade of the 14th century.\nThe modern detailed technological research shows that the altar was created before the outbreak of the Hussite Wars and is thus probably the oldest completely preserved Czech wing altar after the altar from Mühlhausen and the small altarpiece - the so-called Cibulka triptych.\n\n\n== Description and classification ==\nThe three parts of the altar are painted in tempera on a chalk ground, on lime wood panels. The central panel is covered with linen, the outer wings with a chalk ground on wood, the framing is non-original. The central panel measures 147 x 118.5 cm, the wings of the same height are 45 cm wide (with the original frame surviving to the 19th century they were 75 cm wide). The underdrawing is both brush and engraved; linseed oil was also used as a binder for the coloured glazes.\nThe central scene with the Death of the Virgin Mary is an example of the so-called Good Death, and the composition later spread from Bohemia to neighbouring countries. It depicts Mary kneeling on her bed during her last prayer, accompanied by the Apostles, led by St. Peter. In front is a group of three kneeling apostles with a book. The richly decorated bedspread with a brocade pattern on a gilded ground links the work to the Nuremberg painting. The background is gilded, with Gothic architecture in the upper part.\nOn the left wing is the Madonna Protectress with a crown on her head and an open blue protective cloak, under which groups of four supplicants kneel on each side. In the foreground on the left is the Pope with a tiara, on the right the King with a crown in period dress (probably Wenceslaus IV) and behind them representatives of various estates. It is clear that the commissioner came from a Catholic (not Reformed) background.\nThe right wing depicts the Sorrowful Christ with exposed wounds, also with a protective cloak, under which eight supplicants are hiding. In the foreground a young bishop in a pluvial and mitre kneels on the right, and on the left a young canon wearing an alb that resembles a Premonstratensian or Augustinian habit. The motif of Christ the Protector is quite unique and, apart from one illumination and one mural in South Tyrol, has no iconographic equivalent.\nThe back of the wings depict Sorrowful Christ with a loincloth and the insignia of the Passion, and the Sorrowful Virgin Mary with a white veil on her head. At the bottom of both paintings are kneeling figures of unknown donors - on the right a burgher with four sons, on the left his wife with four daughters. The paintings on the back of the altar are probably the work of a younger assistant. They are characterised by a more expressive colouring and greater drama in their depiction of the state of mind and physical suffering that is typical of the next period of Gothic painting.\nThe Roudnice Altarpiece is one of the m\nKarel Nepraš (2 April 1932 – 5 April 2002) was a Czech sculptor, draughtsman, graphic artist and professor at Prague Academy. Already in the 1960s, Nepraš became one of the most prominent Czech artists thanks to his ability to master new materials, techniques and technologies and creatively exploit them. His original work has also been recognized abroad. Through playfulness, subversive irony and bitter humour, he has kept himself free from pathos, pretension and any ideological cliché. Nepraš's work is often classified as part of the so-called Czech Grotesque, which partly overlapped with New Figuration, but the term was rather a substitute for such notions as alienation, absurdity and manipulation, which were unacceptable to the then communist regime. With the rapid deterioration of state cultural policy under normalization, the grotesque acted as a distinctly intellectual commentary on reality. According to art historian Jan Kříž, there are only a few sculptors in the world who could so perfectly connect the tragicomedy of human existence with the tragicomedy of general history.\nThe period of normalization he experienced in difficult existential conditions, without the possibility to exhibit and in seclusion. He received recognition again only after the the fall of the communist regime, when he was appointed professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague. A number of prominent personalities emerged from the Karel Nepraš School Socha 1, such as the sculptors Paulina Skavova, Martina Hozová, Klára Klose and Markéta Korečková, the sculptors Karel Bartáček, Zdeněk Šmíd, Vít Novotný, Ján Macko and the painter MICL. In addition to teaching students, Nepraš devoted himself intensively to his own work and is considered one of the most original representatives of New Figuration.\n\n\n== Life ==\nKarel Nepraš was born on 2 April 1932 in Prague. He was born into the family of a bank clerk. Thanks to his art teacher at the town school, who encouraged his interest in drawing and advised him, he saw several exhibitions before the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état. In 1948–1951, he graduated from the Secondary Industrial Ceramic School in Prague, where Bedřich Dlouhý also studied. In 1952 he was admitted to the Academy of Fine Arts in the sculpture studio of Prof. Jan Lauda, and in 1958 he graduated as an academic sculptor.\nBefore the war, Jan Lauda was a leading representative of so-called social art and had excellent training (pupil of Jan Štursa, shared studio with Otto Gutfreund). He was a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and in 1951 he was awarded the State Prize of Klement Gottwald for his bust of V. I. Lenin. Karel Nepraš was a prominent student of Lauda, and his professor actively protected him, giving him repeatedly excellent marks in sculpture. He also saved him from being expelled from Academy when Nepraš repeatedly failed exams in Marxism-Leninism and Lauda convinced the examining comrade to give him at least a C. At the end of his studies he defended Nepraš's diploma thesis - an unconventional monument to the pioneer of aeronautics E. Čihák. From the practice of the ceramicist and the principles of the Lauda school on the necessity to maintain the solid construction of the sculpture, Nepraš took away the inclination towards a convex shape, which \"is the vault that holds the space\"\n\n\n==== Šmidra group ====\nIn the oppressive atmosphere of the communist regime of the 1950s, the general spying and the emphasis on teaching Marxism–Leninism and socialist realism at the Academy, personal friendships and private gatherings of students were more important than school. Nepraš and his friends were aware that they stood completely outside official art, and prank was a necessary common self-defence.\nTogether with his classmates Jan Koblasa, Bedřich Dlouhý and musicians Rudolf Komorous, Libor Pešek and Jan Klusák, he founded the Club (in the manner of English gentlemen's clubs), which prepared a joint Dadaist event of artists, acto\nA ring diacritic may appear above or below letters. It may be combined with some letters of the extended Latin alphabets in various contexts.\n\n\n== Rings ==\n\n\n=== Distinct letter ===\nThe character Å (å) is derived from an A with a ring. It is a distinct letter in the Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, Walloon, and Chamorro alphabets. For example, the 29-letter Swedish alphabet begins with the basic 26 Latin letters and ends with the three letters Å, Ä, and Ö.\n\n\n=== Overring ===\n\nThe character Ů (ů) a Latin U with overring, or kroužek is a grapheme in Czech preserved for historic reasons, and represented a vowel shift. For example, the word for \"horse\" used to be written kóň, which evolved, along with pronunciation, into kuoň. Ultimately, the vowel [o] disappeared completely, and the uo evolved into ů, modern form kůň. The letter ů now has the same pronunciation as the letter ú (long [uː]), but changes to a short o when a word is morphed (e.g. nom. kůň → gen. koně, nom. dům → gen. domu), thus showing the historical evolution of the language. Ů cannot occur in initial position, while ú occurs almost exclusively in initial position or at the beginning of a word root in a compound, a common example of this is the word for \"triangle\" trojúhelník. These characters are used also in Steuer's Silesian alphabet. The [uo] pronunciation has prevailed in some Moravian dialects, as well as in Slovak, which uses the letter ô instead of ů.\nThe ring is used in some dialects of Emilian and Romagnol to distinguish the sound /ʌ/ (å) from /a/ (a).\nů was used in Old Lithuanian in Lithuania Minor from the 16th till the beginning of the 20th century and for a shorter time in 16th-century Lithuania Major for diphthong [uo].\nThe ring was used in the Lithuanian Cyrillic alphabet promoted by Russian authorities in the last quarter of the 19th century with the letter У̊ / у̊  used to represent the /wɔ/ diphthong (now written uo in Lithuanian orthography).\nẘ and ẙ are used in the ISO 233 romanization of the Arabic alphabet. A fatḥah followed by the letter ⟨ﻭ⟩ (wāw) with a sukūn (ـَوْ) is romanized as aẘ. A fatḥah followed by the letter ⟨ﻱ⟩ (yā’) with a sukūn over it (ـَيْ) is romanized as aẙ.\nRing upon e (e̊) is used by certain dialectologists of Walloon (especially Jean-Jacques Gaziaux) to note the /ə/ vowel typically replacing /i/ and /y/ in the Brabant province central Walloon dialects. The difficulty of type-writing it has led some writers to prefer ë for the same sound.\nMany more characters can be created in Unicode using the combining character U+030A ◌̊ COMBINING RING ABOVE, including the above-mentioned у̊ (Cyrillic у with overring) or ń̊ (n with acute and overring).\nThe standalone (spacing) symbol is U+02DA ˚ RING ABOVE.\nThe unrelated, but nearly identical degree symbol is U+00B0 ° DEGREE SIGN.\nAlthough similar in appearance, it is not to be confused with the Japanese handakuten (U+309A ◌゚ COMBINING KATAKANA-HIRAGANA SEMI-VOICED SOUND MARK), a diacritic used with the kana for syllables starting with h to indicate that they should instead be pronounced with [p]. In Japanese dialectology, handakuten is used with kana for syllables starting with k to indicate their consonant is [ŋ], with syllables starting with r to indicate their consonant is l though this does not change the pronunciation, with kana u to indicate its morph into kana n, and with kana i to indicate the vowel is to be said as [ɨ].\nIn Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics, there are two ring characters: ᐤ (Cree and Ojibwe final w, or Sayisi o) and ᣞ (Cree and Ojibwe final w or final y).  This second smaller ring can combine as a diacritic ring above in Moose Cree and Moose-Cree influenced Ojibwe as a final y;  in Inuktitut, the ring above the /_i/ character turns it into a /_aai/ character.  In Western Cree, /_w_w/ sequence is represented as ᐝ.\nIn addition to the combining character option, Unicode has some precomposed characters:\n\n\n=== Underring ===\n\nThe underring is used in IPA to indicate \nTomas Sedlacek (born 23 January 1977 in Prague) gained widespread international recognition for his book on philosophy and economy \"Economics of Good and Evil\" (Oxford University Press), which has been translated into 22 languages.

In Switzerland, he was listed among the top 100 influential global thinkers (Top 100 Thought Leaders, GDI). \nBorn in 1977 in Prague, Czechoslovakia, Sedlacek grew up in Helsinki, Finland, and was educated in Copenhagen, Denmark. At the age of 24, Sedlacek became an economic advisor of Czech president Václav Havel until the end of his term in office. He went back to academia and has written case studies with Harvard University and Georgetown University. Later, he served as a non-political economic advisor to the Minister of Finance and deputy Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, responsible for fiscal reform, pensions and health care reform and a number of tax reforms (VAT, personal income tax and corporate tax). He was responsible for negotiations with The World Bank and OECD. He toured the world on a roadshow for the inaugural Czech Eurobond emission. Afterwards, he received fellowship at Yale University as a Yale World Fellow 2006, during this time Yale Economic Review ranked him among the Five Hot Young Guns in Economics. For sixteen years, he worked as a Chief Macroeconomic Strategist at a major Czech bank, CSOB. Later, he became a founding and long term member of the National Economic Council, an advisory body to the Government of Czech Republic (NERV). \nTomas Sedlacek was a member of the Program Council for New Economic Thinking of World Economic Forum that meets in Davos and a member of an advisory body to EC president Barroso on New Narrative for Europe.

It has about 2,200 inhabitants. It lies on the Ohře River. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.\n\n\n== Administrative parts ==\nThe villages of Břežany nad Ohří, Kostelec nad Ohří, Nížebohy, Písty, Roudníček and Vrbka are administrative parts of Budyně nad Ohří.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name Budyně is derived from the personal name Buda, meaning \"Buda's (village)\".\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBudyně nad Ohří is located about 15 kilometres (9 mi) south of Litoměřice and 38 km (24 mi) northwest of Prague. It lies in a flat and mainly agricultural landscape of the Lower Ohře Table. The Ohře River flows through the town.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first written mention of Budyně nad Ohří is from 1173. Originally there was a wooden castle, but it was rebuilt to a Gothic stone castle by King Ottokar I at the beginning of the 13th century. King John of Bohemia sold Budyně to the noble family of Zajíc of Hazmburk, who owned it until 1613. During their rule, the castle and the whole estate prospered and developed.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n== Transport ==\nBudyně nad Ohří is located on the railway from Roudnice nad Labem to Libochovice. Historic trains run on it and it is only in operation during the summer tourist season on weekends.\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\nBudyně nad Ohří is known for its water castle. Since 1946, it has been owned by the town. In the 1920s, the Janda's Museum was founded in the premises of the castle with an exposition of donations from travellers and private collections of the inhabitants of the region. The museum was reopened in 1997.\nThe Church of Saint Wenceslaus is the landmark of the town square. It was founded in the 13th century. After it was damaged by a fire in 1669, the originally Gothic church was rebuilt in the Baroque style. In 1710, the church was extended.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nBavor Rodovský mladší of Hustířany (1526–1591), nobleman and alchemist; died here\nPetr Čech (1944–2022), hurdler\n\n\n== Twin towns – sister cities ==\n\nBudyně nad Ohří is twinned with:\n\n Hohnstein, Germany\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nThe sub-province Mělník (Czech: Mělnická podoblast) is one two wine regions in Bohemia and consists of 37 official wine municipalities. The sub-province is situated on the Elbe river. Although it is named after the town of Mělník in central Bohemia, it contains wineyards located in many parts of Bohemia - in Prague, around Čáslav, Roudnice nad Labem, even in Trutnov under the Giant Mountains. Simply said, all vineyards in Bohemia, that are not part of the sub-province Litoměřice, belong to the sub-province Mělník.\n\n\n== Mělník ==\nMělník lies on the confluence of Elbe and Vltava rivers. This area has been known since the medieval for Pinot noir. This sort has been brought from Burgundy together with French wine growers.\n\n\n== Prague ==\nThe wine production was very important for Prague. The vineyards produced wine for the royal court. The wine history of Prague is still present in local names, for example, one the Prague quarters is called Vinohrady (the Czech word for vineyards). However, wine production is recently somewhat less intensive. Small vineyards have remained in Trója or Malá Strana, the wine grown there is quite exclusive and expensive. The typical sort is Müller Thurgau.\n\n\n== Other areas ==\nEspecially Roudnice nad Labem also has rich history of wineries. Vineyards may also be found around the towns of Čáslav, Kolín, Kutná Hora, Trutnov and Beroun (this only town lies southward of Prague and thus has no relation to Elbe river).\n\n\n== References ==\nThe House of Lobkowicz (Lobkovicové in modern Czech, sg. z Lobkovic; Lobkowitz in German) is an important Bohemian noble family that dates back to the 14th century and is one of the oldest noble families of the region. Over the centuries, the family expanded their possessions through marriage with the most powerful families of the region, which resulted in gaining vast territories all across central Europe. Due to that, the family was also incorporated into the German, Austrian and Belgian nobility. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe first Lobkowiczs were members of the gentry of north-eastern Bohemia in the late 14th century. On 3 August 1459 they were granted the title of Freiherr.

It was owned by the noble Lobkowitz family.\nToday, it houses the theatre museum, which is a part of the Kunsthistorisches Museum.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe palace is located on the Lobkowitzplatz, a square which previously had been called the \"pig market\", at which time it was a less distinguished address. The Lobkowitz Palace ranks among the oldest palace buildings of Vienna. The palace is the first important baroque city palace built after the Battle of Vienna (die zweite Türkenbelagerung), when the aristocracy no longer had to invest its money only for military purposes.\nThe palace façade, unlike its interior, is still to a large extent in its original condition from the time of its construction. The original building that stood where the palace now stands was sold in 1685 by Leopold Baron von Felss to the imperial Colonel stable master Philipp Sigmund count von Dietrichstein. This led to the current palace, built between 1685 and 1687 by Giovanni Pietro Tencala. The new palace occupied not only the site of the house of the Baron von Felss, but also the original site of a neighbouring bathhouse, which was also bought by Philipp Sigmund Count von Dietrichstein.\nAfter repeated ownership changes (among the owners, Count Wenzel Gallas), the palace was bought in 1745 by Ferdinand Philipp Prince von Lobkowitz.\nThe palace remained from that time up to 1980 in the possession of the Lobkowitz family.\nUnder the Lobkowitz family, the palace underwent several renovations. At the beginning of the 18th century, most notably, Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach and his son Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach were entrusted with the project.\nIn the early 19th century, Ludwig van Beethoven was often a guest in the palace, since the owner at that time, Joseph Franz Maximilian von Lobkowitz, was an important patron of the composer. Beethoven's Third Symphony was dedicated to the prince,\nwhich is why the festival room of the palace was named \"Eroica Hall\".\nIn 1804,\nBeethoven's Third Symphony was performed for the first time in Vienna in this hall, with the composer as conductor.\nDuring the Congress of Vienna, numerous celebrations and balls were held in the palace. Around the  middle of the 19th century, the Lobkowitzes transferred their major residence to their hereditary palace in Roudnice nad Labem, northern Bohemia, and released their Viennese residence for letting.\nBetween 1869 and 1909, the house was used as the French embassy.\nFrom 1919 to 1938, the Czechoslovakian legation was accommodated there.\nAfter end of the Second World War, the house was used as seat of the Institut Français de Vienne.\nIn  1980, the palace became government property, and since 1991, after a comprehensive renovation, it has served as the theatre museum of the Kunsthistorisches Museum.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLobkowicz Palace\nLobkowicz family\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nHomepage of Theatermuseum – museum group in the Palace\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\"Homepage of Theatermuseum, with gallery of the Palace\". www.theatermuseum.at (in German).

Štěpánek was also known for biting his classmates and relishing in their pain, and in the fifth grade, he is also said to have stabbed a classmate with a knife following an argument. In 1930, he was threatened with up to a year in prison for a theft, but his mother prevented it by arranging a psychiatric examination with a friend, who deduced that Štěpánek had mental issues.

In 1204 Ottokar's royal status was accepted by Otto IV as well as by Pope Innocent III. It was officially recognized in 1212 by the Golden Bull of Sicily issued by Emperor Frederick II, elevating the Duchy of Bohemia to Kingdom status and proclaiming its independence which was also later bolstered by future king of Bohemia and emperor Charles IV, with his golden bull in 1356."

For example, the word for \"horse\" used to be written kóň, which evolved, along with pronunciation, into kuoň. Ultimately, the vowel [o] disappeared completely, and the uo evolved into ů, modern form kůň. The letter ů now has the same pronunciation as the letter ú (long [uː]), but changes to a short o when a word is morphed (e.g. nom. kůň → gen. koně, nom. dům → gen. domu), thus showing the historical evolution of the language. Ů cannot occur in initial position, while ú occurs almost exclusively in initial position or at the beginning of a word root in a compound, a common example of this is the word for \"triangle\" trojúhelník. These characters are used also in Steuer's Silesian alphabet. The [uo] pronunciation has prevailed in some Moravian dialects, as well as in Slovak, which uses the letter ô instead of ů."

This led to the current palace, built between 1685 and 1687 by Giovanni Pietro Tencala. The new palace occupied not only the site of the house of the Baron von Felss, but also the original site of a neighbouring bathhouse, which was also bought by Philipp Sigmund Count von Dietrichstein.\nAfter repeated ownership changes (among the owners, Count Wenzel Gallas), the palace was bought in 1745 by Ferdinand Philipp Prince von Lobkowitz.\nThe palace remained from that time up to 1980 in the possession of the Lobkowitz family."

Set in Glasgow, Scotland, it is her debut feature film and was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival.\nThe film won its director numerous awards including the Carl Foreman Award for Newcomer in British Film at the BAFTA Awards, the Sutherland Trophy at the London Film Festival and the Silver Hugo for Best Director at the Chicago International Film Festival. Ratcatcher grossed $888,817 worldwide. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray by The Criterion Collection.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nRatcatcher is set in Glasgow in 1973. The city, despite its Victorian grandeur, has some housing schemes that are among the poorest in western Europe. Many had no running hot water, bathing facilities, and indoor toilets. The city is midway through a major re-development program, demolishing these schemes and re-housing the tenants in new modern estates. Social problems are exacerbated by the binmen going on strike creating additional health hazards and a breeding ground for rats. The main character, James, is a 12-year-old boy, growing up in one of these housing schemes that is gradually emptying as tenants are re-housed in newer developments. Meanwhile all that those that remain can do is patiently wait to be re-housed like James and his family, (two sisters, one older, one younger, his mum and heavy-drinking father).\n\n\n== Plot ==\nJames's friend Ryan Quinn is being forced to put on his gum boots to go to visit his father who is in prison. But Ryan chooses to play with James instead, and runs off while his mother is not looking. Ryan meets James at the canal and drowns during some rough-house play. James bears much of the blame for not having raised the alarm, but he believes his inaction has gone unnoticed. Ryan's family are re-housed. On leaving day, Ryan's mother gives James the pair of brown sandals she'd bought for her son on the day of his death.\nSensitive James tries to come to terms with his guilt for the death of his friend while trying to make sense of the insensitive aspects of his environment. One day he takes a bus to the end of its route on the outskirts of Glasgow. He explores a new housing estate under construction. Standing in front of a kitchen window in a half-built house, he wonders in awe at the view: an expansive field of wheat, blowing in the wind and reaching to the horizon. James climbs through the window and escapes into the blissful freedom of the field.\nJames befriends a girl, Margaret Anne, whom he tries to help after her glasses are thrown into the canal by the local gang. James and Margaret Anne become friends and find comfort in each other's company. Both find some relief, James from his home environment and Margaret Anne from the local gang's abuse. One of James' friends, Kenny, receives a pet mouse as a birthday present. After the gang throw the mouse around in the air to make him \"fly\", Kenny ties the mouse's tail to a balloon, and the film shows it floating to the moon. Then, Kenny's mouse joins a whole colony of other mice frolicking on the moon. Kenny later falls in the canal and is rescued by James' father, who briefly becomes the local hero.\nThough the British Army eventually arrive to clean all the rubbish from the neighbourhood, James realises that his situation will most likely never change. He throws himself into the canal. A brief scene is shown of James and his family moving into a new neighbourhood.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nWilliam Eadie as James Gillespie\nTommy Flanagan as George Gillespie\nMandy Matthews as Anne Gillespie\nMichelle Stewart as Ellen Gillespie\nLynne Ramsay Jr. as Anne Marie Gillespie\nLeanne Mullen as Margaret Anne\nJohn Miller as Kenny\nThomas McTaggart as Ryan Quinn\nJackie Quinn as Mrs. Quinn\nJames Ramsay as Mr. Quinn\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRatcatcher received generally positive reviews from critics.

Unlike conventional plays, Shawn initially performed The Fever not in a theater, but in private homes by appointment.  Later, he performed the piece in a theater, but in keeping with the desire to be unconventional in presentation, Shawn eschewed theatrical lighting, sets, and theater programs, and mingled with the audience immediately before the play began.  In an interview with The Paris Review, Shawn explained that he used these novel approaches to avoid people dismissing the play's message as merely \"great theater.\"\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film follows the existential crisis of an unnamed urban sophisticate (Vanessa Redgrave) who becomes aware of the nature of world politics, economic exploitation and the vapid consumerism around her. A series of events lead her to visit an unnamed third world country, representing an exotic location somewhere in Eastern Europe, where the entire economy and populace are geared towards the tourist industry. Even as she enjoys the rare taste of its products she is made starkly aware of the reality behind the façade by a journalist (Michael Moore) who, subsequently, suggests a visit to the country's war-torn neighbour in order to experience a true picture of life in the region. She does so and her life is changed forever.\nOnce back, and now acutely attuned to the world about her, she can no longer fit back into her old elitist and consumer-driven lifestyle; watching operas, discussing art and theatre with friends, shopping for \"beautiful things\" and aggrandizing her  trifling everyday struggles, all seem meaningless to her compared with her recent macro epiphany. Compared with the global struggle for existence, her life begins to feel insignificant. Having lived in the bubble her guilt-free, pleasure-filled life, she is now challenged to look beyond comfort and soon finds herself in the throes of a moral dilemma, questioning the moral consistency of her own life and the choices that have affected the lives of the poor in far corners of the globe. She feels that she cannot be truly free having apprehended this new reality, which confronts her blindness to  the harsh truths of the class struggle and her sense of entitlement, which had, in the past, been broken, only occasionally, by displays of sympathy.\nShe returns to the war-torn nation to explore her feelings further, this new reality now drawing her ever-deeper. This leads to a delirious bout of fever in a run-down hotel where her inner-self challenges her need for comfort and entitlement, culminating in a moment of spiritual awakening and a perceived 'oneness' with all reality. Finally she sees the truth about her own life and her innate connection with every human being, apprehending the transient nature of her material life. She can no longer sit, immersed in her personal comforts and vanity, or \"clean sheets\" as she terms it, and pretend it’s all right when the world around her is filled with strife and exploitation for millions of people. She is lustrated of her previous immunity towards their predicament and is, by extension, finally able to see the truth of own life, as summarised by film's tag-line: Enlightenment Can Be Brutal.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nVanessa Redgrave - Woman\nAngelina Jolie - Revolutionary\nMichael Moore - Reporter\nJoely Richardson - Woman at 30\n\n\n== Production ==\nParts of the film was shot in Snowdonia and Penmon, Anglesey in North Wales to represent locations in Eastern Europe\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2005: Bratislava International Film Festival:\nBoxes (French: Les Boites) is a 2007 French film and the directorial debut of Jane Birkin. Birkin also stars alongside Geraldine Chaplin and Michel Piccoli. The film is based on  Birkin's own family life, chronicling three marriages and the three children she bore from these marriages. The title alludes to the way in which she compartmentalises  these relationships and stages of her life. The film was nominated for the Grand Prix at the Bratislava International Film Festival. The film premiered in the Un Certain Regard portion of the 2007 Cannes Film Festival on 21 May. It was released in France on 6 June 2007.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn Brittany, a middle-aged woman, Anna lives in a rambling home with her sometime dead father (Piccoli), her opinionated mother (Chaplin) and the memories of her three grown-up daughters. As Anna struggles with her mid-life crisis, the possessions and photographs in the home begin to spark her memories of childhood and earlier adulthood.\nIn particular the memories evoked are of her three husbands and the children she bore with them. Her first marriage to Fanny's English father (Hurt) failed and as a consequence, Fanny (Régnier) barely knows him. Fanny's half-sister is Camille (Doillon), who Anna had with Camille's now dead father, Max (Benichou). There is also her third husband, Jean (Karyo), with whom she had Lilly (Exarchopoulos), but he left to pursue affairs.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nGeraldine Chaplin as Mother\nMichel Piccoli as Father\nJane Birkin as Anna\nNatacha Régnier as Fanny\nLou Doillon as Camille\nJohn Hurt as Fanny's father\nMaurice Bénichou as Max\nTchéky Karyo as Jean\nAdèle Exarchopoulos as Lilli\nAnnie Girardot as Joséphine\n\n\n== Production ==\nBirkin wrote the script for Boxes in 1995, shortly after her father's death. The film was shot in Birkin's own family home in Landéda. Birkin offered the main role of Anna to Chaplin, but Chaplin turned this down, feeling that as the role was written for a 45-year-old woman, she would be better suited to the role of Anna's mother.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nLe Figaro praised the \"worrying, unpredictable and touching sincerity\" of the film. Michèle Levieux of L'Humanité said that the film was so well written, it deserved to be adapted for the stage.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBoxes at IMDb\nThe following is a list of awards and nominations received by actress Vanessa Redgrave.

When he does not arrive, Tanya panics and claims political asylum, resulting in her and her son being confined to the small seaside town of Stonehaven while their claim is considered, a process she is told could take up to a year. Stonehaven, a former resort town, has been converted into a ''designated holding area'' for undocumented immigrants. Tanya and Artyom are placed in a shabby apartment building that overlooks an abandoned amusement park. The area is patrolled by officers who make sure that refugees don't escape. Tanya, who illustrated children's books in Russia, carries a framed illustration she made amongst her belongings.\nTanya is propositioned by Les, an Internet pornographer, to participate in webcam porn videos. Though Tanya is initially wary of the idea, she decides to take up Les' offer when she is desperate for money. As she dresses up in one of the costumes Les gives her and crawls onto the bed, she starts crying and cannot follow through with the video, ultimately leaving. She finds other ways of making money, such as donating blood. Using the holding area's one operating payphone, she is finally able to make contact with Mark, but he breaks up with her.\nTanya attempts to withdraw her claim for asylum and tells the council officers she wants to go back to Russia, but she is told the review of her petition could still take months.

Artyom bonds with Alfie and the two repaint the drab flat he shares with his mother. Though Tanya does not want to get her heart broken again, she enters into a relationship with Alfie. Alfie reveals how he came to end up in Stonehaven; after doing prison time for a fight he got into, he felt he had nothing else to go back to, saying the town is full of \"fuckups\" like him. Tanya gets choked up when she admits that she's been married and divorced twice previously, crying that it is bad for her and Artyom, but Alfie comforts her. Artyom soon falls in with a group of tough kids who drink, smoke, and engage in petty theft. One day, Les goes to see Tanya at her flat and pays her for the first video attempt, promising more money if she returns and completes the video. Alfie hears through the door and inquires about what business Les is seeking with Tanya, but she denies any involvement.\nLater, Alfie angrily walks into Les' home and interrupts a webcam video he is filming, destroying his camera and the furniture. Alfie comes to get Tanya and Artyom, saying he is going to get them out of Stonehaven. The three of them hide in a small, abandoned sailboat on the beach; when the water rises, they sail away and manage to evade the security guards. Alfie, as well as Artyom, want Tanya to stay in England, but she reasons she has to go back to start a new life. Alfie finds a truck for Tanya and Artyom that will take them to the airport. After embracing, Tanya and Alfie say they'll remember each other.

The film follows a preteen girl living in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime who disguises herself as a boy, Osama, to support her family. It was the first film to be shot entirely in Afghanistan since 1996, when the Taliban regime banned the creation of all films. As of 2018, the film was the highest-grossing Afghan film of all time. The film is an international co-production between companies in Afghanistan, the Netherlands, Japan, Ireland, and Iran.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nAlthough the title of the film highlights an allegorical relevance to Osama bin Laden, there is no further similarity. The film takes place during the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, which is especially repressive for women.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\nIn Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, women must wear all-enveloping burqas to cover themselves and are banned from working outside the home. This causes difficulty for a family consisting of only an unnamed young girl, her mother, and her grandmother, whose male relatives have been killed in battle during the Soviet invasion and subsequent civil wars. The mother loses her hospital job when the Taliban cuts off funding, and cannot find other work.\nDesperate, the mother and grandmother decide to have the young girl disguise herself as a boy so that she can get a job. To persuade the girl to accept the plan, the grandmother tells her an Afghan fable about a boy who became a girl when he went under a rainbow. The girl reluctantly agrees, despite being afraid that the Taliban will kill her if they discover her masquerade. They cut her hair, and the girl plants a lock of it in a flowerpot. The only other people who know of the ruse are the milk vendor, who gives her a job because he was a friend of her deceased father, and a local boy named Espandi who sees through her disguise. It is Espandi who renames the girl Osama.\nThe masquerade becomes more difficult when the Taliban draft all the local boys into their madrasa, a religious and military training school for boys. They are taught how to fight and conduct ghusl, ritual ablutions, including one for when they experience a nocturnal emission or, when they are older, have sex with their wives. Osama attempts to avoid joining the ablution session, and the schoolmaster grows suspicious of her. She realises that she will inevitably be found out. Several of the boys begin to pick on her. Espandi is able to protect her at first, but her secret is discovered when she begins to menstruate.\nOsama is arrested and put on trial along with two other people. The others are condemned and put to death, but as Osama is destitute and helpless, her life is spared; she is instead given in marriage to a much older man. He already has three wives, all of whom hate him and say he has destroyed their lives. The wives take pity on Osama, but are powerless to help her. The husband shows her the padlocks he uses on his wives' rooms, reserving the largest for her. The film ends with the new husband leading Osama to a room, then him conducting an ablution in an outdoor bath, which the boys were earlier taught to conduct after ejaculation.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nMarina Golbahari – Osama\nArif Herati – Espandi\nZubaida Sahar – Mom\nMalik Akhlaqi – Sun osama\nGol Rahman Ghorbandi – Lady No. 1\nMohamad Haref Harat – Lady No. 2\nMohamad Nader Khadjeh – Lady No. 3\nKhwaja Nader – Jadi\nHamida Refah – Rohmi\n\n\n== Production ==\nSiddiq Barmak's inspiration was found in a news story he read while in Peshawar, Pakistan. The paper told the story of a girl who had dressed as a boy to attend school but was eventually discovered by the Taliban. Barmak would go on to add elements of other stories that were shared with him by people who had lived in Afghanistan under Taliban rule culminating with the story of the film.\nThe film was shot on location in Kabul. Work began in June 2002 and was completed in March 2003 with a budget of approximately $46,000.

Social problems are exacerbated by the binmen going on strike creating additional health hazards and a breeding ground for rats. The main character, James, is a 12-year-old boy, growing up in one of these housing schemes that is gradually emptying as tenants are re-housed in newer developments.

Vanessa Redgrave said in a 2016 interview with The Times, \"It's no surprise that Carlo has ended up in the film business; he just happens to prefer being on the other side of the camera.\""
