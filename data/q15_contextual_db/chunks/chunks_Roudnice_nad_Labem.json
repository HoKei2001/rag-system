        "content": "Roudnice nad Labem (Czech pronunciation: [ˈroudɲɪtsɛ ˈnad labɛm]; German: Raudnitz an der Elbe) is a town in Litoměřice District in the Ústí nad Labem Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 13,000 inhabitants. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.\nA steel road bridge dating from the early 20th century spans the Elbe in Roudnice nad Labem. Its medieval predecessor was the third oldest stone bridge in Bohemia (after Prague and Písek) and the first bridge to connect both banks of the river. Roudnice nad Labem features a castle of late Romanesque origin, now reconstructed in Baroque style.\n\n\n== Administrative parts ==\nThe village of Podlusky is an administrative part of Roudnice nad Labem.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe initial names Rúdnik and Rúdnica probably come from the iron water of a nearby spring (ruda = 'ore').\n\n\n== Geography ==\nRoudnice nad Labem is located about 15 kilometres (9 mi) southeast of Litoměřice and 37 km (23 mi) north of Prague. It lies in the Lower Ohře Table, in the Polabí lowlands. The highest point is on the hill Hostěraz at 265 m (869 ft) above sea level. The town is situated on the left bank of the Elbe River, which forms the northern municipal border.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nRoudnice nad Labem is one of the oldest Czech towns. The first written mentions of Roudnice are from 1167 and 1176, but archeological excavations in the area confirm existence of a prehistoric settlement. The market settlement quickly became economically important due to its location on the Lusatian road, and in the 13th century, it received town status.\nIn the 12th century, a Romanesque castle was built, used as the summer residence of archbishops and bishops.\nIn 1333, Bishop Jan IV of Dražice ordered that a bridge be built over the Elbe. It was the first stone bridge over the Elbe and the third stone bridge in Bohemia. \nAt the end of the 14th century, the New Town of Roudnice nad Labem (encompassing today's Jan of Dražice Square and Hus Square) was built and, along with the Old Town of Roudnice nad Labem, surrounded by walls. In 1421, during the Hussite Wars, Roudnice nad Labem was conquered by Jan Žižka. During the Hussite invasions, the local monastery was destroyed and would never be rebuilt. After the Hussite Wars, the town was sold several times, which did not benefit its development. In 1603, it was acquired by the Lobkowicz family and it remained under their control until 1945. During their rule, the town was rebuilt and expanded. During the Thirty Years' War, Roudnice nad Labem was burned down and demolished by the Swedish army.\nIn the 19th century, Roudnice nad Labem became the industrial and economical centre of the Podřipský region, due to several new factories and the railway from Prague to Dresden. Until 1918, the town was part of Austria-Hungary, in the district of the same name, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Bohemia.\nThe first football match in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and in the Czech lands took place on the islet in the middle of the Elbe, located within the town limits, in 1887 (in 1892, according to some sources). In 1910, the old stone bridge was rebuilt into a new steel road bridge.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n== Transport ==\nThe D8 motorway from Prague to Ústí nad Labem runs along the western municipal border.\nRoudnice nad Labem is located on the intraregional railway line Prague–Děčín. It is also the starting point of a local line to Bříza with four stops within the town.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThere are four high schools in Roudnice nad Labem: Gymnasium Roudnice nad Labem, Vocational School and Training Centre, Podřipská Private Vocational School and Training Centre, and Higher Vocational School and Secondary Vocational School, which also offers higher education. There are also five primary schools, including one special school, and a primary art school.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nThe town has a swimming pool, an ice hockey arena, and football and athletic stadiums. Rou\nÚstí nad Labem Region or Ústecký Region (Czech: Ústecký kraj) is an administrative unit (kraj) of the Czech Republic, located in the north-western part of the historical land of Bohemia, and named after the capital, Ústí nad Labem. It covers the majority of the former North Bohemia province (Czech: Severočeský kraj) and is part of the broader area of North Bohemia.\nThe region borders the regions of Liberec (east), Central Bohemia (south), Plzeň (southwest), Karlovy Vary (west) and the German region of Saxony to the north.\nThe Ústí nad Labem Region comprises a range of very different types of landscape. Between the high escarpment of the Ore Mountains range and the Bohemian Central Uplands with many volcanic hills, there are vast areas devastated by surface coal mining (the Most Basin), partly being recultivated into an artificial landscape with ponds, plains and groves. The Elbe river runs through the Central Uplands in a winding gorge of the Porta Bohemica. The southern part of the region, Polabí, is flat and fertile, while in the northeast are the sandstone formations of Bohemian Switzerland, including the monumental Pravčická brána, a natural sandstone arch.\nThe geographical location of the area, between Prague and Germany, has been a significant factor in the region's development.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe Ústí nad Labem Region is divided into 7 districts:\n\nThe districts are further subdivided into 16 administrative district of municipalities with extended competence.\n\n\n== Population ==\nAs of 1 January 2019, the region had 820,789 inhabitants, the fifth most populous in the Czech Republic. The population density is higher than the national average, and the region is the fourth most densely populated in the country. The most densely populated areas of the region are the areas on the brown coal basin while areas with a lower population density are the Ore Mountains and the Louny District and Litoměřice District, which predominantly contain smaller country settlements. The largest municipality is Ústí nad Labem, the region's seat, with 92,952 inhabitants.\nThe Ústí nad Labem region has the third youngest population; the average age is 42.0 years. The Ústí nad Labem Region ranks second-highest in the Czech Republic in the number of live births per 1,000 inhabitants, alongside the Liberec Region (11.5), but also has one of the highest mortality rates (10.6 deaths per 1,000 inhabitants). The Ústí nad Labem Region ranks second nationally in the number of divorces per 1,000 inhabitants (3.4) and first in the number of abortions per 100 live births (47.5).\nThe region has 46 cities and towns, in which 80.7% of its inhabitants reside, and 354 villages. 54% of the region's villages have a population greater than 500, but only 5.8% of the region's inhabitants live there.\nThe composition of the population according to nationality is:\n\nCzech: 92.12%\nSlovak: 2.71%\nGerman: 1.25%\nRomani: 0.23%\nPolish: 0.2%\nMoravian: 0.13%\nOther: 3.45%\n\n\n=== Cities and towns ===\nThe table shows cities and towns in the region that had more than 10,000 inhabitants (as of 1 January 2024).

The region's geography is very diverse.\nThe area along the German borders is dominated by the Ore Mountains, the Elbe Sandstone Mountains and the Lusatian Mountains. The Ore Mountains are very old and formed of volcanic rocks or Palaeozoic schist.\nIn contrast, the south-eastern part of the region is formed by the plains that originate from Mesozoic era (Czech Cretaceous Formation, Czech: Česká křídová tabule).

The territory extends into three geomorphological mesoregions: Lower Ohře Table (south), Central Bohemian Uplands (north) and Ralsko Uplands (east). The highest point of the district is the mountain Milešovka in Velemín with an elevation of 837 m (2,746 ft), the lowest point is the river bed of the Elbe in Prackovice nad Labem at 143 m (469 ft). A dominant feature of the southern part of the district is the Říp Mountain.\nFrom the total district area of 1,032.4 km2 (398.6 sq mi), agricultural land occupies 731.5 km2 (282.4 sq mi), forests occupy 170.2 km2 (65.7 sq mi), and water area occupies 18.8 km2 (7.3 sq mi). Forests cover 16.5% of the district's area.\nThe most important rivers are the Elbe and its tributary Ohře, which drain the entire territory. The largest body of water is Žernosecké Lake, an artificial lake created by flooding sandstone quarry. However, there are only a few bodies of water.\nČeské Středohoří is a protected landscape area that extends into the district.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Most populated municipalities ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe largest employers with headquarters in Litoměřice District and at least 500 employees are:\n\n\n== Transport ==\nThe D8 motorway from Prague to Ústí nad Labem runs across the district.\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\nThe most important monuments in the district, protected as national cultural monuments, are:\n\nŘíp with the Rotunda of Saint George\nSmall Fortress in Terezín\nLibochovice Castle\nPloskovice Castle\nAugustinian monastery in Roudnice nad Labem\nLitoměřice Town Hall\nThe best-preserved settlements, protected as monument reservations and monument zones, are:\n\nThe most visited tourist destination is the Terezín Memorial.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nLitoměřice District – profile on the Czech Statistical Office website\nSvatoslav Štěpánek (25 December 1911 – 8 November 1938), known as The Roudnice Monster, was a Czechoslovak serial killer who killed at least one child and two women around Roudnice nad Labem between 1926 and 1936. Convicted of these crimes and two attempted murders, he was sentenced to death and subsequently executed in 1938.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nSvatoslav Štěpánek was born on 25 December 1911, in Roudnice nad Labem, the youngest of four children. He came from a respected family – his father was a chemist in a sugar factory and his mother a retired kindergarten teacher. Svatoslav, who suffered from meningitis soon after his premature birth and was physically weak, was doted upon by his mother. His father died when he was still young, prompting his mother to move him and his three siblings to the Slovakian part of the country, where they remained for some time. After returning to Roudnice nad Labem, Štěpánek studied to become a gardener but never took any work.\nIn contrast to his siblings, Svatoslav was despised by other residents of his neighbourhood due to his odd and disconcerting behaviour: besides stealing items such as women's underwear, he also enjoyed dissecting frogs, liked to torture and kill animals, and visited the local cemetery to watch the gravedigger work. Štěpánek was also known for biting his classmates and relishing in their pain, and in the fifth grade, he is also said to have stabbed a classmate with a knife following an argument. In 1930, he was threatened with up to a year in prison for a theft, but his mother prevented it by arranging a psychiatric examination with a friend, who deduced that Štěpánek had mental issues. After the exam, the man also told his mother that the teenager had serious psychological issues and should seek immediate treatment, but Štěpánek's mother dismissed his advice.\n\n\n== First murder ==\nŠtěpánek's first known murder took place in 1926 when he was still 16. On one occasion when he was left to watch over his sister, Štěpánek was visited by 5-year-old Bedřich Brožovský, the son of a couple who shared a rented apartment with him. It's unclear what exactly occurred on the day of the murder, but according to Štěpánek, he had become annoyed with Brožovský, luring him to the cellar where he hit him on the head with a hammer multiple times. In order to dispose of the body, he dismembered it and buried it in his garden. He would later be questioned about Brožovský's mysterious disappearance but claimed to know nothing of it. After some time, the local townsfolk and police alike came to the conclusion that little Bedřich had likely been kidnapped by a gang of gypsies, and with no leads, the case went cold.\n\n\n== New crimes ==\n\n\n=== Attempted murders ===\nAfter an apparent 10-year lull, when he is not known to have committed any crimes, Štěpánek resumed his violent activities on 10 January 1936. On that day, while riding his bicycle around Roudnice nad Labem, he spotted 13-year-old Růžena Jebavá walking home from school. Štěpánek rode up to her, drew out his pistol and shot her in the left shoulder blade, narrowly missing her heart. With Jebavá left writhing on the ground, he rode a little further before suddenly returning, telling her \"Here you go\", and leaving again. She was found by passers-by and rushed to the hospital, where an early intervention by doctors saved her life.\nThirteen days later, 26-year-old Zdeňka Drobná came across Štěpánek, who was repairing his bicycle on the road, while en route home from visiting her husband in the hospital. When she went past him, Štěpánek went after her and knocked her into a nearby ditch, whereupon he began swearing at and threatening her. Drobná got up and tried to run away, but Štěpánek caught up with her again and aimed his pistol directly at her heart. She instinctively slapped his hand, causing him to fire a shot into her stomach. Despite successfully injuring his victim and about to finish her off with an axe, a passing witness scared off Ště\nHigh-speed rail in the Czech Republic is being planned with construction starting in 2026 and maximum speed between 200 and 320 km/h. Although České Dráhy owns and operates multiple rolling stock capable of speeds of 230 km/h (143 mph) since 2004, there is, as of 2023, no infrastructure capable of velocity over 200 km/h (124 mph). The only exception is the 13.3-kilometre long track at Velim railway test circuit with a maximum allowed speed of 230 km/h (143 mph) for tilting trains and up to 210 km/h (130 mph) for conventional trains. Czech rolling stock manufacturer Škoda Transportation has produced high-speed rolling stock since the 1970s.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\nThe basis for Czech high-speed rail was laid down in 2017 when the Government approved the High-Speed Rail Development Program. According to this program, the following routes, referred to as \"RS\", (standing for rychlá spojení, fast connections) will be developed:\n\nRS1: Prague–Brno–Ostrava–(Katowice)\nRS2: Brno–Břeclav–(Vienna/Bratislava)\nRS3: Prague–Plzeň–(Munich)\nRS4: Prague–Ústí nad Labem–(Dresden)\nRS5: Prague–Liberec/Hradec Králové–(Wrocław)\nThe development will include the construction of new lines as well as upgrade existing lines to 200 km/h (124 mph). New high-speed routes will consist of the following shorter sections:\n\n\n=== Pilot projects ===\nIn 2018 SŽDC identified following three shorter sections as pilot projects:\n\nVRT Polabí (HST Polabí) – Prague – Poříčany (30 km) – part of future RS1 and RS5\nVRT Jižní Morava (HST South Moravia) – Brno – Vranovice – part of future RS2\nVRT Moravská brána (HST Moravian Gate) – Přerov – Ostrava – part of future RS1\n\n\n=== Train stations planning ===\nAlong the high-speed route RS1 (Prague-Brno-Ostrava), several new train stations are planned. Just south to the D11 motorway in the town of Nehvizdy in the Prague-East District, the new Prague East Terminal (Terminál Praha východ) is being planned. This station will be a transport hub as a part of the RS1 and RS5 (Prague-Liberec/Hradec Králové) routes and will mainly serve residents of the northeastern part of the Central Bohemian Region. Along RS1, the high-speed line will be connected via a branch line to the train station of Světlá nad Sázavou, which will be reconstructed.\nClose to highway exit 112 on the D1 motorway in the Jihlava District, a new Jihlava train station (terminál Jihlava VRT) is planned as part of RS1. This station will also be connected to the regional railway between Jihlava and Havlíčkův Brod and serve as a transport hub for the Vysočina Region. Another new station to the west of Velká Bíteš is planned on a branch line from the RS1 towards the regional railway between Havlíčkův Brod and Brno.\nIn the south of Brno, the new train station Brno-Vídeňská is planned to serve the region around Brno and to prevent unnecessary traffic to Brno main railway station in the city centre.\nOne new train station is planned along the high-speed route RS4 (Prague – Ústí nad Labem). This new train station (Terminál Roudnice nad Labem VRT) will be constructed to the west of Roudnice nad Labem and will serve as a transfer hub in the Litoměřice District.\nSŽ is also considering upgrading of some ETCS-equipped 160 km/h (99 mph) tracks to 200 km/h (124 mph) and also upgrading some current 160 km/h (99 mph) projects to 200 km/h (124 mph). In 2020 SŽ called for bids to upgrade ongoing 9 km (6 mi) Soběslav – Doubí project and 20 km (12 mi) Sudoměřice – Votice project to 200 km/h (124 mph), both projects are on Prague – České Budějovice route.\n\n\n== Rolling stock operated in the Czech Republic ==\n\nSince 2004 České dráhy have been operating seven ČD Class 680 sets. These Pendolino-based trains are capable of operating at 230 km/h (143 mph) and were intended for operation on the Berlin – Prague – Vienna route. While testing from Břeclav to Brno on 18 November 2004, the ČD Class 680 reached a speed of 237 km/h (147 mph) and created a new Czech railway speed record.

It was the predecessor state of the modern Czech Republic.\nThe Kingdom of Bohemia was an Imperial State in the Holy Roman Empire. The Bohemian king was a prince-elector of the empire. The kings of Bohemia, besides the region of Bohemia itself, also ruled other lands belonging to the Bohemian Crown, which at various times included Moravia, Silesia, Lusatia, and parts of Saxony, Brandenburg, and Bavaria.\nThe kingdom was established by the Přemyslid dynasty in the 12th century by the Duchy of Bohemia, later ruled by the House of Luxembourg, the Jagiellonian dynasty, and from 1526 the House of Habsburg and its successor, the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. Numerous kings of Bohemia were also elected Holy Roman Emperors, and the capital, Prague, was the imperial seat in the late 14th century, and again at the end of the 16th and the beginning of the 17th centuries.\nShortly before the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the kingdom became part of the newly proclaimed Habsburg Austrian Empire, and subsequently the Austro-Hungarian Empire from 1867. Bohemia retained its name and formal status as a separate Kingdom of Bohemia until 1918, known as a crown land within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and its capital Prague was one of the empire's leading cities. The Czech language (called the Bohemian language in English usage until the 19th century) was the main language of the Diet and the nobility until 1627 (after the Bohemian Revolt was suppressed). German was then formally made equal with Czech and eventually prevailed as the language of the Diet until the Czech National Revival in the 19th century. German was also widely used as the language of administration in many towns after the Germans immigrated and populated some areas of the country in the 13th century. The royal court used the Czech, Latin, and German languages, depending on the ruler and period.\nFollowing the defeat of the Central Powers in World War I, both the Kingdom and Empire were dissolved. Bohemia became the core part of the newly formed Czechoslovak Republic.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 13th century (growth) ===\nAlthough some former rulers of Bohemia had enjoyed a non-hereditary royal title during the 11th and 12th centuries (Vratislaus II, Vladislaus II), the kingdom was formally established in 1198 by Přemysl Ottokar I, who had his status acknowledged by Philip of Swabia, elected King of the Romans, in return for his support against the rival Emperor Otto IV. In 1204 Ottokar's royal status was accepted by Otto IV as well as by Pope Innocent III. It was officially recognized in 1212 by the Golden Bull of Sicily issued by Emperor Frederick II, elevating the Duchy of Bohemia to Kingdom status and proclaiming its independence which was also later bolstered by future king of Bohemia and emperor Charles IV, with his golden bull in 1356.\nUnder these terms, the Czech king was to be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in the imperial councils. The imperial prerogative to ratify each Bohemian ruler and to appoint the bishop of Prague was revoked. The king's successor was his son Wenceslaus I, from his second marriage.\n\nWenceslaus I's sister Agnes, later canonized, refused to marry the Holy Roman Emperor and instead devoted her life to spiritual works. Corresponding with the Pope, she established the Knights of the Cross with the Red Star in 1233, the first military order in the Kingdom of Bohemia. Four other military orders were present in Bohemia: the Order of St. John of Jerusalem from c. 1160; the Order of Saint Lazarus from the late 12th century; the Teutonic Order from c. 1200–1421; and the Knights Templar from 1232 to 1312.\n\nThe 13th century was the most dynamic period of the Přemyslid reign over Bohemia.

She started gymnastics at the age of four and was coached by her parents in Zlín. Her younger sister, Aneta, also competed in gymnastics, while her older sister, Lucie, was a leading Czech long jumper.\n\n\n== Gymnastics career ==\nAt the age of 10, Komrsková became a member of the Czech national junior team, and in 1995, she participated in the European Junior Championships for the first time. Two years later, she won three titles in the senior national championships in 1997, including the all-around title, with particularly strong performances on the uneven bars and vault.\n\n\n=== 1999–2000 ===\nAt the 1999 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Tianjin, Komrsková qualified to the all-around final in ninth place, but major faults on beam sent her back to 33rd in the all-around final. The Czech team finished in 16th place, qualifying two gymnasts to the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.\nIn the Olympic year, Komrsková recorded her first success in a World Cup competition (second place on vault in Cottbus, behind Russia's Yelena Produnova) and finished ninth in the all-around at the 2000 European Championships.\nShe and Kateřina Marešová competed for the Czech Republic at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Komrsková qualified for the individual all-around final in 29th place despite an infection contracted through blisters on her forearm. Immediately after the final, she underwent minor surgery.\nAfter the Games, Komrsková placed fourth on uneven bars and vault at the World Cup final in Glasgow.\n\n\n=== 2001–2004 ===\nFollowing several podium finishes in World Cup events, Komrsková was one of the favorites for the vault title at the 2001 World Championships in Ghent. She advanced to the final and finished fourth behind Svetlana Khorkina, Oksana Chusovitina, and Andreea Răducan, losing the bronze medal to Răducan by 0.037 points.\nKomrsková was the stand-by for the uneven bars final at the 2002 European Championships and the vault final at the 2003 World Championships, missing the former by 0.012. Her 11th-place finish in the all-around at the 2002 European Championships was her top result in those two years. At the 2003 Worlds in Anaheim, California, she clinched the only Czech berth for the 2004 Summer Olympics, but injured her elbow in the process. At the end of the year, she also broke bones in her foot. She missed the 2004 national and European championships but recovered in time for the Olympics in Athens.\nAt the Olympics, Komrsková finished 32nd in the all-around qualification and was the second alternate for the final. She said afterward: \"When I was in the Olympic Games before, I was younger and I was a bit overwhelmed. Now, it's a normal competition for me. I still think the Olympics is the most important competition for an athlete, but now I am a lot more relaxed about it.\"\n\n\n=== 2005–2008 ===\nAfter the 2004 Olympics, Komrsková decided to end her gymnastics career and try pole vaulting, following the example of Daniela Bártová, a former Czech gymnast who went on to set pole vaulting records. However, Komrsková was hindered by her elbow injury. She then tried to join her sister Lucie in long jumping, but ultimately decided to return to gymnastics.\nHer parents had retired from coaching, so Komrsková began training with the Czech national team coach, Stanislav Vyzina, in Brno. She returned to national competitions in late 2005 and went on to win her first World Cup title: a gold medal on vault at the B-category World Cup in Maribor, Slovenia. In 2006, she performed well at several World Cup events, winning gold on vault and bronze on balance beam in Maribor, and silver on vault in Moscow and Lyon.\nAt the 2006 European Championships in Volos, Gr\nThe Elbe (German: [ˈɛlbə] ; Czech: Labe [ˈlabɛ] ; Low German: Ilv or Elv; Upper and Lower Sorbian: Łobjo, pronounced [ˈwɔbʲɔ]) is one of the major rivers of Central Europe. It rises in the Giant Mountains of the northern Czech Republic before traversing much of Bohemia (western half of the Czech Republic), then Germany and flowing into the North Sea at Cuxhaven, 110 kilometres (68 miles) northwest of Hamburg. Its total length is 1,094 km (680 mi).\nThe Elbe's major tributaries include the rivers Vltava, Saale, Havel, Mulde, Schwarze Elster, and Ohře.\nThe Elbe river basin, comprising the Elbe and its tributaries, has a catchment area of 148,268 square kilometres (57,247 sq mi), the twelfth largest in Europe. The basin spans four countries; however, it lies almost entirely just in two of them, Germany (65.5%) and the Czech Republic (33.7%, covering about two thirds of the nation's territory). On its southeastern edges, the Elbe river basin also comprises small parts of Austria (0.6%) and Poland (0.2%). The Elbe catchment area is inhabited by 24.4 million people; its biggest cities are Berlin, Hamburg, Prague, Dresden and Leipzig.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n \nFirst attested in Latin as Albis, the name Elbe means \"river\" or \"river-bed\" and is nothing more than the High German version of a word (*albī) found elsewhere in Germanic; cf. Old Norse river name Elfr, Swedish älv \"river\", Norwegian elv \"river\", Old English river name elf, and Middle Low German elve \"river-bed\".\n\n\n== Course ==\n\n\n=== In the Czech Republic ===\nThe Elbe (Labe) rises on the slopes of Mt. Violík at an elevation of 1,386 metres (4,547 ft) in the Giant Mountains on the northwest borders of the Czech Republic. Of the numerous small streams whose waters compose the infant river. After plunging down the 30 metres (98 ft) of the Elbe Falls, the latter stream unites with the steeply torrential Bílé Labe, and thereafter the united stream of the Elbe pursues a southerly course, emerging from the mountain glens at Jaroměř, where it receives Úpa and Metuje.\nHere the Elbe enters the vast vale named Polabí (meaning \"land along the Elbe\"), and continues on southwards through Hradec Králové (where Orlice flows in) and then to Pardubice, where it turns sharply to the west. At Kolín some 43 kilometres (27 mi) further on, it bends gradually towards the north-west. At the village of Káraný, a little above Brandýs nad Labem, the Jizera enters in.\nAt Mělník its stream is more than doubled in volume by the Vltava, a major river which winds northwards through Bohemia. Upstream from the confluence the Vltava is in fact much longer (434 kilometres (270 mi) against 294 kilometres (183 mi) of the Elbe so far), and has a greater discharge and a larger drainage basin. Nonetheless, for historical reasons the river retains the name Elbe, also because at the confluence point it is the Elbe that flows through the main, wider valley while the Vltava flows into the valley to meet the Elbe at almost a right angle, and thus appears to be the tributary river.\nSome distance lower down, at Litoměřice, the waters of the Elbe are tinted by the reddish Ohře. Thus augmented, and swollen into a stream 140 metres (460 ft) wide, the Elbe carves a path through the basaltic mass of the České Středohoří, churning its way through a picturesque, deep, narrow and curved rocky gorge.\n\n\n=== In Germany ===\nShortly after crossing the Czech-German frontier, and passing through the sandstone defiles of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains, the stream assumes a north-westerly direction, which on the whole it preserves right to the North Sea.\nThe river rolls through Dresden and finally, beyond Meissen, enters on its long journey across the North German Plain passing along the former western border of East Germany, touching Torgau, Wittenberg, Dessau, Magdeburg, Wittenberge, and Hamburg on the way, and taking on the waters of the Mulde and Saale from the west, and those of the Schwarze Elster, Havel and Elde from the east.

Liga.\nThroughout his career, he played 45 matches for Czechoslovakia as a forward between 1970 and 1983, scoring 11 goals. He was a participant in the 1982 FIFA World Cup.\nHe played for FK Teplice and later spent his best football years at Bohemians Praha.\nBičovský later began a coaching career with ASK Ybbs, FK Teplice, FC Chomutov, Lokomotíva Česká Lípa, SK Buldoci Karlovy Vary-Dvory, SIAD Braňany, FK SIAD Most, Chmel Blšany, MFK Ružomberok, SK Roudnice nad Labem and FC Zenit Čáslav.\n\n\n== References ==\nThe Roudnice Altarpiece is a three-part winged altar from the provost's church in Roudnice nad Labem, one of the oldest completely preserved Gothic retables from the period around 1410-1420. It is on display in the permanent exhibition of the National Gallery in Prague.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Roudnice triptych with the Death of the Virgin Mary was probably intended for the monastery church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary of the Augustinian Canons in Roudnice nad Labem. It survived the sack of the monastery by Jan Žižka's army in 1421. However, it is also possible that it was made in Prague for an educated burgher and did not reach Roudnice until after the Hussite Wars. It was found in the Roudnice church in the form of separately hanging panels and was first mentioned in the 19th century by J. E. Wocel. In 1928 it was purchased for the Picture Gallery of the Society of Patriotic Friends of Art and restored for exhibition purposes.\nKarel Chytil (1906) has determined the panels as parts of one altarpiece. He also identified the king kneeling at the feet of the Virgin Mary with Wenceslaus IV and dated the painting to the last decade of the 14th century.\nThe modern detailed technological research shows that the altar was created before the outbreak of the Hussite Wars and is thus probably the oldest completely preserved Czech wing altar after the altar from Mühlhausen and the small altarpiece - the so-called Cibulka triptych.\n\n\n== Description and classification ==\nThe three parts of the altar are painted in tempera on a chalk ground, on lime wood panels. The central panel is covered with linen, the outer wings with a chalk ground on wood, the framing is non-original. The central panel measures 147 x 118.5 cm, the wings of the same height are 45 cm wide (with the original frame surviving to the 19th century they were 75 cm wide). The underdrawing is both brush and engraved; linseed oil was also used as a binder for the coloured glazes.\nThe central scene with the Death of the Virgin Mary is an example of the so-called Good Death, and the composition later spread from Bohemia to neighbouring countries. It depicts Mary kneeling on her bed during her last prayer, accompanied by the Apostles, led by St. Peter. In front is a group of three kneeling apostles with a book. The richly decorated bedspread with a brocade pattern on a gilded ground links the work to the Nuremberg painting. The background is gilded, with Gothic architecture in the upper part.\nOn the left wing is the Madonna Protectress with a crown on her head and an open blue protective cloak, under which groups of four supplicants kneel on each side. In the foreground on the left is the Pope with a tiara, on the right the King with a crown in period dress (probably Wenceslaus IV) and behind them representatives of various estates. It is clear that the commissioner came from a Catholic (not Reformed) background.\nThe right wing depicts the Sorrowful Christ with exposed wounds, also with a protective cloak, under which eight supplicants are hiding. In the foreground a young bishop in a pluvial and mitre kneels on the right, and on the left a young canon wearing an alb that resembles a Premonstratensian or Augustinian habit. The motif of Christ the Protector is quite unique and, apart from one illumination and one mural in South Tyrol, has no iconographic equivalent.\nThe back of the wings depict Sorrowful Christ with a loincloth and the insignia of the Passion, and the Sorrowful Virgin Mary with a white veil on her head. At the bottom of both paintings are kneeling figures of unknown donors - on the right a burgher with four sons, on the left his wife with four daughters. The paintings on the back of the altar are probably the work of a younger assistant. They are characterised by a more expressive colouring and greater drama in their depiction of the state of mind and physical suffering that is typical of the next period of Gothic painting.\nThe Roudnice Altarpiece is one of the m\nKarel Nepraš (2 April 1932 – 5 April 2002) was a Czech sculptor, draughtsman, graphic artist and professor at Prague Academy. Already in the 1960s, Nepraš became one of the most prominent Czech artists thanks to his ability to master new materials, techniques and technologies and creatively exploit them. His original work has also been recognized abroad. Through playfulness, subversive irony and bitter humour, he has kept himself free from pathos, pretension and any ideological cliché. Nepraš's work is often classified as part of the so-called Czech Grotesque, which partly overlapped with New Figuration, but the term was rather a substitute for such notions as alienation, absurdity and manipulation, which were unacceptable to the then communist regime. With the rapid deterioration of state cultural policy under normalization, the grotesque acted as a distinctly intellectual commentary on reality. According to art historian Jan Kříž, there are only a few sculptors in the world who could so perfectly connect the tragicomedy of human existence with the tragicomedy of general history.\nThe period of normalization he experienced in difficult existential conditions, without the possibility to exhibit and in seclusion. He received recognition again only after the the fall of the communist regime, when he was appointed professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague. A number of prominent personalities emerged from the Karel Nepraš School Socha 1, such as the sculptors Paulina Skavova, Martina Hozová, Klára Klose and Markéta Korečková, the sculptors Karel Bartáček, Zdeněk Šmíd, Vít Novotný, Ján Macko and the painter MICL. In addition to teaching students, Nepraš devoted himself intensively to his own work and is considered one of the most original representatives of New Figuration.\n\n\n== Life ==\nKarel Nepraš was born on 2 April 1932 in Prague. He was born into the family of a bank clerk. Thanks to his art teacher at the town school, who encouraged his interest in drawing and advised him, he saw several exhibitions before the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état. In 1948–1951, he graduated from the Secondary Industrial Ceramic School in Prague, where Bedřich Dlouhý also studied. In 1952 he was admitted to the Academy of Fine Arts in the sculpture studio of Prof. Jan Lauda, and in 1958 he graduated as an academic sculptor.\nBefore the war, Jan Lauda was a leading representative of so-called social art and had excellent training (pupil of Jan Štursa, shared studio with Otto Gutfreund). He was a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and in 1951 he was awarded the State Prize of Klement Gottwald for his bust of V. I. Lenin. Karel Nepraš was a prominent student of Lauda, and his professor actively protected him, giving him repeatedly excellent marks in sculpture. He also saved him from being expelled from Academy when Nepraš repeatedly failed exams in Marxism-Leninism and Lauda convinced the examining comrade to give him at least a C. At the end of his studies he defended Nepraš's diploma thesis - an unconventional monument to the pioneer of aeronautics E. Čihák. From the practice of the ceramicist and the principles of the Lauda school on the necessity to maintain the solid construction of the sculpture, Nepraš took away the inclination towards a convex shape, which \"is the vault that holds the space\"\n\n\n==== Šmidra group ====\nIn the oppressive atmosphere of the communist regime of the 1950s, the general spying and the emphasis on teaching Marxism–Leninism and socialist realism at the Academy, personal friendships and private gatherings of students were more important than school. Nepraš and his friends were aware that they stood completely outside official art, and prank was a necessary common self-defence.\nTogether with his classmates Jan Koblasa, Bedřich Dlouhý and musicians Rudolf Komorous, Libor Pešek and Jan Klusák, he founded the Club (in the manner of English gentlemen's clubs), which prepared a joint Dadaist event of artists, acto\nA ring diacritic may appear above or below letters. It may be combined with some letters of the extended Latin alphabets in various contexts.\n\n\n== Rings ==\n\n\n=== Distinct letter ===\nThe character Å (å) is derived from an A with a ring. It is a distinct letter in the Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, Walloon, and Chamorro alphabets. For example, the 29-letter Swedish alphabet begins with the basic 26 Latin letters and ends with the three letters Å, Ä, and Ö.\n\n\n=== Overring ===\n\nThe character Ů (ů) a Latin U with overring, or kroužek is a grapheme in Czech preserved for historic reasons, and represented a vowel shift. For example, the word for \"horse\" used to be written kóň, which evolved, along with pronunciation, into kuoň. Ultimately, the vowel [o] disappeared completely, and the uo evolved into ů, modern form kůň. The letter ů now has the same pronunciation as the letter ú (long [uː]), but changes to a short o when a word is morphed (e.g. nom. kůň → gen. koně, nom. dům → gen. domu), thus showing the historical evolution of the language. Ů cannot occur in initial position, while ú occurs almost exclusively in initial position or at the beginning of a word root in a compound, a common example of this is the word for \"triangle\" trojúhelník. These characters are used also in Steuer's Silesian alphabet. The [uo] pronunciation has prevailed in some Moravian dialects, as well as in Slovak, which uses the letter ô instead of ů.\nThe ring is used in some dialects of Emilian and Romagnol to distinguish the sound /ʌ/ (å) from /a/ (a).\nů was used in Old Lithuanian in Lithuania Minor from the 16th till the beginning of the 20th century and for a shorter time in 16th-century Lithuania Major for diphthong [uo].\nThe ring was used in the Lithuanian Cyrillic alphabet promoted by Russian authorities in the last quarter of the 19th century with the letter У̊ / у̊  used to represent the /wɔ/ diphthong (now written uo in Lithuanian orthography).\nẘ and ẙ are used in the ISO 233 romanization of the Arabic alphabet. A fatḥah followed by the letter ⟨ﻭ⟩ (wāw) with a sukūn (ـَوْ) is romanized as aẘ. A fatḥah followed by the letter ⟨ﻱ⟩ (yā’) with a sukūn over it (ـَيْ) is romanized as aẙ.\nRing upon e (e̊) is used by certain dialectologists of Walloon (especially Jean-Jacques Gaziaux) to note the /ə/ vowel typically replacing /i/ and /y/ in the Brabant province central Walloon dialects. The difficulty of type-writing it has led some writers to prefer ë for the same sound.\nMany more characters can be created in Unicode using the combining character U+030A ◌̊ COMBINING RING ABOVE, including the above-mentioned у̊ (Cyrillic у with overring) or ń̊ (n with acute and overring).\nThe standalone (spacing) symbol is U+02DA ˚ RING ABOVE.\nThe unrelated, but nearly identical degree symbol is U+00B0 ° DEGREE SIGN.\nAlthough similar in appearance, it is not to be confused with the Japanese handakuten (U+309A ◌゚ COMBINING KATAKANA-HIRAGANA SEMI-VOICED SOUND MARK), a diacritic used with the kana for syllables starting with h to indicate that they should instead be pronounced with [p]. In Japanese dialectology, handakuten is used with kana for syllables starting with k to indicate their consonant is [ŋ], with syllables starting with r to indicate their consonant is l though this does not change the pronunciation, with kana u to indicate its morph into kana n, and with kana i to indicate the vowel is to be said as [ɨ].\nIn Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics, there are two ring characters: ᐤ (Cree and Ojibwe final w, or Sayisi o) and ᣞ (Cree and Ojibwe final w or final y).  This second smaller ring can combine as a diacritic ring above in Moose Cree and Moose-Cree influenced Ojibwe as a final y;  in Inuktitut, the ring above the /_i/ character turns it into a /_aai/ character.  In Western Cree, /_w_w/ sequence is represented as ᐝ.\nIn addition to the combining character option, Unicode has some precomposed characters:\n\n\n=== Underring ===\n\nThe underring is used in IPA to indicate \nTomas Sedlacek (born 23 January 1977 in Prague) gained widespread international recognition for his book on philosophy and economy \"Economics of Good and Evil\" (Oxford University Press), which has been translated into 22 languages.

It has about 2,200 inhabitants. It lies on the Ohře River. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.\n\n\n== Administrative parts ==\nThe villages of Břežany nad Ohří, Kostelec nad Ohří, Nížebohy, Písty, Roudníček and Vrbka are administrative parts of Budyně nad Ohří.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name Budyně is derived from the personal name Buda, meaning \"Buda's (village)\".\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBudyně nad Ohří is located about 15 kilometres (9 mi) south of Litoměřice and 38 km (24 mi) northwest of Prague. It lies in a flat and mainly agricultural landscape of the Lower Ohře Table. The Ohře River flows through the town.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first written mention of Budyně nad Ohří is from 1173. Originally there was a wooden castle, but it was rebuilt to a Gothic stone castle by King Ottokar I at the beginning of the 13th century. King John of Bohemia sold Budyně to the noble family of Zajíc of Hazmburk, who owned it until 1613. During their rule, the castle and the whole estate prospered and developed.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n== Transport ==\nBudyně nad Ohří is located on the railway from Roudnice nad Labem to Libochovice. Historic trains run on it and it is only in operation during the summer tourist season on weekends.\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\nBudyně nad Ohří is known for its water castle. Since 1946, it has been owned by the town. In the 1920s, the Janda's Museum was founded in the premises of the castle with an exposition of donations from travellers and private collections of the inhabitants of the region. The museum was reopened in 1997.\nThe Church of Saint Wenceslaus is the landmark of the town square. It was founded in the 13th century. After it was damaged by a fire in 1669, the originally Gothic church was rebuilt in the Baroque style. In 1710, the church was extended.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nBavor Rodovský mladší of Hustířany (1526–1591), nobleman and alchemist; died here\nPetr Čech (1944–2022), hurdler\n\n\n== Twin towns – sister cities ==\n\nBudyně nad Ohří is twinned with:\n\n Hohnstein, Germany\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nThe sub-province Mělník (Czech: Mělnická podoblast) is one two wine regions in Bohemia and consists of 37 official wine municipalities. The sub-province is situated on the Elbe river. Although it is named after the town of Mělník in central Bohemia, it contains wineyards located in many parts of Bohemia - in Prague, around Čáslav, Roudnice nad Labem, even in Trutnov under the Giant Mountains. Simply said, all vineyards in Bohemia, that are not part of the sub-province Litoměřice, belong to the sub-province Mělník.\n\n\n== Mělník ==\nMělník lies on the confluence of Elbe and Vltava rivers. This area has been known since the medieval for Pinot noir. This sort has been brought from Burgundy together with French wine growers.\n\n\n== Prague ==\nThe wine production was very important for Prague. The vineyards produced wine for the royal court. The wine history of Prague is still present in local names, for example, one the Prague quarters is called Vinohrady (the Czech word for vineyards). However, wine production is recently somewhat less intensive. Small vineyards have remained in Trója or Malá Strana, the wine grown there is quite exclusive and expensive. The typical sort is Müller Thurgau.\n\n\n== Other areas ==\nEspecially Roudnice nad Labem also has rich history of wineries. Vineyards may also be found around the towns of Čáslav, Kolín, Kutná Hora, Trutnov and Beroun (this only town lies southward of Prague and thus has no relation to Elbe river).\n\n\n== References ==\nThe House of Lobkowicz (Lobkovicové in modern Czech, sg. z Lobkovic; Lobkowitz in German) is an important Bohemian noble family that dates back to the 14th century and is one of the oldest noble families of the region. Over the centuries, the family expanded their possessions through marriage with the most powerful families of the region, which resulted in gaining vast territories all across central Europe. Due to that, the family was also incorporated into the German, Austrian and Belgian nobility. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe first Lobkowiczs were members of the gentry of north-eastern Bohemia in the late 14th century. On 3 August 1459 they were granted the title of Freiherr. In the 17th century, members of the family were awarded with the title of Prince, which was granted to them on 17 October 1623 by Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1786, Emperor Joseph II further ennobled the 7th Prince when he created him Duke of Roudnice (Herzog von Raudnitz in German, vévoda roudnický in Czech).\nThe family's Imperial immediacy over Princely county of Störnstein was mediatized to Bavaria in 1807.

It was owned by the noble Lobkowitz family.\nToday, it houses the theatre museum, which is a part of the Kunsthistorisches Museum.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe palace is located on the Lobkowitzplatz, a square which previously had been called the \"pig market\", at which time it was a less distinguished address. The Lobkowitz Palace ranks among the oldest palace buildings of Vienna. The palace is the first important baroque city palace built after the Battle of Vienna (die zweite Türkenbelagerung), when the aristocracy no longer had to invest its money only for military purposes.\nThe palace façade, unlike its interior, is still to a large extent in its original condition from the time of its construction. The original building that stood where the palace now stands was sold in 1685 by Leopold Baron von Felss to the imperial Colonel stable master Philipp Sigmund count von Dietrichstein. This led to the current palace, built between 1685 and 1687 by Giovanni Pietro Tencala. The new palace occupied not only the site of the house of the Baron von Felss, but also the original site of a neighbouring bathhouse, which was also bought by Philipp Sigmund Count von Dietrichstein.\nAfter repeated ownership changes (among the owners, Count Wenzel Gallas), the palace was bought in 1745 by Ferdinand Philipp Prince von Lobkowitz.\nThe palace remained from that time up to 1980 in the possession of the Lobkowitz family.\nUnder the Lobkowitz family, the palace underwent several renovations. At the beginning of the 18th century, most notably, Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach and his son Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach were entrusted with the project.\nIn the early 19th century, Ludwig van Beethoven was often a guest in the palace, since the owner at that time, Joseph Franz Maximilian von Lobkowitz, was an important patron of the composer. Beethoven's Third Symphony was dedicated to the prince,\nwhich is why the festival room of the palace was named \"Eroica Hall\".\nIn 1804,\nBeethoven's Third Symphony was performed for the first time in Vienna in this hall, with the composer as conductor.\nDuring the Congress of Vienna, numerous celebrations and balls were held in the palace. Around the  middle of the 19th century, the Lobkowitzes transferred their major residence to their hereditary palace in Roudnice nad Labem, northern Bohemia, and released their Viennese residence for letting.\nBetween 1869 and 1909, the house was used as the French embassy.\nFrom 1919 to 1938, the Czechoslovakian legation was accommodated there.\nAfter end of the Second World War, the house was used as seat of the Institut Français de Vienne.\nIn  1980, the palace became government property, and since 1991, after a comprehensive renovation, it has served as the theatre museum of the Kunsthistorisches Museum.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLobkowicz Palace\nLobkowicz family\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nHomepage of Theatermuseum – museum group in the Palace\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\"Homepage of Theatermuseum, with gallery of the Palace\". www.theatermuseum.at (in German).

The original building that stood where the palace now stands was sold in 1685 by Leopold Baron von Felss to the imperial Colonel stable master Philipp Sigmund count von Dietrichstein. This led to the current palace, built between 1685 and 1687 by Giovanni Pietro Tencala. The new palace occupied not only the site of the house of the Baron von Felss, but also the original site of a neighbouring bathhouse, which was also bought by Philipp Sigmund Count von Dietrichstein.\nAfter repeated ownership changes (among the owners, Count Wenzel Gallas), the palace was bought in 1745 by Ferdinand Philipp Prince von Lobkowitz.\nThe palace remained from that time up to 1980 in the possession of the Lobkowitz family."

At the beginning of the 18th century, most notably, Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach and his son Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach were entrusted with the project.\nIn the early 19th century, Ludwig van Beethoven was often a guest in the palace, since the owner at that time, Joseph Franz Maximilian von Lobkowitz, was an important patron of the composer. Beethoven's Third Symphony was dedicated to the prince,\nwhich is why the festival room of the palace was named \"Eroica Hall\".\nIn 1804,\nBeethoven's Third Symphony was performed for the first time in Vienna in this hall, with the composer as conductor."
