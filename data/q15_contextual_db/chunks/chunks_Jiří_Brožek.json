He came from a poor background and worked in blue-collar jobs before being accepted as an exceptional talent to study at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague. He took manual jobs also as a student and graduate to keep his personal and creative freedom. He is an amateur boxer, founder of the Boxart group.\nHis life was brutally affected by the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia and he was deeply touched by the sacrifice of Jan Palach. Sozanský was active organizer of various unofficial meetings and artistic activities at the Terezín Memorial or Old Most, demolished for coal mining, throughout the normalization until the fall of the communist regime. Then in the communist prison in Valdice and communist concentration camps at uranium mines in the Příbram District, or in besieged Sarajevo. In his work he consistently commemorates political prisoners and victims of the communist regime (Milada Horáková, Jan Zahradníček, Ivan Martin Jirous, Václav Havel, and others) and refers to literature sources, such as Samuel Beckett's Stories and Texts for Nothing, Orwell's novel 1984, and Václav Havel, Primo Levi's and Rudolf Höss's writings. He is a recipient of the award Knight of Czech Culture, the certificate Participant of the Resistance and Opposition to Communism and was awarded For his extraordinary contribution to the reflection of modern history by the Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes. He is the author of the triptych Jan Palach - Ascension at Karolinum and Memorial to the Victims of the August 1968 Invasion and the Victims of the 1969 Protests for Wenceslas Square.\n\n\n== Life ==\nJiří Sozanský was born on 27 June 1946 in Prague. He was born to parents who met on the barricades during the Prague Uprising and married soon after. He never knew his biological father Ivan Sozansky, who came from Subcarpatian Ukraine. Ivan Sozansky was arrested in 1948 while trying to cross the state border, but managed to escape from prison. It has not been possible to trace whether he was forcibly deported to the Soviet Union after the war. In 1952 a court declared Ivan Sozanský missing.\nJiří grew up with his mother in very poor circumstances and learned early in his childhood that he had to fend for himself. His mother was a trained hairdresser and, thanks to her occupation, had a wealth of social contacts. Later she remarried and moved with Jiří to Pec pod Sněžkou for a time to meet a new partner. She separated from her partner when Jiří was 10 years old. At that time, he spent weekends and part of his holidays with his grandmother Veronika and aunt Milena, where he met a year older Josef Kapín, later boxing champion, with whom he met again as an adult during boxing training. Aunt Milena worked as a curator at the National Gallery, where Jiří sometimes came to see her with his mother and learned about Czech Baroque art. Around the age of 13, his mother arranged a visit of the sculptor Jan Kodet, who first bought his drawing and encouraged him to become an artist.\nAfter graduating from primary school, he trained as a mason in the company Pozemní stavby (Ground Construction) in 1960–1963. Active sportsmen worked as teachers at the school and under the influence of Václav Pšenička Jiří Sozanský started to train weightlifting at the age of 15. The librarian of Pozemní stavby introduced Sozanský to the music theorist Jaromír Paclt, who lent him books by French existentialists and publications on modern world art. Thanks to Paclt, he also met Zbyněk Sekal. Artist of the enterprise Zdeněk Fultner founded an art club for him, provided him with painting materials and supported him in his preparation for studying at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague. After graduating from the apprenticeship, he passed the entrance exams for evening studies at the Václav Hollar School of Graphic Arts, but was dissatisfied with the low standard of the local teachers and left the sc\nWaiter, Scarper! (Czech: Vrchní, prchni!) is a 1981 Czechoslovak comedy film directed by Ladislav Smoljak. It is also known in English as 'Run, Waiter, Run!'.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAt his high school reunion, the mild-mannered Dalibor Vrána learns, to his chagrin, that some of his former classmates own villas and take international vacations. He feels dejected because he merely manages a bookstore, drives a dilapidated three-wheeled Velorex, and is chronically short on cash, in part because he owes alimony to two ex-wives, and a third wife is worried they can't pay their bills. When a drunk stranger in a restaurant mistakes Vrána for a waiter, he sees a silver lining. He starts slipping into restaurants, wearing the old tuxedo he wore to his high school reunion, and settling up the bills of diners whose real waiters have left them hanging. Soon he is able to afford a new car, though he has to hide it from the neighbors, lest they get suspicious, and drives to it in his old one. He can even afford to round up his children from their various mothers and take them on a skiing vacation. But soon the police and the press are onto him, not to mention a slew of indignant authentic waiters.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe idea for the movie came to the scriptwriter Zdeněk Svěrák in the early 1970s, when Svěrák slipped out of the Prague theater Malostranská Beseda, during the intermission of an opening night performance, to eat a quick dinner at U Schnellů, the pub next door. As soon as he entered the pub, he saw a forest of raised hands—impatient diners who wanted to pay and mistook him, because of his dark suit and bowtie, for one of the pub's waiters. Svěrák first offered the script to Jiří Menzel, who passed because he thought the material was too thin for a feature-length film. Svěrák hoped the actor Petr Nárožný would play the Vrána character, but Smoljak worried that Nárožný had become typecast by having played the \"infuriated idiot\" too many times recently, and cast Josef Abrhám instead. Smoljak revised Svěrák's script extensively, dropping, for example, a scene where Vrána escapes from a seafood restaurant because a fishing net on the ceiling drops on his pursuers, and adding a scene in which Vrána flits from one restaurant booth to another, expertly dodging the restaurant's real waiters. Smoljak insisted on filming that scene, as well as a late one, set in Karlovy Vary's Grandhotel Pupp, in a single take, because, he said, \"we wanted the viewer to be able to see for himself every move, to see that coordination, whether it clicks or not.

The focus is on a 20-something couple with unspecified learning difficulties, Olinka (Kateřina Holánová) and Standa (Jan Budař), who are preparing to have sex for the first time. Standa has been receiving advice from his brother Jarda (Martin Pechlát), while Olinka has been given tips and guidance by her friends, the women who live in her apartment block. Standa and Jarda travel to Brno from Brundal for the occasion.\nMeanwhile, in a nearby pub, depressed actor Mirek (Miroslav Donutil) is with psychologist Vlasta (Pavla Tomicová), complaining about his life, and the two presently return to Vlasta's flat together where they have sex, and Vlasta counsels Mirek about the state of his marriage. In the same pub are Jaroslava (Ivana Uhlířová), a young woman who habitually attracts unpleasant men, and her current partner Richard (Marek Daniel), a pretentious and self-absorbed man who is tempted by sexual experimentation and submission. This couple return to Richard's flat in the same apartment block where Richard persuades an unwilling Jaroslava to spank him, alongside other requests. Also in the pub are life-long friends Honza (Pavel Liška) and Pavel (Filip Rajmont). While Honza rambles drunkenly about his desire for various women, Pavel has an undeclared love for Honza.\nAt the house, Olinka is horrified to see her controlling mother return unexpectedly to the flat. Panicking, she administers rohypnol into her mother's coffee, and locks her unconscious in a storage cupboard. Standa arrives and they visit Olinka's friends so Standa can be vetted for their approval. Back down in Olinka's flat, Standa and Olinka share an awkward meal, and then proceed to the bedroom and are extremely nervous, but eventually Olinka manages to initiate sex. Despite Jarda's training, Standa is unable to put on the condom, so they do not use one. Meanwhile Jarda arrives at Olinka's friends' party upstairs to drink with them.\nMeanwhile, Mirek leaves Vlasta's house to go home, but on the way has a drunken argument with his wife on the phone, and ends up walking home to Líšeň in a drunken depression. Honza and Pavel also head home to Pavel's house, and Pavel is perturbed when Honza kisses his cheek while he sleeps. After having sex, Olinka excitedly tells her friends what happened, but at the same time her mother wakes up and sees Standa dancing in his underwear through the keyhole. When Olinka returns to the flat, the two women argue, and Standa flees the flat in panic.\nPavel and Honza leave Pavel's place very early to deliver rohlík to Líšeň, but on the way Pavel takes his eyes off the road and hits Mirek, killing him. Comforting Pavel, Honza confides that his love is returned. Meanwhile, Olinka releases her mother from the pantry, but then locks her in again when Standa returns to her. A voice over confirms that Olinka is pregnant.\n\n\n== External links ==\nNuda v Brně at IMDb\nWolf's Hole (Czech: Vlčí bouda) is a 1986 Czechoslovak science fiction horror film directed by Věra Chytilová.

The retrospective passages, which make up most of the film, span Cimrman's whole \"known\" life, where he interacts with many personalities of Czech and European science and culture in the Belle Époque. A large portion of the film deals with Cimrman's acting as a tutor in the family of Franz Ferdinand d'Este, the heir presumptive of Austria-Hungary.

Rudolf Hrušínský plays the starring role and is joined in the cast by others including Josef Abrhám, Daniela Kolářová, and Zita Kabátová.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nDr. Radosta organizes a twelve-apartment swap on request of people interested in the swap of apartment in Prague, which he called \"Ball Lightning\", because it had to take place quickly, energetically and all at once. Doctor Radosta is assisted among those involved in the swap by Mr. Knotek as his assistant engineer Severín, who has a reliable car including home-made car airbags, as a messenger. In order to be able to carry out the \"biggest event in the history of moving\", as the group's organizer describes it, Dr. Radosta unbeknownst the wedding of the older couple engaged Mr. Flieger and Mrs. Opatrná on a different date and place, because they must be married before the swap takes place from legal reasons of the time story happened. For this reason, Mr. Knotek must represent the groom's original witness. The wedding festivities result in a nightly moving exercise organized by the drunken Mr. Knotek, after which especially the punctual inspector Mr. Drahota wants to resign from his swap. Dr. Radosta convinces him to stay among the participants, and Mr. Knotek must personally apologize to everyone for the night's disturbance.\nIn last days before the swap of Mrs. Jechová apartment complicate situation, although she originally had no objections to apartment with family Knotek, she additionally demands the Knotek´s washing machine from them because there is not laundry in the house, and she also demands the replacement of the basement storage cellar, which is in her view be too far and too deep. However, for Mr. Knotek, swap of the basement storage cellars with the unpopular neighbor Klabouch also represents a laborious mutual exchange of their coal. Mrs. Jechová surprisingly praises the attic (for drying the clothes) in the house, when the Knotek´s were afraid of further complications from her about the attic as well.\nEven the moving process itself is not without problems, it seems at first that the whole swap will be ruined by Mrs. Jechová, who refuses to move out because of memories of her deceased husband. In the end, however, she allows herself to be convinced. Another complication is with old opera master Bílek, whom Mr. Knotek cannot wake up and believe he have died. If he were dead, the swap could not take place, because legally he would not voluntarily move out of the apartment. Therefore, together with Doctor Radosta, they decide to move Master Bílek's body covered by duvets on the couch to a new apartment and pretend that he died there. However, the couch in question was previously purchased from Master Bílek by the antiques collector Doctor Ječný who demands his couch. At first, they tries to hide the alleged death of master Bílek to him, but Doctor Ječný won't let himself be brush off. After unpacking the couch, he discovers that the couch has been exchanged for a similar piece by Mr. Flieger and Mrs. Opatrná. They rush to where the second couch has been moved so that no one else will uncover the duvets. However, it is eventually discovered that the master Bílek did not actually die, he was merely fast asleep after an all-night packing. The entire twelve apartments swap will therefore be successful. During the closing credits, we see how Dr. Radosta is planning another swap, this time twenty-four apartment swap, under the name \"Ball Lightning II\" (whereby the names on the diagram belong to the crew members).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBall Lightning at IMDb\nThe Last Butterfly (Czech: Poslední motýl; French: La dernier papillon) is a 1990 Czech–French holocaust drama film directed by Karel Kachyňa based on the book The Last Butterfly by Canadian author Michael Jacot.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nTom Courtenay as Antoine Moreau\nBrigitte Fossey as Věra\nIngrid Held as Michèle\nFreddie Jones as Conductor Karl Rheinberg\nMilan Kňažko as Commandant Gruber\nJosef Kemr as Leo Stadler\nDrahomíra Fialková as Leo Stadler's wife\nPavel Bobek as Silberstein\nJosef Laufer as Petersen\nHana Hegerová as Singer\nLinda Jablonská as Stella\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe movie had a premiere in Czechoslovakia in 1991.

The sweet-tempered Otík works as a truck driver assistant to Mr. Pávek, his older colleague, and practical-minded neighbor. Pávek's family and Otík's aunt Hrabětová take care of Otík, whose parents are dead. However, the two truck coworkers become at odds over Otík's inability to perform even the simplest tasks. Pávek demands that Otík be transferred to assist another driver, who happens to be a choleric and suspicious man named Turek. Rather than work with Turek, Otík decides to accept an offer of employment in Prague but finds he does not fit into city life. After discovering that the transfer of Otík to Prague was a trick by a crooked subordinate of the Dřevoplech company director to get a deal on Otík's large inherited house for his boss, Pávek agrees to give Otík a second chance and retrieves him from the city to resume their work together.\nThe film also follows several subplots, such as the secret romance of Turek's wife with a young veterinarian, the tribulations of an accident-prone but respected doctor who has almost as much trouble with his pessimistic patients as he does with his car, and the desperate deeds of Pávek's teenage son, who has ardent feelings for an attractive local teacher.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nJános Bán as Ota Rákosník\nMarián Labuda as Karel Pávek\nRudolf Hrušínský as Dr. Skružný\nPetr Čepek as Josef Turek\nLibuše Šafránková as Jana Turková\nJan Hartl as Václav Kašpar\nMiloslav Štibich as Vojtěch Kalina\nOldřich Vlach as Jaromír Kunc\nMilada Ježková as Ludmila Hrabětová\nZdeněk Svěrák as Painter Evžen Ryba\nJosef Somr as Director of Dřevoplech\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn the Czech Republic and Slovakia the movie retains a cult following. It's also popular in Hungary where main actor János Bán is from. The movie gained favorable reviews from movie critics, with Roger Ebert awarding the movie 3 and a half stars out of 4. \"In My Sweet Little Village, (Menzel) discovers some of the same gentle, ironic humor that Forman found in The Fireman's Ball. He uses everyday life as an instrument for a subtle attack on bureaucracy and a cheerful assertion of human nature.
