The focus is on a 20-something couple with unspecified learning difficulties, Olinka (Kate\u0159ina Hol\u00e1nov\u00e1) and Standa (Jan Buda\u0159), who are preparing to have sex for the first time. Standa has been receiving advice from his brother Jarda (Martin Pechl\u00e1t), while Olinka has been given tips and guidance by her friends, the women who live in her apartment block. Standa and Jarda travel to Brno from Brundal for the occasion.\nMeanwhile, in a nearby pub, depressed actor Mirek (Miroslav Donutil) is with psychologist Vlasta (Pavla Tomicov\u00e1), complaining about his life, and the two presently return to Vlasta's flat together where they have sex, and Vlasta counsels Mirek about the state of his marriage. In the same pub are Jaroslava (Ivana Uhl\u00ed\u0159ov\u00e1), a young woman who habitually attracts unpleasant men, and her current partner Richard (Marek Daniel), a pretentious and self-absorbed man who is tempted by sexual experimentation and submission. This couple return to Richard's flat in the same apartment block where Richard persuades an unwilling Jaroslava to spank him, alongside other requests. Also in the pub are life-long friends Honza (Pavel Li\u0161ka) and Pavel (Filip Rajmont). While Honza rambles drunkenly about his desire for various women, Pavel has an undeclared love for Honza.\nAt the house, Olinka is horrified to see her controlling mother return unexpectedly to the flat. Panicking, she administers rohypnol into her mother's coffee, and locks her unconscious in a storage cupboard. Standa arrives and they visit Olinka's friends so Standa can be vetted for their approval. Back down in Olinka's flat, Standa and Olinka share an awkward meal, and then proceed to the bedroom and are extremely nervous, but eventually Olinka manages to initiate sex. Despite Jarda's training, Standa is unable to put on the condom, so they do not use one. Meanwhile Jarda arrives at Olinka's friends' party upstairs to drink with them.\nMeanwhile, Mirek leaves Vlasta's house to go home, but on the way has a drunken argument with his wife on the phone, and ends up walking home to L\u00ed\u0161e\u0148 in a drunken depression. Honza and Pavel also head home to Pavel's house, and Pavel is perturbed when Honza kisses his cheek while he sleeps. After having sex, Olinka excitedly tells her friends what happened, but at the same time her mother wakes up and sees Standa dancing in his underwear through the keyhole. When Olinka returns to the flat, the two women argue, and Standa flees the flat in panic.\nPavel and Honza leave Pavel's place very early to deliver rohl\u00edk to L\u00ed\u0161e\u0148, but on the way Pavel takes his eyes off the road and hits Mirek, killing him. Comforting Pavel, Honza confides that his love is returned. Meanwhile, Olinka releases her mother from the pantry, but then locks her in again when Standa returns to her. A voice over confirms that Olinka is pregnant.\n\n\n== External links ==\nNuda v Brn\u011b at IMDb\nJan Buda\u0159 (born 31 July 1977) is a Czech actor, director, singer, composer and script writer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBuda\u0159 was born in Fr\u00fddlant near Liberec.

Based on the folktale Otes\u00e1nek by Karel Jarom\u00edr Erben, the film is a comedic live action, stop motion-animated feature film set mainly in an apartment building in the Czech Republic.\nThe film uses the Overture to Der Freisch\u00fctz (1821) by Carl Maria von Weber as the score.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nKarel Hor\u00e1k (Jan Hartl) and Bo\u017eena Hor\u00e1kov\u00e1 (Veronika \u017dilkov\u00e1) are a childless couple and for medical reasons are doomed to remain so. While on vacation with their neighbors, the Stadlers at a house in the country, Karel decides to buy the house at the suggestion of Mr. Stadler. When he is fixing up the house, he digs up a tree stump that looks vaguely like a baby. He spends the rest of the evening cleaning it up and then presents it to his wife. She names the stump Ot\u00edk and starts to treat it like a real baby. She then works out a plan to fake her pregnancy and becoming more and more impatient she speeds up the process and 'gives birth' one month early.\nOt\u00edk comes alive and has an insatiable appetite. Al\u017eb\u011btka (Kristina Adamcov\u00e1), the Stadlers\u2019 daughter, has been suspicious all along, and when she reads the fairy tale about Otes\u00e1nek, the truth becomes clear to her. Meanwhile, little Ot\u00edk has been just eating and growing. At one point he eats some of Bo\u017eena's hair, and another day she returns home to find that Ot\u00edk has eaten their cat. Karel and his wife are at odds with Karel pushing for killing the creature and Bo\u017eena defending it as their child. The baby later consumes a postal worker (Gustav Vondr\u00e1\u010dek) and then a social worker (Jitka Smutn\u00e1).\nThe resulting deaths lead Karel to tie up and lock Ot\u00edk away in the basement of their apartment building, leaving Ot\u00edk to starve. Al\u017eb\u011btka secretly takes over as prime caretaker. She tries to keep Ot\u00edk fed with normal human food, but, when her mother stops her, she is forced to drawing straws (matches in this case) to choose a person to feed to Ot\u00edk. The chosen victim is an old man and pedophile, Mr. \u017dl\u00e1bek (Zden\u011bk Koz\u00e1k) who has been stalking her recently. Deciding she cannot take the stalking anymore, Al\u017eb\u011btka lures Mr. \u017dl\u00e1bek to the basement where he gets entangled by Otik's vines and devoured. Karel himself later becomes a victim when he comes into the basement with a chainsaw but on seeing Ot\u00edk he hesitates and calls him \"son\" before dropping the chainsaw. Afterwards, Bo\u017eena goes into the basement and is heard screaming; having become a victim herself. In the end, Ot\u00edk disobeys Al\u017eb\u011btka despite repeated warnings and eats all of Mrs. Spr\u00e1vcov\u00e1's (Dagmar St\u0159\u00edbrn\u00e1) cabbage patch, prompting the old woman to take charge.\n\n\n=== Ending ===\nIn the fairy tale upon which the movie is based, the old woman kills Otes\u00e1nek by splitting his stomach open with a hoe; however, the film ends with her descending the stairs, Al\u017eb\u011btka reciting the end of the fairy tale tearfully; the audience is not allowed to witness the deed.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nVeronika \u017dilkov\u00e1 as Bo\u017eena Hor\u00e1kov\u00e1\nJan Hartl as Karel Hor\u00e1k\nKristina Adamcov\u00e1 as Al\u017eb\u011btka\nJaroslava Kretschmerov\u00e1 as Al\u017eb\u011btka's Mother\nPavel Nov\u00fd as Al\u017eb\u011btka's Father\nDagmar Str\u00edbrn\u00e1 as Pani spravcova (the caretaker)\nZdenek Koz\u00e1k as Mr. \u017dl\u00e1bek\nGustav Vondracek as Ml\u00e1dek, the Postman\nJitka Smutn\u00e1 as Bulankov\u00e1, the Social worker\n\n\n== Reception ==\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 84% based on 44 reviews, with a weighted average rating of 7/10.

He has lost his previous job at the Czech Philharmonic, having been blacklisted as \"politically unreliable\" by the authorities. A friend offers him a chance to earn a great deal of money through a sham marriage to a Russian woman to enable her to stay in Czechoslovakia. The woman then uses her new citizenship to emigrate to West Germany, where her boyfriend lives.\nDue to a concurrence of circumstances, she has to leave behind her 5-year-old son, Kolya, for the disgruntled Czech musician to look after. At first Louka and Kolya have communication difficulties, as they don't speak each other's languages and the many false friend words that exist in Czech and Russian add to the confusion. Gradually, though, a bond forms between Louka and Kolya. The child suffers from suspected meningitis and has to be placed on a course of carefully monitored antibiotics. Louka is threatened with imprisonment for his suspect marriage and the child may be placed in a Soviet children's home. The Velvet Revolution intervenes though, and Kolya is reunited with his mother.

The stage drama is transferred to the real world when a tragedy occurs during rehearsal involving one of the spectators. \n\n\n== Cast ==\nMichaela Badinkov\u00e1 as Katya\nIgor Chmela as Ivan Karamazov\nRadek Holub as Smerdyakov\nLenka Krobotov\u00e1 as Grushenka\nDavid Novotn\u00fd as Dmitriy Karamazov\nIvan Trojan as Stary Karamazov\nMartin My\u0161i\u010dka as Alyosha Karamazov\nJerzy Michal Bozyk as Pianist\nMalgorzata Galkowska\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nKaramazovi won the International Federation of Film Critics (FIPRESCI) award in Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in 2008 and was submitted by The Czech Republic for the 2009 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBratya Karamazovy, a 1969 Soviet adaptation of the same novel\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nKaramazovi at IMDb\nPavla Tomicov\u00e1 (born 25 June 1962) is a Czech actress.

Eventually Jan finds employment in Prague at the Hotel Pa\u0159\u00ed\u017e, where he falls under the tutelage of the Ma\u00eetre d', Sk\u0159iv\u00e1nek, who claims that he once served the King of England [sic]. Eventually, Jan serves the Emperor of Ethiopia on one occasion. The Emperor tries to award Sk\u0159iv\u00e1nek a medal, but is too short to place the award around Sk\u0159iv\u00e1nek's neck. Jan is short enough for the Emperor to reach, and maneuvers to receive the medal in Sk\u0159iv\u00e1nek's place.\nWith the Third Reich's annexation of Czechoslovakia, Jan falls in love with Liza, a young Sudeten German woman who worships Adolf Hitler. She agrees to marry him only after he proves that he is of pure Aryan descent through medical examination. During the occupation, the other waiters and the hotel manager, Brandejs, express their contempt for the German occupiers by being as unhelpful as possible in their service to them. Jan is the only member of the waitstaff not to express such symbolic resistance. For this reason, Brandejs dismisses Jan, and says Jan will be blacklisted from employment in any Prague establishment. When Jan and Liza later appear as patrons, and Jan tells Sk\u0159iv\u00e1nek that serving the King of England has done him no good, Sk\u0159iv\u00e1nek pours food over Jan in protest. Soon, the occupying authorities take Sk\u0159iv\u00e1nek away and he is never seen again.\nDuring World War II, Jan works in an institute, formerly the Hotel Tichota, where German women reside to breed a new \"master race\" with selected soldiers. Because the owner, Mr Tichota, uses a wheelchair, he has been displaced as its owner and is never seen again. In the meantime, Liza serves as a nurse on the Russian front. She returns with valuable stamps taken from the homes of Polish-Jewish families. As the war progresses and the tide turns against Germany, the women are displaced from the facility, and wounded and amputee soldiers replace them. Near the war's end, the facility is attacked, and the soldiers and staff evacuated. Liza tries to retrieve the stamps from the burning building, but dies when its roof collapses on her. Jan finds her body holding the box of stamps and pries it from her hands. After the war, the stamps' value allows Jan to become a wealthy hotelier on the same premises.\nAfter the Communists take power in Czechoslovakia in 1948, Jan loses his property and wealth when he tells the Communist resistance that he himself is a millionaire. He is sentenced to prison for 15 years: one year for each of his millions. In prison, he sees that Brandejs and other formerly wealthy customers are prisoners. Jan tries to sit among th\nThe Garden (Slovak: Z\u00e1hrada) is a 1995 Slovak feature film in cooperation with French Artcam International and Czech InFilm Praha directed by Martin \u0160ul\u00edk. The film is a poetic tale of Jakub, a man in his early 30s. It reflects the relationships and desires of Jakub in the idyllic surroundings of his grandfather's garden. The Garden is one of the most recognised films of post communist Slovakia. It is especially popular in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. It won the Special Jury Prize at the 40th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in 1995, and several Czech Lions in 1996.\nThe film was selected as the Slovak entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 68th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nJakub is a daydreamer in his early 30s and is still living with his father. The father is tired of Jakub's idleness and throws him out of the flat. He tells Jakub to sell the old garden of his grandfather and to buy his own flat. Jakub retires into the neglected garden and retreats into the worn garden house from the world and from his problems. The garden turns out to be a magical place full of surprises and mysteries. Jakub stumbles across his grandfather's journal which is written in reverse script. He finds a map leading him to an old bottle of slivovice hidden years ago. Now curious Jakub must solve the mysteries of his grandfather's garden. He meets Helena, a young girl Jakub's grandfather taught to also write backwards. Strange things happen in the garden, and some of them do indeed seem like miracles. Amid the eccentric events, young Helena teaches Jakub to appreciate the delicate mysteries of life. In the end Jakub loses all his possessions but finds his peace.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of submissions to the 68th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\nList of Slovak submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Garden at IMDb\nProtector (Czech: Protektor) is a 2009 Czech film directed by Marek Najbrt. It is a story of Hana and Emil Vrbata, a couple living in German-occupied Czechoslovakia, in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, during World War II.\nThe general reception by the Czech press and the audience was extremely positive. It was selected as the Czech Republic's submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the 82nd Academy Awards.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIt is 1938 and the Nazis are just one step away from invading and occupying Czechoslovakia. Hana is a young Czech film actress who also happens to be Jewish. She has just appeared in her first feature with her leading man, an older Jewish actor, who warns her that her career is over. He furthermore tells her that their picture will \"never see the light of day\" due to the fact that the Nazis will never allow its release. He hands her a forged passport and papers to get out of the country but she throws them in the trash, not believing what he says about the imminent German invasion.\nAs the filming of the 'film within a film' is on the verge of completion, we see the two actors riding stationery bicycles with a moving image in the background. As was the usual practice in creating films in earlier days, the illusion of motion is created when the moving image flickers in the background but the object in the foreground is static. This cyclist becomes a symbol for the man who pedals furiously but is actually going nowhere. That man is the Czech \"every-man\" of 1938 who desperately wishes to escape his tragic circumstances but in reality remains motionless, trapped by the forces of tyranny. Throughout the film, we catch glimpses of the film's protagonist, Emil, pedaling furiously, superimposed over the screen's larger canvas.\nHana is married to Emil, a journalist, who is conscripted by collaborating Czech officials at the radio station where he works to serve as a radio announcer after a colleague, Franta, who will not keep his opinions about the Germans to himself, is taken away by occupying forces and later executed. Emil cooperates to protect his wife from being deported to the death camps. Emil's boss at the radio station is a Nazi sympathizer who offers him the job with the understanding that no one will bother him about his wife.\nSoon, Emil has become popular hosting a cultural program in Prague entitled \"Voices of Our Home\". Meanwhile Hana becomes bored sitting at home and jeopardizes Emil's position by leaving their apartment, usually to attend the cinema. As Hana is rebellious and exasperated, she refuses to accept how risky her position is as a Jew in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia. She is almost arrested leaving the cinema after curfew, rescued by former medical student, now morphine-addicted projectionist, Petr.\nAs tensions arise, Emil begins having an affair with former colleague and former lover of Franta, Vera. Vera is now engaged to his boss, after dumping Franta for not being able to \"listen.\" After figuring out Emil is having an affair, Hana begins seeing Petr more and more, as they both begin to take up the dangerous hobby of Petr taking pictures Hana in front of Anti-Jewish shop signs. He wants to go to bed with her but she resists his advances, eventually allowing him, however, to take pictures of her in the nude. At this point in the film, things slow down considerably as Hana is no longer talking to Emil with the conflict between the two principals, grinding to a halt.\nHana's former film co-star shows up at their apartment having just escaped from a death-transport (he never made it out of Czechoslovakia). Emil is horrified that Hana allows him to take a bath in the apartment and throws him out on the street. Enraged at Emil for throwing her ex-colleague out, Hana dons her blond wig and adopts the persona of her character from her movie and crashes Emil's boss's wedding. Emil is on the verge of being fired for his 'transgression' when Reich Protector Heydrich is assassinated by Czech pa\nUp and Down (Czech: Horem p\u00e1dem) is a 2004 Czech comedy film directed by Jan H\u0159ebejk.

Lubos and Eman make attempts to sell the baby to Miluska and Frantisek, a barren couple.

Horst, a Czech-German Nazi collaborator married to a German woman and co-worker of Josef, brings food to Josef and his wife Marie, who are Czechs. Josef hates the Nazis. When Josef finds David, who had escaped a concentration camp in occupied Poland after first being sent to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in northern Bohemia, Josef and Marie decide to hide him in their apartment. Horst makes an unannounced visit, bringing presents as usual. Marie is ambivalent about their secret: On one hand she never misses an opportunity to blame her husband for bringing in the Jew, but on the other she is merciful and sympathetic towards the poor kid locked in the closet day and night. She suggests that Josef accept Horst's job offer evicting Czech Jews from their homes, so as to get more protection and deflect possible suspicions. Josef accepts and is considered a collaborator by the neighbor Franta (who had tried to give David over to the Nazi authorities, when he first escaped from a concentration camp). Marie spends the days learning French from David and getting more and more tender toward him. Horst's visits become more frequent, and one afternoon, he attempts to rape Marie.\nJosef gets his fertility tested to confirm a long-time rumor: He can't have children. Humiliated by his earlier antics, Horst takes revenge on Marie by forcing them to provide lodging for his supervisor, a committed Nazi bureaucrat, who had suffered a stroke after Nazis killed his son for deserting the army. Marie refuses to accept him on the grounds that she is pregnant. Unfortunately, the community is well-aware that Josef and Marie are infertile, and Josef proposes that David get Marie pregnant in order to stage a \"miracle\" and avoid further investigation. After much resistance from Marie, she and David have sex. Marie becomes pregnant, and Horst eventually apologizes for his previous behavior.  As the Germans lose ground in World War II, Horst's behavior begins to change. Based on his previous suspicions that someone else is living with Josef and Marie, he redirects German authorities when the latter search the street house by house. Finally, the Germans are defeated and the Czech people take brutal revenge on them.  As the Germans are being driven out, Marie goes into labor. Josef frantically searches for a doctor, but the streets of the city are in chaos and the Nazi-affiliated doctor has already been captured.\nJosef finally finds the new ruling troika which includes his old neighbor Franta as the representative of the Czech Resistance. Unfortunately, Franta remembers him as a collaborator and orders his arrest. Josef protests his innocence and invites them to meet David as proof of his ambivalence towards the Jews, in exchange for a chance to find the Nazi doctor to deliver Marie's baby. In the jails, Josef finds that the doctor has committed suicide but also finds Horst crouched in a corner. Remembering Horst's previous actions that saved David's life, Josef tells the Czech partisan guards that Horst is his doctor. The partisans escort them to Josef's house, driving through the ruins of the city. Horst is able to quickly assume the role of Marie's doctor due to his experience delivering his own sons, much to Marie's initial horror. The partisans still want to see David in order to prove Josef's allegiance, but in the chaos and gunfire, David had hid himself elsewhere. The captain of the partisan unit, a member of the regular Czechoslovak Army, does not believe Josef's story and is about to shoot him, but David shows up at the last minute after Josef's despairing plea: \"Let us be human!\" After they all return to the household, Marie and David's son\nButtoners (Czech: Knofl\u00edk\u00e1\u0159i) is a 1997 Czech film directed by Petr Zelenka.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nPavel Zaj\u00ed\u010dek - Presenter of Radio 1\nJan Haubert - Guest of Radio 1\nSeisuke Tsukahara - Japanese man with Glasses\nMotohiro Hosoya - Japanese man with Beard\nJunzo Inokuchi - Young Japanese man\n\n\n== Awards ==\nButtoners was awarded the 1997 Czech Lion for Best Film.\n\nThe Tiger award at the Rotterdam IFF, 1997\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nButtoners at IMDb\nThe Idiot Returns (Czech: N\u00e1vrat idiota; also released as Return of the Idiot) is a 1999 Czech film directed by Sa\u0161a Gedeon.
