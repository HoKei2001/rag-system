He came from a poor background and worked in blue-collar jobs before being accepted as an exceptional talent to study at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague. He took manual jobs also as a student and graduate to keep his personal and creative freedom. He is an amateur boxer, founder of the Boxart group.\nHis life was brutally affected by the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia and he was deeply touched by the sacrifice of Jan Palach. Sozansk\u00fd was active organizer of various unofficial meetings and artistic activities at the Terez\u00edn Memorial or Old Most, demolished for coal mining, throughout the normalization until the fall of the communist regime. Then in the communist prison in Valdice and communist concentration camps at uranium mines in the P\u0159\u00edbram District, or in besieged Sarajevo.

He is the author of the triptych Jan Palach - Ascension at Karolinum and Memorial to the Victims of the August 1968 Invasion and the Victims of the 1969 Protests for Wenceslas Square.\n\n\n== Life ==\nJi\u0159\u00ed Sozansk\u00fd was born on 27 June 1946 in Prague. He was born to parents who met on the barricades during the Prague Uprising and married soon after. He never knew his biological father Ivan Sozansky, who came from Subcarpatian Ukraine. Ivan Sozansky was arrested in 1948 while trying to cross the state border, but managed to escape from prison. It has not been possible to trace whether he was forcibly deported to the Soviet Union after the war. In 1952 a court declared Ivan Sozansk\u00fd missing.\nJi\u0159\u00ed grew up with his mother in very poor circumstances and learned early in his childhood that he had to fend for himself. His mother was a trained hairdresser and, thanks to her occupation, had a wealth of social contacts. Later she remarried and moved with Ji\u0159\u00ed to Pec pod Sn\u011b\u017ekou for a time to meet a new partner. She separated from her partner when Ji\u0159\u00ed was 10 years old. At that time, he spent weekends and part of his holidays with his grandmother Veronika and aunt Milena, where he met a year older Josef Kap\u00edn, later boxing champion, with whom he met again as an adult during boxing training. Aunt Milena worked as a curator at the National Gallery, where Ji\u0159\u00ed sometimes came to see her with his mother and learned about Czech Baroque art. Around the age of 13, his mother arranged a visit of the sculptor Jan Kodet, who first bought his drawing and encouraged him to become an artist.\nAfter graduating from primary school, he trained as a mason in the company Pozemn\u00ed stavby (Ground Construction) in 1960\u20131963. Active sportsmen worked as teachers at the school and under the influence of V\u00e1clav P\u0161eni\u010dka Ji\u0159\u00ed Sozansk\u00fd started to train weightlifting at the age of 15. The librarian of Pozemn\u00ed stavby introduced Sozansk\u00fd to the music theorist Jarom\u00edr Paclt, who lent him books by French existentialists and publications on modern world art. Thanks to Paclt, he also met Zbyn\u011bk Sekal. Artist of the enterprise Zden\u011bk Fultner founded an art club for him, provided him with painting materials and supported him in his preparation for studying at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague. After graduating from the apprenticeship, he passed the entrance exams for evening studies at the V\u00e1clav Hollar School of Graphic Arts, but was dissatisfied with the low standard of the local teachers and left the sc\nWaiter, Scarper! (Czech: Vrchn\u00ed, prchni!) is a 1981 Czechoslovak comedy film directed by Ladislav Smoljak. It is also known in English as 'Run, Waiter, Run!'.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAt his high school reunion, the mild-mannered Dalibor Vr\u00e1na learns, to his chagrin, that some of his former classmates own villas and take international vacations. He feels dejected because he merely manages a bookstore, drives a dilapidated three-wheeled Velorex, and is chronically short on cash, in part because he owes alimony to two ex-wives, and a third wife is worried they can't pay their bills. When a drunk stranger in a restaurant mistakes Vr\u00e1na for a waiter, he sees a silver lining. He starts slipping into restaurants, wearing the old tuxedo he wore to his high school reunion, and settling up the bills of diners whose real waiters have left them hanging. Soon he is able to afford a new car, though he has to hide it from the neighbors, lest they get suspicious, and drives to it in his old one. He can even afford to round up his children from their various mothers and take them on a skiing vacation. But soon the police and the press are onto him, not to mention a slew of indignant authentic waiters.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe idea for the movie came to the scriptwriter Zden\u011bk Sv\u011br\u00e1k in the early 1970s, when Sv\u011br\u00e1k slipped out of the Prague theater Malostransk\u00e1 Beseda, during the intermission of an opening night performance, to eat a quick dinner at U Schnell\u016f, the pub next door. As soon as he entered the pub, he saw a forest of raised hands\u2014impatient diners who wanted to pay and mistook him, because of his dark suit and bowtie, for one of the pub's waiters. Sv\u011br\u00e1k first offered the script to Ji\u0159\u00ed Menzel, who passed because he thought the material was too thin for a feature-length film. Sv\u011br\u00e1k hoped the actor Petr N\u00e1ro\u017en\u00fd would play the Vr\u00e1na character, but Smoljak worried that N\u00e1ro\u017en\u00fd had become typecast by having played the \"infuriated idiot\" too many times recently, and cast Josef Abrh\u00e1m instead. Smoljak revised Sv\u011br\u00e1k's script extensively, dropping, for example, a scene where Vr\u00e1na escapes from a seafood restaurant because a fishing net on the ceiling drops on his pursuers, and adding a scene in which Vr\u00e1na flits from one restaurant booth to another, expertly dodging the restaurant's real waiters. Smoljak insisted on filming that scene, as well as a late one, set in Karlovy Vary's Grandhotel Pupp, in a single take, because, he said, \"we wanted the viewer to be able to see for himself every move, to see that coordination, whether it clicks or not.

The focus is on a 20-something couple with unspecified learning difficulties, Olinka (Kate\u0159ina Hol\u00e1nov\u00e1) and Standa (Jan Buda\u0159), who are preparing to have sex for the first time. Standa has been receiving advice from his brother Jarda (Martin Pechl\u00e1t), while Olinka has been given tips and guidance by her friends, the women who live in her apartment block. Standa and Jarda travel to Brno from Brundal for the occasion.\nMeanwhile, in a nearby pub, depressed actor Mirek (Miroslav Donutil) is with psychologist Vlasta (Pavla Tomicov\u00e1), complaining about his life, and the two presently return to Vlasta's flat together where they have sex, and Vlasta counsels Mirek about the state of his marriage. In the same pub are Jaroslava (Ivana Uhl\u00ed\u0159ov\u00e1), a young woman who habitually attracts unpleasant men, and her current partner Richard (Marek Daniel), a pretentious and self-absorbed man who is tempted by sexual experimentation and submission. This couple return to Richard's flat in the same apartment block where Richard persuades an unwilling Jaroslava to spank him, alongside other requests. Also in the pub are life-long friends Honza (Pavel Li\u0161ka) and Pavel (Filip Rajmont). While Honza rambles drunkenly about his desire for various women, Pavel has an undeclared love for Honza.\nAt the house, Olinka is horrified to see her controlling mother return unexpectedly to the flat. Panicking, she administers rohypnol into her mother's coffee, and locks her unconscious in a storage cupboard. Standa arrives and they visit Olinka's friends so Standa can be vetted for their approval. Back down in Olinka's flat, Standa and Olinka share an awkward meal, and then proceed to the bedroom and are extremely nervous, but eventually Olinka manages to initiate sex. Despite Jarda's training, Standa is unable to put on the condom, so they do not use one. Meanwhile Jarda arrives at Olinka's friends' party upstairs to drink with them.\nMeanwhile, Mirek leaves Vlasta's house to go home, but on the way has a drunken argument with his wife on the phone, and ends up walking home to L\u00ed\u0161e\u0148 in a drunken depression. Honza and Pavel also head home to Pavel's house, and Pavel is perturbed when Honza kisses his cheek while he sleeps. After having sex, Olinka excitedly tells her friends what happened, but at the same time her mother wakes up and sees Standa dancing in his underwear through the keyhole. When Olinka returns to the flat, the two women argue, and Standa flees the flat in panic.\nPavel and Honza leave Pavel's place very early to deliver rohl\u00edk to L\u00ed\u0161e\u0148, but on the way Pavel takes his eyes off the road and hits Mirek, killing him. Comforting Pavel, Honza confides that his love is returned. Meanwhile, Olinka releases her mother from the pantry, but then locks her in again when Standa returns to her.

Doctor Radosta is assisted among those involved in the swap by Mr. Knotek as his assistant engineer Sever\u00edn, who has a reliable car including home-made car airbags, as a messenger. In order to be able to carry out the \"biggest event in the history of moving\", as the group's organizer describes it, Dr. Radosta unbeknownst the wedding of the older couple engaged Mr. Flieger and Mrs. Opatrn\u00e1 on a different date and place, because they must be married before the swap takes place from legal reasons of the time story happened. For this reason, Mr. Knotek must represent the groom's original witness. The wedding festivities result in a nightly moving exercise organized by the drunken Mr. Knotek, after which especially the punctual inspector Mr. Drahota wants to resign from his swap. Dr. Radosta convinces him to stay among the participants, and Mr. Knotek must personally apologize to everyone for the night's disturbance.\nIn last days before the swap of Mrs. Jechov\u00e1 apartment complicate situation, although she originally had no objections to apartment with family Knotek, she additionally demands the Knotek\u00b4s washing machine from them because there is not laundry in the house, and she also demands the replacement of the basement storage cellar, which is in her view be too far and too deep. However, for Mr. Knotek, swap of the basement storage cellars with the unpopular neighbor Klabouch also represents a laborious mutual exchange of their coal. Mrs. Jechov\u00e1 surprisingly praises the attic (for drying the clothes) in the house, when the Knotek\u00b4s were afraid of further complications from her about the attic as well.\nEven the moving process itself is not without problems, it seems at first that the whole swap will be ruined by Mrs. Jechov\u00e1, who refuses to move out because of memories of her deceased husband. In the end, however, she allows herself to be convinced. Another complication is with old opera master B\u00edlek, whom Mr. Knotek cannot wake up and believe he have died. If he were dead, the swap could not take place, because legally he would not voluntarily move out of the apartment. Therefore, together with Doctor Radosta, they decide to move Master B\u00edlek's body covered by duvets on the couch to a new apartment and pretend that he died there. However, the couch in question was previously purchased from Master B\u00edlek by the antiques collector Doctor Je\u010dn\u00fd who demands his couch. At first, they tries to hide the alleged death of master B\u00edlek to him, but Doctor Je\u010dn\u00fd won't let himself be brush off. After unpacking the couch, he discovers that the couch has been exchanged for a similar piece by Mr. Flieger and Mrs. Opatrn\u00e1. They rush to where the second couch has been moved so that no one else will uncover the duvets. However, it is eventually discovered that the master B\u00edlek did not actually die, he was merely fast asleep after an all-night packing. The entire twelve apartments swap will therefore be successful. During the closing credits, we see how Dr. Radosta is planning another swap, this time twenty-four apartment swap, under the name \"Ball Lightning II\" (whereby the names on the diagram belong to the crew members).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBall Lightning at IMDb\nThe Last Butterfly (Czech: Posledn\u00ed mot\u00fdl; French: La dernier papillon) is a 1990 Czech\u2013French holocaust drama film directed by Karel Kachy\u0148a based on the book The Last Butterfly by Canadian author Michael Jacot.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nTom Courtenay as Antoine Moreau\nBrigitte Fossey as V\u011bra\nIngrid Held as Mich\u00e8le\nFreddie Jones as Conductor Karl Rheinberg\nMilan K\u0148a\u017eko as Commandant Gruber\nJosef Kemr as Leo Stadler\nDrahom\u00edra Fialkov\u00e1 as Leo Stadler's wife\nPavel Bobek as Silberstein\nJosef Laufer as Petersen\nHana Hegerov\u00e1 as Singer\nLinda Jablonsk\u00e1 as Stella\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe movie had a premiere in Czechoslovakia in 1991.

This movie is joyful from beginning to end \u2013 a small treasure, but a real one.\"\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was made on location in the village of K\u0159e\u010dovice, with some scenes in Prague.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n1986 Montreal World Film Festival \u2013 won Special Jury Award and Prize of the Ecumenical Jury\n1987 Paris Film Festival \u2013 won Best Actor award\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of submissions to the 59th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\nList of Czechoslovak submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMy Sweet Little Village at IMDb\nMy Sweet Little Village at AllMovie\nNew York Times Review\nThe Nurses  (Czech: Sest\u0159i\u010dky) is a 1984 Czech comedy film directed by Karel Kachy\u0148a based on the novel by Adolf Branald.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nAlena Mihulov\u00e1 as Nurse Marie Sahulov\u00e1\nJi\u0159ina Jir\u00e1skov\u00e1 as Old Nurse\nOnd\u0159ej Vetch\u00fd as Horsekeeper Petr\nOld\u0159ich V\u00edzner as Ambulance driver Arno\u0161t\nFranti\u0161ek Hus\u00e1k as Physician\nJi\u0159\u00ed R\u016f\u017ei\u010dka as Gamekeeper Kr\u00e1kora\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Nurses at IMDb\nEduard Hedvicek (Czech: Eduard Hedv\u00ed\u010dek; 17 March 1878 in Kojet\u00edn \u2013 12 September 1949 in Vienna) was the secretary of Engelbert Dollfu\u00df, the Austrian Chancellor before the Anschluss. On 25 July 1934 he unsuccessfully tried to prevent Dollfu\u00df's assassination by Otto Planetta. He testified at the trial of the murderers as a \"Crown\" (prosecution) witness and was awarded the Gold Medal of Merit Signum Laudis by the Austrian government for his heroic efforts. He was imprisoned by the Nazis after Germany annexed Austria. His imprisonment was a matter of personal revenge for Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer and Chef der Reichssicherheitshauptamtes of the Nazi government and a famous Austrian Nazi, who himself was involved in Dollfu\u00df's assassination and was for this and other crimes hanged after the war.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nAssassination in Vienna, Walter B.
