Set in Glasgow, Scotland, it is her debut feature film and was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival.\nThe film won its director numerous awards including the Carl Foreman Award for Newcomer in British Film at the BAFTA Awards, the Sutherland Trophy at the London Film Festival and the Silver Hugo for Best Director at the Chicago International Film Festival. Ratcatcher grossed $888,817 worldwide. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray by The Criterion Collection.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nRatcatcher is set in Glasgow in 1973. The city, despite its Victorian grandeur, has some housing schemes that are among the poorest in western Europe. Many had no running hot water, bathing facilities, and indoor toilets. The city is midway through a major re-development program, demolishing these schemes and re-housing the tenants in new modern estates. Social problems are exacerbated by the binmen going on strike creating additional health hazards and a breeding ground for rats. The main character, James, is a 12-year-old boy, growing up in one of these housing schemes that is gradually emptying as tenants are re-housed in newer developments. Meanwhile all that those that remain can do is patiently wait to be re-housed like James and his family, (two sisters, one older, one younger, his mum and heavy-drinking father).\n\n\n== Plot ==\nJames's friend Ryan Quinn is being forced to put on his gum boots to go to visit his father who is in prison. But Ryan chooses to play with James instead, and runs off while his mother is not looking. Ryan meets James at the canal and drowns during some rough-house play. James bears much of the blame for not having raised the alarm, but he believes his inaction has gone unnoticed. Ryan's family are re-housed. On leaving day, Ryan's mother gives James the pair of brown sandals she'd bought for her son on the day of his death.\nSensitive James tries to come to terms with his guilt for the death of his friend while trying to make sense of the insensitive aspects of his environment. One day he takes a bus to the end of its route on the outskirts of Glasgow. He explores a new housing estate under construction. Standing in front of a kitchen window in a half-built house, he wonders in awe at the view: an expansive field of wheat, blowing in the wind and reaching to the horizon. James climbs through the window and escapes into the blissful freedom of the field.\nJames befriends a girl, Margaret Anne, whom he tries to help after her glasses are thrown into the canal by the local gang. James and Margaret Anne become friends and find comfort in each other's company. Both find some relief, James from his home environment and Margaret Anne from the local gang's abuse. One of James' friends, Kenny, receives a pet mouse as a birthday present. After the gang throw the mouse around in the air to make him \"fly\", Kenny ties the mouse's tail to a balloon, and the film shows it floating to the moon. Then, Kenny's mouse joins a whole colony of other mice frolicking on the moon. Kenny later falls in the canal and is rescued by James' father, who briefly becomes the local hero.\nThough the British Army eventually arrive to clean all the rubbish from the neighbourhood, James realises that his situation will most likely never change. He throws himself into the canal. A brief scene is shown of James and his family moving into a new neighbourhood.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nWilliam Eadie as James Gillespie\nTommy Flanagan as George Gillespie\nMandy Matthews as Anne Gillespie\nMichelle Stewart as Ellen Gillespie\nLynne Ramsay Jr. as Anne Marie Gillespie\nLeanne Mullen as Margaret Anne\nJohn Miller as Kenny\nThomas McTaggart as Ryan Quinn\nJackie Quinn as Mrs. Quinn\nJames Ramsay as Mr. Quinn\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRatcatcher received generally positive reviews from critics.

Unlike conventional plays, Shawn initially performed The Fever not in a theater, but in private homes by appointment.  Later, he performed the piece in a theater, but in keeping with the desire to be unconventional in presentation, Shawn eschewed theatrical lighting, sets, and theater programs, and mingled with the audience immediately before the play began.  In an interview with The Paris Review, Shawn explained that he used these novel approaches to avoid people dismissing the play's message as merely \"great theater.\"\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film follows the existential crisis of an unnamed urban sophisticate (Vanessa Redgrave) who becomes aware of the nature of world politics, economic exploitation and the vapid consumerism around her. A series of events lead her to visit an unnamed third world country, representing an exotic location somewhere in Eastern Europe, where the entire economy and populace are geared towards the tourist industry. Even as she enjoys the rare taste of its products she is made starkly aware of the reality behind the fa\u00e7ade by a journalist (Michael Moore) who, subsequently, suggests a visit to the country's war-torn neighbour in order to experience a true picture of life in the region. She does so and her life is changed forever.\nOnce back, and now acutely attuned to the world about her, she can no longer fit back into her old elitist and consumer-driven lifestyle; watching operas, discussing art and theatre with friends, shopping for \"beautiful things\" and aggrandizing her  trifling everyday struggles, all seem meaningless to her compared with her recent macro epiphany. Compared with the global struggle for existence, her life begins to feel insignificant. Having lived in the bubble her guilt-free, pleasure-filled life, she is now challenged to look beyond comfort and soon finds herself in the throes of a moral dilemma, questioning the moral consistency of her own life and the choices that have affected the lives of the poor in far corners of the globe. She feels that she cannot be truly free having apprehended this new reality, which confronts her blindness to  the harsh truths of the class struggle and her sense of entitlement, which had, in the past, been broken, only occasionally, by displays of sympathy.\nShe returns to the war-torn nation to explore her feelings further, this new reality now drawing her ever-deeper. This leads to a delirious bout of fever in a run-down hotel where her inner-self challenges her need for comfort and entitlement, culminating in a moment of spiritual awakening and a perceived 'oneness' with all reality. Finally she sees the truth about her own life and her innate connection with every human being, apprehending the transient nature of her material life. She can no longer sit, immersed in her personal comforts and vanity, or \"clean sheets\" as she terms it, and pretend it\u2019s all right when the world around her is filled with strife and exploitation for millions of people. She is lustrated of her previous immunity towards their predicament and is, by extension, finally able to see the truth of own life, as summarised by film's tag-line: Enlightenment Can Be Brutal.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nVanessa Redgrave - Woman\nAngelina Jolie - Revolutionary\nMichael Moore - Reporter\nJoely Richardson - Woman at 30\n\n\n== Production ==\nParts of the film was shot in Snowdonia and Penmon, Anglesey in North Wales to represent locations in Eastern Europe\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2005: Bratislava International Film Festival:\nBoxes (French: Les Boites) is a 2007 French film and the directorial debut of Jane Birkin. Birkin also stars alongside Geraldine Chaplin and Michel Piccoli. The film is based on  Birkin's own family life, chronicling three marriages and the three children she bore from these marriages.

The film premiered in the Un Certain Regard portion of the 2007 Cannes Film Festival on 21 May. It was released in France on 6 June 2007.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn Brittany, a middle-aged woman, Anna lives in a rambling home with her sometime dead father (Piccoli), her opinionated mother (Chaplin) and the memories of her three grown-up daughters. As Anna struggles with her mid-life crisis, the possessions and photographs in the home begin to spark her memories of childhood and earlier adulthood.\nIn particular the memories evoked are of her three husbands and the children she bore with them. Her first marriage to Fanny's English father (Hurt) failed and as a consequence, Fanny (R\u00e9gnier) barely knows him. Fanny's half-sister is Camille (Doillon), who Anna had with Camille's now dead father, Max (Benichou).

The film was shot in Birkin's own family home in Land\u00e9da. Birkin offered the main role of Anna to Chaplin, but Chaplin turned this down, feeling that as the role was written for a 45-year-old woman, she would be better suited to the role of Anna's mother.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nLe Figaro praised the \"worrying, unpredictable and touching sincerity\" of the film.

When he does not arrive, Tanya panics and claims political asylum, resulting in her and her son being confined to the small seaside town of Stonehaven while their claim is considered, a process she is told could take up to a year. Stonehaven, a former resort town, has been converted into a ''designated holding area'' for undocumented immigrants. Tanya and Artyom are placed in a shabby apartment building that overlooks an abandoned amusement park. The area is patrolled by officers who make sure that refugees don't escape. Tanya, who illustrated children's books in Russia, carries a framed illustration she made amongst her belongings.\nTanya is propositioned by Les, an Internet pornographer, to participate in webcam porn videos. Though Tanya is initially wary of the idea, she decides to take up Les' offer when she is desperate for money. As she dresses up in one of the costumes Les gives her and crawls onto the bed, she starts crying and cannot follow through with the video, ultimately leaving. She finds other ways of making money, such as donating blood. Using the holding area's one operating payphone, she is finally able to make contact with Mark, but he breaks up with her.\nTanya attempts to withdraw her claim for asylum and tells the council officers she wants to go back to Russia, but she is told the review of her petition could still take months. Alfie, a former boxer who manages the local amusement arcade, takes sympathy in Tanya's plight, helping her with using the phone line and bringing necessities for her and Artyom. Artyom bonds with Alfie and the two repaint the drab flat he shares with his mother. Though Tanya does not want to get her heart broken again, she enters into a relationship with Alfie. Alfie reveals how he came to end up in Stonehaven; after doing prison time for a fight he got into, he felt he had nothing else to go back to, saying the town is full of \"fuckups\" like him. Tanya gets choked up when she admits that she's been married and divorced twice previously, crying that it is bad for her and Artyom, but Alfie comforts her. Artyom soon falls in with a group of tough kids who drink, smoke, and engage in petty theft. One day, Les goes to see Tanya at her flat and pays her for the first video attempt, promising more money if she returns and completes the video. Alfie hears through the door and inquires about what business Les is seeking with Tanya, but she denies any involvement.\nLater, Alfie angrily walks into Les' home and interrupts a webcam video he is filming, destroying his camera and the furniture. Alfie comes to get Tanya and Artyom, saying he is going to get them out of Stonehaven. The three of them hide in a small, abandoned sailboat on the beach; when the water rises, they sail away and manage to evade the security guards. Alfie, as well as Artyom, want Tanya to stay in England, but she reasons she has to go back to start a new life. Alfie finds a truck for Tanya and Artyom that will take them to the airport. After embracing, Tanya and Alfie say they'll remember each other. Tanya leaves Alfie with the framed illustration as a gift.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nMargate, in the Thanet District of Kent, doubled as the fictional seaside town of Stonehaven, and\nRade \u0160erbed\u017eija (Serbian Cyrillic: \u0420\u0430\u0434\u0435 \u0428\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0435\u045f\u0438\u0458\u0430, pronounced [r\u01ce\u02d0de \u0283erb\u011bd\u0292ija]; born 27 July 1946) is a Croatian actor, director and musician.

The film follows a preteen girl living in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime who disguises herself as a boy, Osama, to support her family. It was the first film to be shot entirely in Afghanistan since 1996, when the Taliban regime banned the creation of all films. As of 2018, the film was the highest-grossing Afghan film of all time. The film is an international co-production between companies in Afghanistan, the Netherlands, Japan, Ireland, and Iran.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nAlthough the title of the film highlights an allegorical relevance to Osama bin Laden, there is no further similarity. The film takes place during the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, which is especially repressive for women.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\nIn Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, women must wear all-enveloping burqas to cover themselves and are banned from working outside the home. This causes difficulty for a family consisting of only an unnamed young girl, her mother, and her grandmother, whose male relatives have been killed in battle during the Soviet invasion and subsequent civil wars. The mother loses her hospital job when the Taliban cuts off funding, and cannot find other work.\nDesperate, the mother and grandmother decide to have the young girl disguise herself as a boy so that she can get a job. To persuade the girl to accept the plan, the grandmother tells her an Afghan fable about a boy who became a girl when he went under a rainbow. The girl reluctantly agrees, despite being afraid that the Taliban will kill her if they discover her masquerade. They cut her hair, and the girl plants a lock of it in a flowerpot. The only other people who know of the ruse are the milk vendor, who gives her a job because he was a friend of her deceased father, and a local boy named Espandi who sees through her disguise. It is Espandi who renames the girl Osama.\nThe masquerade becomes more difficult when the Taliban draft all the local boys into their madrasa, a religious and military training school for boys. They are taught how to fight and conduct ghusl, ritual ablutions, including one for when they experience a nocturnal emission or, when they are older, have sex with their wives. Osama attempts to avoid joining the ablution session, and the schoolmaster grows suspicious of her. She realises that she will inevitably be found out. Several of the boys begin to pick on her. Espandi is able to protect her at first, but her secret is discovered when she begins to menstruate.\nOsama is arrested and put on trial along with two other people. The others are condemned and put to death, but as Osama is destitute and helpless, her life is spared; she is instead given in marriage to a much older man. He already has three wives, all of whom hate him and say he has destroyed their lives. The wives take pity on Osama, but are powerless to help her. The husband shows her the padlocks he uses on his wives' rooms, reserving the largest for her. The film ends with the new husband leading Osama to a room, then him conducting an ablution in an outdoor bath, which the boys were earlier taught to conduct after ejaculation.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nMarina Golbahari \u2013 Osama\nArif Herati \u2013 Espandi\nZubaida Sahar \u2013 Mom\nMalik Akhlaqi \u2013 Sun osama\nGol Rahman Ghorbandi \u2013 Lady No. 1\nMohamad Haref Harat \u2013 Lady No. 2\nMohamad Nader Khadjeh \u2013 Lady No. 3\nKhwaja Nader \u2013 Jadi\nHamida Refah \u2013 Rohmi\n\n\n== Production ==\nSiddiq Barmak's inspiration was found in a news story he read while in Peshawar, Pakistan. The paper told the story of a girl who had dressed as a boy to attend school but was eventually discovered by the Taliban. Barmak would go on to add elements of other stories that were shared with him by people who had lived in Afghanistan under Taliban rule culminating with the story of the film.\nThe film was shot on location in Kabul. Work began in June 2002 and was completed in March 2003 with a budget of approximately $46,000.
