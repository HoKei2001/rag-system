        "content": "New York City, the most populous city in the United States, is home to more than 7,000 completed high-rise buildings of at least 115 feet (35 m), of which at least 102 are taller than 650 feet (198 m). The tallest building in New York is One World Trade Center, which rises 1,776 feet (541 m). The 104-story skyscraper also stands as the tallest building in the United States, the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, and the seventh-tallest building in the world. At 1,550 feet (472 m), Central Park Tower is the second-tallest completed building in the city. It has the highest roof of any building outside Asia, and is the tallest residential building in the world. The third-tallest completed building in the city is 111 West 57th Street. Rising to 1,428 feet (435 m), it is the world's most slender skyscraper. The fourth-tallest is One Vanderbilt. At 1,401 feet (427 m), it is the tallest office building in Midtown. The fifth-tallest is 432 Park Avenue at 1,397 feet (426 m).\nAt 1,250 feet (381 m), the 102-story Empire State Building in Midtown Manhattan, which was finished in 1931, stood as the tallest building in the world from its completion until 1970, when construction on the 1,368-foot (417 m) North Tower of the original World Trade Center surpassed it. It is the tenth-tallest building in the United States, and rises to a pinnacle of 1,454 feet (443 m) including its antenna. The North Tower (the original One World Trade Center), along with its twin the South Tower (the first Two World Trade Center), which was six feet shorter, held this title only briefly as they were both surpassed by construction of the 110-story Willis Tower in Chicago in 1973. The Twin Towers remained the tallest buildings in New York City until they were destroyed in 2001 during the September 11 attacks, leaving the Empire State Building again as the city's tallest building.\nThe new One World Trade Center began construction in 2006; in April 2012 it surpassed the Empire State Building to become the city's tallest. Upon its topping out in May 2013, the 1,776-foot (541 m) One World Trade Center surpassed the Willis Tower to become the tallest building in the United States and the Western Hemisphere. One World Trade Center is part of the redevelopment of the World Trade Center, which also includes the 1,079-foot (329 m) 3 World Trade Center, the 977-foot (298 m) 4 World Trade Center, the 743-foot (226 m) 7 World Trade Center, the approved 900-foot (274 m) 5 World Trade Center, and one partly constructed on-hold building: the 1,350-foot (411 m) 2 World Trade Center.\nThe majority of skyscrapers in New York City are concentrated in Midtown and Downtown Manhattan, although other neighborhoods of Manhattan and the boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx also contain some high-rises.\nAs of March 2024, there were 317 completed skyscrapers that rose at least 492 feet (150 m) in height, more than any other city in the Western Hemisphere, and third most in the world exceeded only by Hong Kong and Shenzhen.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of skyscrapers in New York City began with the construction of the Equitable Life, Western Union, and Tribune buildings in the early 1870s. These relatively short early skyscrapers, sometimes referred to as \"preskyscrapers\" or \"protoskyscrapers\", included features such as a steel frame and elevators—then-new innovations that were used in the city's later skyscrapers.: 62  Modern skyscraper construction began with the completion of the World Building in 1890; the structure rose to a pinnacle of 349 feet (106 m). Though not the city's first high-rise, it was the first building to surpass the 284-foot (87 m) spire of Trinity Church. The World Building, which stood as the tallest in the city until 1899, was demolished in 1955 to allow for the construction of an expanded entrance to the Brooklyn Bridge. The Park Row Building, at 391 feet (119 m), was the city's tallest building from 1899 to 1908, and the world's tallest office buildin\nThis list of tallest buildings in Rochester ranks high-rise buildings in the U.S. city of Rochester, New York by height. The tallest building in the city is Innovation Square, formerly known as the Xerox Tower, which rises 443 feet (135 m) and was completed in 1968.\n\n\n== Tallest buildings ==\nThis lists ranks Rochester skyscrapers that stand at least 200 feet (61 m) tall, based on standard height measurement. This includes spires and architectural details but does not include antenna masts. Existing structures are included for ranking purposes based on present height.\n\n\n== Tallest proposed, approved, under construction, and/or cancelled ==\nThis lists buildings that are under construction, approved for construction or proposed for construction in Rochester and are planned to rise at least 250 feet (76 m), but are not yet completed structures. Under construction buildings that have already been topped out are also included.\nThe demolition of Midtown Plaza was completed in 2011. Paetec was bought by Windstream and they housed their regional offices in a renovated 3 story portion of the former Seneca Building, rather than build a new tower. \n\n\n== Timeline of tallest buildings ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\nA. ^ New York has 206 existing and under construction buildings over 500 feet (152 m), Chicago has 107, Miami has 37, Houston has 30, Los Angeles has 22, Dallas has 19, Atlanta has 19, San Francisco has 18, Las Vegas has 17, Boston has 16, Seattle has 14, Philadelphia has 10, Pittsburgh has 10, Jersey City has 9, Minneapolis has 9, Denver has 8, Detroit has 7, Charlotte has 6 and Columbus has 5.

The tallest building in New York State is the 104-story One World Trade Center, which was completed in 2014 and rises to 1,776 feet (541 m) in Lower Manhattan, New York City. New York City, the largest city in the United States, is home to the vast majority of the skyscrapers in New York; outside the city, most of the state's skyscrapers are concentrated in Albany, Buffalo and Rochester. The tallest building in Upstate New York is the 44-story Erastus Corning Tower, which rises 589 feet (180 m) in Albany, the state's capital city. Although the building is the tallest in the upstate region by a significant margin, it does not appear in the 100-tallest buildings in New York state when New York City skyscrapers are included in the ranking.\n\n\n== Tallest buildings ==\n\nThis list ranks completed skyscrapers in Upstate New York that stand at least 290 feet (88 m) tall, based on standard height measurement. This includes spires and architectural details but does not include antenna masts. An equal sign (=) following a rank indicates the same height between two or more buildings. The \"Year\" column indicates the year in which a building was completed.\n\n\n== Timeline of tallest buildings ==\nThis section lists buildings that once held the title of tallest building in Upstate New York. Saint Paul's Episcopal Cathedral held the title twice, both before the construction and after the demolition of the original Electric Tower, which was designed as a temporary building that would only last the length of the Pan-American Exposition.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n=== List of tallest buildings by city ===\nList of tallest buildings in New York City\nList of tallest buildings in Brooklyn\nList of tallest buildings in Queens\nList of tallest buildings in Albany, New York\nList of tallest buildings in Buffalo, New York\nList of tallest buildings in Rochester, New York\nList of tallest buildings in Syracuse, New York\n\n\n== References ==\nThe world's first skyscraper was built in Chicago in 1885. Since then, the United States has been home to some of the world's tallest skyscrapers. New York City, and especially the borough of Manhattan, has the tallest skyline in the country. Eleven American buildings have held the title of tallest building in the world. New York City and Chicago have been the centers of American skyscraper building. The 10-story Home Insurance Building, built in Chicago in 1885, is regarded as the world's first skyscraper; the building was constructed using a novel steel-loadbearing frame which became a standard of the industry worldwide.\nSince its topping out in 2013, One World Trade Center in New York City has been the tallest skyscraper in the United States. Its spire brings the structure to a symbolic architectural height of 1,776 feet (541 m), connoting the year the Declaration of Independence was signed, though the absolute tip (or pinnacle) of the structure is measured at 1,792 ft (546 m). However, the observation deck elevation and the height to the highest occupied floor of One World Trade Center are surpassed by Central Park Tower, 432 Park Avenue, 111 West 57th Street, and Chicago's Willis Tower, which was formerly and is still commonly known as Sears Tower. Tribune East Tower in Chicago will also have a higher occupied floor and roof upon its completion.\nPrior to the September 11 attacks in New York City, the twin towers of the first World Trade Center occupied the second and third positions on the list below. The North Tower (1 WTC) stood at 1,368 feet (417 m), while the South Tower (2 WTC) was 1,362 feet (415 m) tall, then surpassed only by the Willis Tower at 1,450 feet (442 m). If they were still standing today, they would occupy the seventh and eighth positions on the list below, with their replacement—the new One World Trade Center—being excluded.\nThere are numerous skyscrapers and supertall buildings both proposed and under construction throughout the country, concentrated in Chicago and New York City. 270 Park Avenue, in New York City, is currently under construction. In Chicago, work for Tribune East Tower has not begun but tentatively planned to start in February 2024. Other tall buildings that are proposed include the 1,907-foot-tall (581 m) Legends Tower in Oklahoma City, the 1,010-foot-tall (310 m) One Bayfront Plaza, and the 1,049-foot-tall (320 m) One Brickell Centre in Miami.\n\n\n== Tallest buildings ==\nThis list ranks completed and topped-out buildings in the United States that stand at least 800 feet (244 m) tall, based on standard height measurement which includes spires and architectural details, but excludes antenna masts.

The tallest building in the city is the 44-story Erastus Corning Tower, which is 610 ft (186 m) tall. Completed in 1973, it is the tallest building in New York state outside New York City. The second-tallest building is the Alfred E. Smith State Office Building, which stands 387 ft (118 m). Four buildings tie for third-tallest in Albany at 310 ft (94 m), all of which belong to the Empire State Plaza.\n\n\n== Tallest buildings ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of tallest buildings in Upstate New York\n\n\n== References ==\nThis list of tallest buildings in Jersey City ranks skyscrapers and high-rises in the U.S. city of Jersey City, New Jersey by height. The tallest building in Jersey City is the 79-story 99 Hudson Street, which topped out at 900 feet (274 m) in September 2018. It is currently the tallest building in New Jersey and 51st-tallest building in the United States. The 42-story 30 Hudson Street, known widely as the \"Goldman Sachs Tower\", which rises 781 feet (238 m) and was completed in 2004, is the second-tallest building in New Jersey and 99th-tallest building in the United States. The third-tallest skyscraper in Jersey City is the 70-story Journal Squared Tower 2 at 754 feet (230 m). Nine of the ten tallest buildings in New Jersey are located in Jersey City. Jersey City has the 10th-largest skyline in the United States.\nThe history of skyscrapers in Jersey City began with the 1928 completion of Labor Bank Building, which is often regarded as the first skyscraper in the city; it rises 15 floors and 179 feet (55 m) in height. The building, now known as \"26 Journal Square\", was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Jersey City went through a relatively small building boom in the late 1980s and early 1990s and then entered a larger period of commercial and residential high-rise construction in the late 1990s. This second boom has resulted in the construction of many of the city's tallest buildings, including 30 Hudson Street and the Harborside Financial Center development. The construction boom has continued to the present. Since 2002, the city has seen consistent growth in the number of new buildings that are 410 feet (125 m) or higher. As of February 2022, there are 122 completed high-rises in the city. Thirty completed buildings stand at least 410 feet (125 m) in height.\nIn addition, Jersey City's skyline is ranked (based on completed buildings over 492 feet (150 m) tall as of September 2024) first in New Jersey with 19 buildings, third in the Northeast (after New York City, and Boston), 10th in the United States, 13th in North America, and 82nd in the world.[A]\n\n\n== Tallest buildings ==\nThis list ranks Jersey City skyscrapers that stand at least 410 feet (125 m) tall, based on standard height measurement.

The tallest building in New Jersey is the 79-story 99 Hudson Street in Jersey City, which topped out at 900 feet (274 m) in September 2018. It is the 51st-tallest building in the United States, as well as the 15th tallest residential building in the United States. The 42-story 30 Hudson Street, known widely as the Goldman Sachs Tower, which rises 781 feet (238 m) at Exchange Place in Jersey City is the state's tallest commercial building. It is also the 97th-tallest building in the United States. The tallest building in New Jersey outside Jersey City is the 57-story Ocean Resort Casino, which rises 709 feet (216 m) in Atlantic City and ranks as the second-tallest casino tower in the United States.\nThe vast majority of skyscrapers and high-rises in New Jersey are concentrated in Jersey City, Newark, Atlantic City, Fort Lee, and North Hudson. Amongst New Jersey cities, Jersey City has the most buildings exceeding 330 feet (100 m) in height at 36 buildings, followed by Atlantic City with 11 buildings, Newark with 9 buildings, and Fort Lee with 7 buildings. \nThe first skyscraper in New Jersey was the Firemen's Insurance Building, built in 1910 in Newark. The first skyscraper boom in New Jersey largely began in the 1920s and 1930s, largely concentrated in Newark, with construction of various iconic buildings such as the National Newark Building and the Military Park Building. Newark had a small high-rise building boom in the 1960s to 1970s, followed by decades of little construction. Although Jersey City's first skyscraper, the Labor Bank Building, was built in 1928, the city did not have much of a skyline presence until a small building boom in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the 2000s, Jersey City's building boom truly kicked off. Jersey City and Newark have experienced large building booms in the 2010s, particularly toward the end of the decade, both of which have continued into the present. Atlantic City had two distinct building booms, first in the 1980s and again in the 2000s, largely the construction of casino buildings.\n\n\n== Tallest buildings ==\nThis list ranks New Jersey skyscrapers that stand at least 330 feet (100 m) tall, based on standard height measurement.

The tallest building in Buffalo is currently the Seneca One Tower, which stands 529 feet (161 m) tall. As of 2017, Buffalo has 17 structures taller than 250 ft (76 m).\nBuffalo has a rich tradition for architecture. Among the first true skyscrapers built in the city were the Prudential (Guaranty) Building and the Ellicott Square Building, both being built in the 1890s. A number of the tallest municipal buildings in the country were also built in the city, such as Buffalo City Hall, which continues to dominate the skyline. The city is also home to a large collection of large grain elevators, many of which rise above 150 ft (46 m). Construction of high rise buildings has increased in recent years after decades of relative dormancy, in addition to the retro-fitting of many old structures.\n\n\n== Tallest buildings ==\nThis lists ranks Buffalo buildings that stand at least 128 feet (39 m) tall, based on standard height measurement.

Tall buildings, such as skyscrapers, are intended here as enclosed structures with continuously occupiable floors and a height of at least 350 metres (1,150 ft). Such definition excludes non-building structures, such as towers.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHistorically, the world's tallest man-made structure was the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, which held the position for over 3800 years until the construction of Lincoln Cathedral in 1311. The Strasbourg Cathedral in France, completed in 1439, was the world's tallest building until 1874.\n\n  \nThe first building considered to be a skyscraper was the 138 ft (42.1 m) Home Insurance Building, built in Chicago in 1885. The United States would remain the location of the world's tallest building throughout the 20th century until 1998, when the Petronas Towers were completed. Since then, two other buildings have gained the title: Taipei 101 in 2004 and Burj Khalifa in 2010. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the Middle East, China, and Southeast Asia have experienced booms in skyscraper construction.\n\n\n== Ranking criteria and alternatives ==\nThe international non-profit organization Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) was formed in 1969 and announces the title of \"The World's Tallest Building\" and sets the standards by which buildings are measured. It maintains a list of the 100 tallest completed buildings in the world. The organization currently ranks Burj Khalifa in Dubai as the tallest at 828 m (2,717 ft). However, the CTBUH only recognizes buildings that are complete, and some buildings included within the lists in this article are not considered finished by the CTBUH.\nIn 1996, as a response to the dispute as to whether the Petronas Towers or the Sears Tower was taller, the council listed and ranked buildings in four categories:\n\nheight to structural or architectural top;\nheight to floor of highest occupied floor;\nheight to top of roof (removed as category in November 2009); and\nheight to top of any part of the building.\nAll categories measure the building from the level of the lowest significant open-air pedestrian entrance.\nSpires are considered integral parts of the architectural design of buildings, changes to which would substantially change the appearance and design of the building, whereas antennas may be added or removed without such consequences. The Petronas Towers, with their spires, are thus ranked higher than the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) with its antennas, despite the Petronas Towers' lower roofs and lower highest point.\nUntil 1996, the world's tallest building was defined by the height to the top of the tallest architectural element, including spires but not antennae. In 1930, this definitional argument led to a rivalry between the Bank of Manhattan Building and the Chrysler Building. The Bank of Manhattan Building (i.e. 40 Wall Street) employed only a short spire, was 282.5 m (927 ft) tall, and had a much higher top occupied floor (the second category in the 1996 criteria for tallest building). In contrast, the Chrysler Building employed a very large 38.1 m (125 ft) spire secretly assembled inside the building to claim the title of world's tallest building with a total height of 318.9 m (1,046 ft), although it had a lower top occupied floor and a shorter height when both buildings' spires were excluded.\nUpset by Chrysler's victory, Shreve & Lamb, the consulting architects of the Bank of Manhattan Building, wrote a newspaper article claiming that their building was actually the tallest, since it contained the world's highest usable floor, at 255 m (837 ft). They pointed out that the observation deck in the Bank of Manhattan Building was nearly 30 m (98 ft) above the top floor in the Chrysler Building, whose surpassing spire was strictly ornamental and inaccessible.\nThe Burj Khalifa currently tops the list regardless of which criterion is applied, though at a much lower margin when measured to highest\nLists of tallest buildings in New York include:\n\nList of tallest buildings in New York City\nList of tallest buildings in Brooklyn\nList of tallest buildings in Queens\nList of tallest buildings in Upstate New York\nList of tallest buildings in Albany, New York\nList of tallest buildings in Buffalo, New York\nList of tallest buildings in Rochester, New York\nList of tallest buildings in Syracuse, New York\nList of tallest buildings on Long Island\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of tallest buildings in the United States\nThis list of the tallest buildings in North America ranks skyscrapers in order by height. The United States is considered the birthplace of the skyscraper, with the world's first skyscraper, the Home Insurance Building, built in Chicago in 1885. Since then, the United States has been home to some of the world's tallest skyscrapers, with the tallest in New York City and Chicago. Eleven buildings in North America have held the title of tallest building in the world, with 9 in New York City. Canada and Mexico have also seen areas of skyscraper building, especially in Toronto, Calgary, Mexico City and Monterrey. Additionally, Panama City has emerged as a hotbed of skyscraper building activity and currently lists a total of 49 buildings over 150 meters in height.\n\n\n== List ==\nThis list ranks completed and topped-out buildings in North America that stand at least 235 meters (771 ft.) tall, based on standard height measurement which includes spires and architectural details.

At 811 feet (247 m), The Orchard, a residential skyscraper in Long Island City, is the tallest building in Queens, and the second tallest building in New York City outside of Manhattan. It surpassed the nearby 763-foot (233 m) Skyline Tower, which was Queens' tallest building from 2021 to 2024, and remains the tallest residential building in the borough.\nThe skyscraper came to Queens in 1927 with the construction of the Bank of the Manhattan Company Building. It remained the tallest building in the borough until the completion of the Kennedy House in 1964, and the tallest office building in the borough until 1990. Queens has recently undergone a high-rise construction boom, with the majority of the borough's tallest completed since 2010.

The building gained the official title of \"tallest building in the world\" and the tallest self-supported structure at its opening on January 9, 2010. The second-tallest structure in the world is the 679-metre-tall (2,227 ft) Merdeka 118 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, while the third-tallest self-supporting structure and the tallest tower in the world is the Tokyo Skytree (634 m or 2,080 ft). The tallest guyed structure is the KRDK-TV mast in North Dakota, U.S. at 630 metres (2,060 ft).\nThe Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, an organization that certifies buildings as the \"World's Tallest\", recognizes a building only if at least 50% of its height is made up of floor plates containing habitable floor area. Structures that do not meet this criterion, such as the CN Tower, are defined as \"towers\".\nThere are dozens of radio and television broadcasting towers which measure over 600 metres (about 2,000 ft) in height, and only the tallest are recorded in publicly available information sources.\n\n\n== Debate over definition ==\nThe assessment of the height of artificial structures has been controversial. Because varying standards have been used by different organizations, the accepted height of these structures or buildings depends on which standards are accepted. The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat has changed its definitions over time. Some of the controversy regarding the definitions and assessment of tall structures and buildings has included the following:\n\nthe definition of a structure, a building and a tower\nwhether a structure, building or tower under construction should be included in any assessment\nwhether a structure, building or tower has to be officially opened before it is assessed\nwhether structures built in and rising above water should have their below-water height included in any assessment.\nwhether a structure, building or tower that is guyed is assessed in the same category as self-supporting structures.\nWithin an accepted definition of a building further controversy has included the following factors:\n\nwhether only habitable height of the building is considered\nwhether communication towers with observation galleries should be considered \"habitable\" in this sense\nwhether rooftop antennas, viewing platforms or any other architecture that does not form a habitable floor should be included in the assessment\nwhether a floor built at a high level of a telecommunications or viewing tower should change the tower's definition to that of a \"building\"\n\n\n== Tallest structures ==\n\nThis category does not require the structure to be \"officially\" open, but does require it to be \"topped out\".\nThe tallest artificial structure is Burj Khalifa, a skyscraper in Dubai that reached 829.8 m (2,722 ft) in height on January 17, 2009. By April 8, 2008 it had been built higher than the KVLY-TV mast in North Dakota, US. That September it officially surpassed Poland's 646.38 m (2,120.7 ft) Warsaw radio mast, which stood from 1974 to 1991, to become the tallest structure ever built. Guyed lattice towers such as these masts had held the world height record since 1954. \nThe Petronius Platform stands 610 m (2,000 ft) off the sea floor, leading some, including Guinness World Records 2007, to claim it as the tallest freestanding structure in the world, until surpassed by the Burj Khalifa in 2010. However, it is debated whether underwater height should be counted, in the same manner as height below ground is ignored on buildings. The Troll A platform is 472 m (1,549 ft), without any part of that height being supported by wires. The tension-leg type of oil platform has even greater below-water heights with several examples more than 1,000 m (3,300 ft) deep. However, these platforms are not considered constant structures as the vast majority of their height is made up of the length of the tendons attaching the floating pl\nThis list ranks buildings in the U.S. city of Syracuse, New York, by height.\nSince its construction in 1927, the State Tower Building has been the tallest building in Syracuse.\nBricks on the facade of the State Tower Building gradually get lighter towards the top of the Art Deco building; this was intended to make the building seem higher than it actually is. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing property in the Hanover Square Historic District. It was renovated in 2003 and 2016.\nSt. Paul's Episcopal Cathedral, one of the top 10, was constructed in the 1800s.\nEight tall buildings were constructed in the 1970s, and apparently demand for office space has not required new buildings since.   \n\n\n== Cancelled buildings ==\nProposed construction of the \"Primex Building\" never got past foundation work being done, in a project planned to be completed in 1964.  It was to have a revolving restaurant, and, at 25 stories, would have been the tallest building in New York State outside of New York City.\nOn October 24, 2002, the groundbreaking for a 430-foot (130 m), 47-story Destiny USA Hotel to be named the Grand Destiny Hotel was held. On that date a steel beam was driven into the Carousel Center parking lot. Over the next three weeks, over 40 more pilings were driven, but by December 2 construction had stopped. In July 2008 construction had restarted, and by August three stories of steel framework had been erected.\nOnCenter Convention Center Marriott Hotel was a planned 12- or 16-floor building, 58.28 metres (191.2 ft)] in 2004 and eventually cancelled.\nIn 2001 Clinton Square North Tower was a planned 16-floor, 74.49-metre (244.4 ft) complex built alongside Chase Tower and eventually cancelled.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Syracuse University buildings\nList of tallest buildings in Upstate New York\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBeauchamp, William Martin (1908).

Clarke Publishing Company.\nThe building form most closely associated with New York City is the skyscraper, which has shifted many commercial and residential districts from low-rise to high-rise. Surrounded mostly by water, the city has amassed one of the largest and most varied collection of skyscrapers in the world.\nNew York has architecturally significant buildings in a wide range of styles spanning distinct historical and cultural periods. These include the Woolworth Building (1913), an early Gothic revival skyscraper with large-scale gothic architectural detail. The 1916 Zoning Resolution required setback in new buildings, and restricted towers to a percentage of the lot size, to allow sunlight to reach the streets below. The Art Deco design of the Chrysler Building (1930) and Empire State Building (1931), with their tapered tops and steel spires, reflected the zoning requirements. The Chrysler Building is considered by many historians and architects to be one of New York's finest, with its distinctive ornamentation such as V-shaped lighting inserts capped by a steel spire at the tower's crown. Early influential examples of the International Style in the United States are 330 West 42nd Street (1931) and the Seagram Building (1958). The Condé Nast Building (2000) is an important example of green design in American skyscrapers.\nThe character of New York's large residential districts is often defined by the elegant brownstone rowhouses, townhouses, and tenements that were built during a period of rapid expansion from 1870 to 1930. In contrast, New York City also has neighborhoods that are less densely populated and feature free-standing dwellings. In the outer boroughs, large single-family homes are common in various architectural styles such as Tudor Revival and Victorian. Split two-family homes are also widely available across the outer boroughs, for example in the Flushing area.\nStone and brick became the city's building materials of choice after the construction of wood-frame houses was limited in the aftermath of the Great Fire of 1835. Unlike Paris, which for centuries was built from its own limestone bedrock, New York has always drawn its building stone from a far-flung network of quarries and its stone buildings have a variety of textures and hues. A distinctive feature of many of the city's buildings is the presence of wooden roof-mounted water towers. In the 19th century, the city required their installation on buildings higher than six stories to prevent the need for excessively high water pressures at lower elevations, which could burst municipal water pipes. Garden apartments became popular during the 1920s in outlying areas, including Jackson Heights in Queens, which became more accessible with expansion of the subway.\n\n\n== Concentrations of buildings ==\n\nNew York has two main concentrations of high-rise buildings: Midtown Manhattan and Lower Manhattan, each with its own uniquely recognizable skyline. Midtown Manhattan, the largest central business district in the world, is home to such notable buildings as the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, and Citigroup Center, as well as the Rockefeller Center complex. Lower Manhattan comprises the third largest central business district in the United States (after Midtown and Chicago's Loop). Lower Manhattan was characterized by the omnipresence of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center from its completion in 1973 until its destruction in the September 11 attacks in 2001.\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, Lower Manhattan saw reconstruction, which included One World Trade Center within the new World Trade Center complex. The Downtown skyline received new designs from such architects as Santiago Calatrava and Frank Gehry. In 2010, a 749-foot (228 m), 43-story tower named 200 West Street was built for Goldman Sachs across the street from the World Trade Center site.\nNew York City has a long history of tall buildings. It has been home to 10 buildings that have held the world's tal\nThe Chrysler Building is an Art Deco skyscraper on the East Side of Manhattan in New York City, at the intersection of 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. At 1,046 ft (319 m), it is the tallest brick building in the world with a steel framework. It was both the world's first supertall skyscraper and the world's tallest building for 11 months after its completion in 1930. As of 2019, the Chrysler is the 12th-tallest building in the city, tied with The New York Times Building.\nOriginally a project of real estate developer and former New York State Senator William H. Reynolds, the building was commissioned by Walter Chrysler, the head of the Chrysler Corporation. The construction of the Chrysler Building, an early skyscraper, was characterized by a competition with 40 Wall Street and the Empire State Building to become the world's tallest building. The Chrysler Building was designed and funded by Walter Chrysler personally as a real estate investment for his children, but it was not intended as the Chrysler Corporation's headquarters. An annex was completed in 1952, and the building was sold by the Chrysler family the next year, with numerous subsequent owners.\nWhen the Chrysler Building opened, there were mixed reviews of the building's design, some calling it inane and unoriginal, others hailing it as modernist and iconic. Reviewers in the late 20th and early 21st centuries regarded the building as a paragon of the Art Deco architectural style. In 2007, it was ranked ninth on the American Institute of Architects' list of America's Favorite Architecture. The facade and interior became New York City designated landmarks in 1978, and the structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark in 1976.\n\n\n== Site ==\nThe Chrysler Building is on the eastern side of Lexington Avenue between 42nd and 43rd streets in Midtown Manhattan in New York City. The land was donated to The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in 1902. The site is roughly a trapezoid with a 201-foot-long (61 m) frontage on Lexington Avenue; a 167-foot-long (51 m) frontage on 42nd Street; and a 205-foot-long (62 m) frontage on 43rd Street. The site bordered the old Boston Post Road, which predated, and ran aslant of, the Manhattan street grid established by the Commissioners' Plan of 1811. As a result, the east side of the building's base is similarly aslant. The building is assigned its own ZIP Code, 10174. It is one of 41 buildings in Manhattan that have their own ZIP Codes, as of 2019.\nThe Grand Hyatt New York hotel and the Graybar Building are across Lexington Avenue, while the Socony–Mobil Building is across 42nd Street. In addition, the Chanin Building is to the southwest, diagonally across Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe Chrysler Building was designed by William Van Alen in the Art Deco style and is named after one of its original tenants, automotive executive Walter Chrysler. With a height of 1,046 feet (319 m), the Chrysler is the 12th-tallest building in the city as of 2019, tied with The New York Times Building. The building is constructed of a steel frame infilled with masonry, with areas of decorative metal cladding. The structure contains 3,862 exterior windows. Approximately fifty metal ornaments protrude at the building's corners on five floors reminiscent of gargoyles on Gothic cathedrals. The 31st-floor contains gargoyles as well as replicas of the 1929 Chrysler radiator caps, and the 61st-floor is adorned with eagles as a nod to America's national bird.\nThe design of the Chrysler Building makes extensive use of bright \"Nirosta\" stainless steel, an austenitic alloy developed in Germany by Krupp. It was the first use of this \"18-8 stainless steel\" in an American project, composed of 18% chromium and 8% nickel. Nirosta was used in the exterior ornaments, the window frames, the crown, and the needle. The steel was an integral part of Van Alen's design,\nThis list of tallest church buildings ranks church buildings by height. From the Middle Ages until the advent of the skyscraper, Christian church buildings were often the world's tallest buildings. From 1311, when the spire of Lincoln Cathedral surpassed the height of the Great Pyramid of Giza, until the Washington Monument was completed in 1884, a succession of church buildings held this title.\n\nThe tallest church building in the world is the Ulm Minster (161.5 m), the main Lutheran congregation in Ulm, Germany.\nThe tallest Catholic, as well as the tallest domed church building, is the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace (158 m) in Yamoussoukro, Ivory Coast.\nThe tallest church building with two steeples as well as the tallest cathedral is Cologne Cathedral (157.4 m) in Cologne, Germany.\nThe tallest Eastern Orthodox, as well as the tallest domed cathedral, will be People's Salvation Cathedral (now 120 m; 127 m when completed) in Bucharest, Romania.\nThe tallest brickwork church building is St Martin's Church (130.6 m) in Landshut, Germany.\nThe tallest brickwork church building with two steeples is St Mary's Church (125 m) in Lübeck, Germany.\nThe tallest wooden church building is Săpânța-Peri Monastery church (78 m) in Săpânța, Romania.\nThe tallest church building in the Americas is the Cathedral of Maringá (124 m) in Maringá, Brazil.\nIf completed, the Sagrada Família in Barcelona, Spain, will be the tallest church building in the world, at 172.5 metres (566 ft).\nThe cities with the most churches surpassing 99 metres (325 feet) are Hamburg (5 of the 29 tallest churches, with 5 towers overall), Lübeck (4 of the 56 tallest churches, two of which with twin towers → 6 towers overall), Vienna (2), Tallinn (2), St. Petersburg (2), New York City (2), Dortmund (2) and Stralsund (2).\nThe cities with the most churches surpassing 75 metres (246 feet) are Berlin (16), Hamburg (9), Paris (8), Dresden (8), Vienna (7), Stockholm (7) and Munich (7), while in the Americas it is New York City (4).\n\n\n== Constructed ==\n\n\n=== Church buildings ≥ 99 m (325 ft) ===\nThis list does not include church buildings that incorporate a significant portion of space to non-church uses, such as the Chicago Temple Building.

The Brooklyn Tower, a condominium and rental tower in the Downtown neighborhood of the borough, is Brooklyn's tallest building at 1,066 feet (325 m) following its topping out in October 2021. The Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower in Fort Greene, at 512 feet (156 m), was the tallest building in Brooklyn for 80 years from its completion in 1929 until 2009, when The Brooklyner was topped out at 514 feet (157 m).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe construction of high-rise buildings in Brooklyn began during the late 19th century, following the completion of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1883 and the building of elevated railroads and streetcar lines during the late 1880s. Increased accessibility to Downtown Brooklyn brought greater economic growth and propagated denser commercial development, which increased the heights of downtown buildings throughout the 1890s. This led to the 1891 construction of Brooklyn's first skyscraper, the 10-story Franklin Trust Company Building. By 1901, the 13-story Temple Bar Building was completed and was the borough's first steel-beam high-rise, its largest office building, and its tallest at 164 feet (50 m). In the early 20th-century, the opening of multiple New York City Subway lines in Downtown Brooklyn spurred further development of tall commercial buildings. The Zoning Resolution of 1916, which required buildings to incorporate setbacks from the street to allow for sunlight, influenced the construction of taller, more slender buildings.\nIn 1918, the 22-story and 220-foot (67 m) building at 32 Court Street was completed and regarded as Brooklyn's first \"true skyscraper\", and thus initiated a skyscraper building boom in Brooklyn centered on Court and Montague Streets. Brooklyn's high-rise development continued unabated into the 1920s. The Court and Remsen Building, built in 1926 at 350 feet (107 m) in height, was the first of the major high-rises to be built in Brooklyn during the 1920s and briefly held the title of Brooklyn's tallest building until 1927, when the Montague–Court Building was completed and became Brooklyn's tallest building at 462 feet (141 m). Brooklyn's skyscraper building boom ceased during the Great Depression, and the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower in Fort Greene, which was completed in 1929, remained Brooklyn's tallest building until 2009.\nIn 2004, several portions of Downtown Brooklyn were rezoned to promote more commercial, residential, and retail development. This rezoning allowed for greater density of development, and combined with an increased demand for housing, these areas experienced a boom in the construction of tall buildings. In addition to Downtown Brooklyn, high-rise buildings are also concentrated in the Brooklyn Heights, Fort Greene, and Williamsburg neighborhoods, although other Brooklyn neighborhoods have significant numbers of high-rises. In 2019, One South First, situated on the Domino Park waterfront, became Williamsburg's tallest tower at 435 feet. The Brooklyn Tower which rises to a height of 1,066 feet in Downtown Brooklyn, became the tallest building in the New York City area outside of Manhattan, and the tallest building on Long Island.\n\n\n== Tallest buildings ==\nThere are over 60 completed or topped out skyscrapers in Brooklyn that stand at least 350 feet (107 m) tall, based on standard height measurement which includes spires and architectural details but does not include antenna masts.

Designed by the firm of Foster + Partners, the skyscraper is expected to rise 1,388 feet (423 m) when completed in 2025.\n\nThe tower replaces the 52-story Union Carbide Building, built in 1960 and demolished in 2021. The old structure was the headquarters of JPMorgan Chase, which is using 383 Madison Avenue until it can move into the new building. Before that, the old building was originally the headquarters of Union Carbide.\n\n\n== Site ==\nLocated in New York City's Midtown Manhattan neighborhood, 270 Park Avenue will occupy the entire city block bounded by Madison Avenue to the west, 48th Street to the north, Park Avenue to the east, and 47th Street to the south. The lot measures about 80,000 square feet (7,400 m2) with a frontage of 200 feet (61 m) on each avenue and 400 feet (120 m) on each street.\nThe lot is part of Terminal City, the area that developed rapidly after the 1913 completion of the largely underground Grand Central Terminal. The buildings erected in the following years included office buildings such as the Chanin Building, Bowery Savings Bank Building, and New York Central Building, and hotels such as the Biltmore, Commodore, Waldorf Astoria, and Summit. The site of the future 270 Park Avenue was occupied by a six-building complex, the Hotel Marguery, which opened in 1917 and was developed by Charles V. Paterno. The stone-clad hotel was 12 stories high and designed in the Renaissance Revival style. By 1920, the area had become what The New York Times called \"a great civic centre\".\nThe Hotel Marguery was replaced by the 52-story Union Carbide Building, the first structure to occupy the entire block, which opened in 1960. The building eventually became JPMorgan Chase's world headquarters. Among the site's current neighbors are the old New York Mercantile Library and 400 Madison Avenue to the west; Tower 49 to the northwest; 277 Park Avenue to the east; 245 Park Avenue to the southeast; and 383 Madison Avenue to the south.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nFoster and Partners designed the building, which will be 1,388 feet (423 m) tall. Sources disagree on the number of stories. The New York Times indicates that the building will rise 70 stories, Emporis cited a figure of 63 stories, and the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat gives a figure of 60 stories. There are 24 massive columns at the base, which will support a lobby measuring about 80 feet (24 m) high, with public space facing Madison and Park Avenues. Above the lobby will be a series of setbacks to the west and east, tapering to a pinnacle.\nThe interior will fit 15,000 employees and will contain a food hall, a penthouse conference center, a fitness center, and large spaces illuminated by natural lights. The floor plates will be able to be configured in several layouts. To comply with city legislation, which bans the use of natural gas in all new buildings constructed after 2027, the structure will be powered entirely by hydroelectric energy. Ninety-seven percent of materials from the old building were creatively reused, recycled, or otherwise diverted from landfills.\nThe design team also includes Adamson Associates as architect of record; Jaros, Baum & Bolles as MEP engineer; and Severud Associates as structural engineer.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Planning ===\nIn February 2018, JPMorgan announced it would demolish the former Union Carbide Building to make way for a structure that was almost twice as tall. This was the first major project to be announced as part of the Midtown East rezoning in the 2010s. The former building became the tallest voluntarily demolished building in the world, overtaking the previous record-holder Singer Building that was demolished in 1968.  The replacement 1,388-foot (423 m), 70-story headquarters would have space for 15,000 employees.

In the city, 25 buildings stand 200 feet (61 m) and taller. The tallest building in Oklahoma City, and in Oklahoma, is the 50-story Devon Tower, which rises 844 feet (257 m) above the central business district. Other notable skyscrapers are Chase Tower and First National Center, which stand as the second and third-tallest buildings in Oklahoma City, respectively. Five of the 10 tallest buildings in Oklahoma are located in Oklahoma City.\nThe history of skyscrapers in Oklahoma City began with the completion of the Colcord Hotel, Oklahoma City's first skyscraper. After oil was discovered in the area, the population of Oklahoma City grew significantly. As a result, the city's skyline expanded, which featured a \"race to the top\" with the synchronous construction of First National Center and City Place Tower in the central business district. Contemporary skyscrapers began to be built in the north and west sides of Oklahoma City, and later in the downtown area. In 1993, Oklahoma City voters approved the MAPS (Metropolitan Area Projects) program, which featured the construction of several  distinct domestic facilities and restorations and expansions of other older ones. It was completed in 2004 and is deemed to be the first program of its kind for a city the size of Oklahoma City.\nThe Devon Tower, which was completed in 2012, has overtaken the Chase Tower as the tallest building in Oklahoma City with a height of 844 feet (257 m). It has also become the tallest building in the state of Oklahoma, surpassing the BOK Tower in Tulsa.

The title of \"world's tallest building\" has been held  by various buildings in modern times, including Lincoln Cathedral in Lincoln, England, and the Empire State Building and the original World Trade Center, both in New York City.\nBefore the modern skyscraper era emerged, between c. 1311 and 1884 the tallest buildings and structures were mostly Christian churches and cathedrals. Prior to then, the tallest buildings in the world cannot be conclusively determined. For instance, the Lighthouse of Alexandria, which was completed in approximately 280 BC, has been estimated to have been 100 m (330 ft) tall, but its true height is not known. For thousands of years, the Great Pyramid in Egypt was the tallest structure in the world until Lincoln Cathedral of 1311, but the Great Pyramid is not considered a building since it is not habitable. Similarly, the Eiffel Tower was the world's tallest structure from 1889, when it was built, but not the tallest building.\nThe skyscraper was invented in Chicago in 1884 when Home Insurance Building was constructed using a steel frame with curtain walls instead of load-bearing walls. For the next century, the world's tallest building was always in the United States, with New York City housing the tallest building for  86 years and Chicago housing it for 30 years. After just over a century (1885–1998), the distinction of the world's tallest building moved to Malaysia, which was the first country to break the United States' record of constructing the tallest buildings in the world when Petronas Towers was completed in 1998. Taiwan's Taipei 101 was the next to hold the record; the building's status as the world's tallest building lasted from 2004 to 2009, when it was transferred to the Burj Khalifa, the current record-holder of 828 meters tall, upon its completion in the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\n== Definition of terms ==\n\n\n=== Meaning of \"building\" ===\nThe earliest structures now known to be the tallest in the world were the Egyptian pyramids: the Great Pyramid of Giza, at an original height of 146.5 m (481 ft), was the tallest structure in the world for over 3,800 years, until the construction of Lincoln Cathedral in 1311. From then until the completion of the Washington Monument (capped in 1884) the world's tallest structures were churches or cathedrals. Later, the Eiffel Tower and, still later, some radio masts and television towers, were the world's tallest structures.\nHowever, though all of these are structures, some are not buildings in the sense of being regularly inhabited or occupied. It is in this sense of being regularly inhabited or occupied that the term \"building\" is generally applied when determining the world's tallest building. The non-profit international organization Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH), which maintains a set of criteria for determining the height of tall buildings, defines a \"building\" as \"(A) structure that is designed for residential, business or manufacturing purposes\" and that \"has floors\".\nTall churches and cathedrals occupy a middle ground: their lower areas are regularly occupied, but much of their height is in bell towers and spires which are not. Whether a church or cathedral is a \"building\" or merely a \"structure\" for the purposes of determining the title of \"world's tallest building\" is a subjective matter of definition (this article treats churches and cathedrals as buildings).\n\n\n=== Determination of height ===\nThe Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) has been generally recognized as the arbiter on the building height of skyscrapers since the mid-20th century. In the early 1970's they promulgated the criteria that height is measured \"from the sidewalk of the main entrance to the structural top of the building including penthouse and tower.\" In 1996, during the controversy over whether the Petronas Twin Towers or the Sears Tower should be considered t\nSydney, the largest city in Australia, is home to 1,168 completed high-rise buildings, more than any other city in Australia. Of those completed or topped out, the entire city (including metropolitan suburbs) has 54 buildings that reach a height of at least 150 metres (490 ft), of which 17 reach a height of at least 200 metres (660 feet) – the second–highest number of skyscrapers in Australia, as well as a further 16 buildings rising to at least 150 metres (490 feet) in height currently under construction.\nAlthough the tallest buildings in the city have historically been concentrated in the central business district and immediate surrounding areas such as Barangaroo and Ultimo, suburbs within the Sydney metropolitan area have all seen a substantial surge in the development of high rises and skyscrapers in recent years, with major satellite centres such as Chatswood, Parramatta, North Sydney, St Leonards and Macquarie Park all witnessing or playing host to the construction of skyscrapers rising above 150 metres. As a result, Sydney has the tallest building and most skyscrapers (reaching at least 150 metres or above) outside an inner city area or core in Australia.\nSydney was one of the first cities in Australia and internationally to welcome the introduction of skyscrapers and high-rise office blocks in the mid 20th century, alongside cities in the U.S., including New York City and Chicago. Witnessing a boom in the 20th century, Sydney has played host to various buildings which have held the title of the tallest building in Australia including St James' Church, the Sydney Town Hall, the Garden Palace, the General Post Office, AWA Tower, AMP Building, 25 Martin Place, and the Australia Square tower in 1967 at 170 metres (560 feet) tall, which was Australia's first true skyscraper as defined as rising above or at least 150 metres high. Since 2020, Crown Sydney has been Sydney's tallest building and the 4th tallest building in Australia, rising to a height of 271 metres (889 feet).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nSydney played host to Australia's first tallest building in 1824 with the construction of St James' Church. Standing at a height of 52 metres (171 feet), it was commissioned by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1819, designed by Francis Greenway and constructed between 1820 and 1824 using convict labour. The partially complete Sydney Town Hall, built in Victorian Second Empire style, surpassed this height in 1878 with the completion of its clock tower that stood at a height of 57 metres (187 feet). This title was briefly held until the completion of the Garden Palace in 1879, standing at a height of 64 m (210 ft). The Garden Palace likewise only held this title as tallest briefly, after its demise from a fire in 1882. Hence, the Sydney Town Hall once again became Sydney's tallest until 1891 with the completion of the General Post Office. Standing at a height of 73 m (240 ft), the GPO was at the time described upon opening by the Postmaster General as a building that \"will not be surpassed by any other similar structure in the southern hemisphere\".\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century and throughout the beginning of the 20th century, advances in building technology and design coupled with rising urban land values meant that high rise buildings became an attractive proposition in Sydney. Considered to be Sydney's first high-rise office building, Culwulla Chambers, was completed in 1912 and stood at a height of 50 metres (160 ft). Designed by Spain, Cosh and Minnett (with Rupert Minnett), the building consisted of 14 floors and cost £100,000 to build, equivalent of approximately $1 million in today's money. This new wave of construction of taller buildings consequently raised concerns over fire risks, namely the inadequate firefighting resources of the period that failed to reach such heights. The fire in the 8 storey Anthony Hordern & Sons building in 1901, which resulted in the death of five peopl\nThe Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) defines a residential building as one where 85 percent or more of its total floor area is dedicated to residential usage.\nCurrently, the tallest residential building in the world is Central Park Tower in a part of Midtown Manhattan, New York City, colloquially referred to as \"Billionaires' Row\". It was topped out at a height of 472.4 metres (1,550 ft) in 2019.\nAs of 2024, New York City is also home to all top three tallest residential buildings in the world, while Dubai in the United Arab Emirates has five of the ten tallest.\n\n\n== History and ranking criteria ==\nSince 2000, when CTBUH started maintaining a list of tallest residential buildings, The Belcher's Tower 1 and The Belcher's Tower 2 located in Hong Kong were the first tallest residential buildings whose heights equal 221 metres (725 ft) and were completed in 2000.\nIn 2001, Trump World Tower in New York City became the tallest residential building in the world, until it was surpassed in 2003 by the 21st Century Tower followed by the Q1 on the Gold Coast in 2005. In 2012, Princess Tower in Dubai became the tallest residential building in the world, before being surpassed by 432 Park Avenue in New York City in 2014. The current tallest residential building, Central Park Tower, was topped out during September 2019 and completed in 2020.\nThe percentage of residential buildings whose height exceeds 200 metres increased from 34 percent in 2009 to 45 percent in 2010, making Burj Khalifa the world's first megatall building to include residential space.\nThe CTBUH insist that a building should only be added to the official tallest list when it is (i) topped out structurally and architecturally, (ii) fully clad, and (iii) open for business, or at least partially open. This became the CTBUH official definition of a building's \"completion\".\n\n\n== Tallest residential buildings ==\nThis lists ranks residential buildings that stand at least 300 metres (980 ft) tall, based on standard height measurement. This includes spires and architectural details, but does not include antenna masts. An equal sign (=) following a rank indicates the same height between two or more buildings.

The tallest structure in Toronto is the CN Tower, which rises 553.3 metres (1,815 ft). The CN Tower was the tallest free-standing structure on land from 1975 until 2007. However, it is not generally considered a high-rise building as it does not have successive floors that can be occupied. The tallest habitable building in the city is First Canadian Place, which rises 298 metres (978 ft) tall in Toronto's Financial District and was completed in 1975. It also stands as the tallest building in Canada.\nThe history of skyscrapers in Toronto began in 1894 with the construction of the Beard Building, which is often regarded as the first skyscraper in the city. Toronto went through its first building boom in the late 1920s and early 1930s, during which the number of high-rise buildings in the city vastly increased. After this period, there was a great lull in construction between 1932 and 1964 with only a single building above 91.5 metres (300 ft) tall being built.\nThe city then experienced a second, much larger building boom, which was at its peak between 1967 and 1976. This period saw the construction of Canada's three tallest buildings and six of its top ten (at the time). When topped off in 1967, the TD Bank Tower was the 14th tallest building in the world. The TD Tower would soon be followed by Commerce Court West, the 14th tallest building in the world at the time of its completion in 1972. Later, Canada's current tallest building, the First Canadian Place, became the eighth tallest building in the world at the time of its completion in 1975. After the mid-1970s, the pace of the boom slowed considerably but continued onto the early 1990s, culminating with the construction of the city's and Canada's second and third tallest buildings: Scotia Plaza and the TD Canada Trust Tower.\nAfter this boom, the city went through a third, shorter lull in construction from 1993 to 2004, in which the city added only one new building to its top 20. By 2005 however, the city's third and largest high-rise construction boom began with the completion of One King Street West and has continued unabated ever since with nearly 50 planned, under construction or recently built buildings over 152.4 metres (500 ft) tall. Of the 21 buildings in Toronto taller than 200 metres, only seven were built prior to 2010. In 2012, The St. Regis Toronto (then known as Trump International Hotel and Tower) was completed, with a top dome height of 252 m (827 ft) and an antenna height of 277 metres (908 ft), making it the fourth-tallest structure in Toronto and all of Canada. With the completion in late 2014 of Aura—which, at 78 storeys and a height of 272 m (892 ft), is the tallest residential building in Canada—the tallest building under construction is the 328.4-metre (1,077 ft) tall The One (though the developer applied for a height increase to 338 metres (1,109 ft)), also a residential building.\nNatalie Alcoba of the National Post described this phenomenon as the \"Manhattanization\" of Toronto in reference to the built-up nature of the namesake island borough in New York City. In one week of 2018, Toronto City Council approved 755 storeys of new development in the city's downtown core. The Toronto skyline (especially the CN Tower) can be spotted by the naked eye during clear daylight skies from locations as far as Newmarket from the north, Clarington from the east, several points along the Niagara Escarpment from the west, and Fort Niagara State Park in the south across Lake Ontario in the U.S. state of New York.\nAs of January 2023, Toronto has constructed 81 skyscrapers and has a further 36 under construction. Toronto also has 92 skyscrapers that are either approved or in the proposal stage. Toronto currently ranks 20th in the world with most skyscrapers already completed, third in North America and first in Canada. Toronto ranks fourth in the world and first in North America with the numb\nThe Spiral, also known as 66 Hudson Boulevard, is a 66-floor, 1,031-foot (314 m) skyscraper with 2.85 million square feet (265,000 m2), on 34th Street between Hudson Boulevard and Tenth Avenue in Hudson Yards, Manhattan, New York City. It was developed by Tishman Speyer, constructed by Turner Construction, and opened in 2023.\nThe building got its name as each floor has outdoor gardens that spiral around the facade of the building in a continuous green pathway. It was designed by Bjarke Ingels Group, which also designed the nearby West 57. Space Copenhagen provided interior design services. The building includes a clubhouse and an open-air terrace with panoramic city views on the 66th floor, along with a lounge. The building has an irrigation system provided by Bosch that is designed to save 4.5 million gallons of water per year compared to other systems.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe tower was conceptualized in 2014 as the Hudson Spire, with a 1,800-foot (550 m) roof height and a 2,000-foot (610 m) architectural height. It was marketed as the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere.\nTishman Speyer spent $438 million acquiring the site for the property.\nIn late 2015, Tishman Speyer paid $25 million to two men who lived together as tenants in a four-story building on the future site of the building to get them to relocate. While Tishman had prevailed in court, the tenants threatened to delay the development by five years via additional court cases.\nPlans for the building were filed in September 2016.\nIn April 2018, a mortgage real estate investment trust managed by Blackstone Inc. provided a $1.8 billion construction loan, one of the largest such loans in New York City history.\nThe building topped-out in January 2021.\nIn March 2023, the building won the CoStar Impact Award for best commercial development in the New York City region.\n\n\n== Tenants ==\nThe building includes a restaurant run by Erik Ramirez and Juan Correa in its base. Ramirez and Correa are known for Llama San, in the West Village and Llama Inn, in Williamsburg.\nTenants include:\n\nFloor 2: NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital - Och Spine Center\nFloors 3–5: HSBC\nFloors 7–21: Pfizer\nFloor 22: Baker Tilly\nFloor 23: NCC-group PLC\nFloors 25–28: AllianceBernstein\nFloor 28: ProShares, SEB Group\nFloors 32–33: Marshall Wace\nFloors 35–36: Turner Construction\nFloors 40–52: Debevoise & Plimpton\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of tallest buildings in New York City\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",
