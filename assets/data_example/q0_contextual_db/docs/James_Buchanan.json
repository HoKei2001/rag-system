{"page_content": "James Buchanan Jr. ( bew-KAN-\u0259n; April 23, 1791 \u2013 June 1, 1868) was the 15th president of the United States, serving from 1857 to 1861. Buchanan also served as the secretary of state from 1845 to 1849 and represented Pennsylvania in both houses of the U.S. Congress. He was an advocate for states' rights, particularly regarding slavery, and minimized the role of the federal government preceding the Civil War.\nBuchanan was a lawyer in Pennsylvania and won his first election to the state's House of Representatives as a Federalist. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1820 and retained that post for five terms, aligning with Andrew Jackson's Democratic Party. Buchanan served as Jackson's minister to Russia in 1832. He won the election in 1834 as a U.S. senator from Pennsylvania and continued in that position for 11 years. He was appointed to serve as President James K. Polk's secretary of state in 1845, and eight years later was named as President Franklin Pierce's minister to the United Kingdom.\nBeginning in 1844, Buchanan became a regular contender for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination. He was nominated and won the 1856 presidential election. As President, Buchanan intervened to assure the Supreme Court's majority ruling in the pro-slavery decision in the Dred Scott case. He acceded to Southern attempts to engineer Kansas' entry into the Union as a slave state under the Lecompton Constitution, and angered not only Republicans but also Northern Democrats. Buchanan honored his pledge to serve only one term and supported Breckinridge's unsuccessful candidacy in the 1860 presidential election. He failed to reconcile the fractured Democratic Party amid the grudge against Stephen Douglas, leading to the election of Republican and former Congressman Abraham Lincoln.\nBuchanan's leadership during his lame duck period, before the American Civil War, has been widely criticized. He simultaneously angered the North by not stopping secession and the South by not yielding to their demands. He supported the Corwin Amendment in an effort to reconcile the country. He made an unsuccessful attempt to reinforce Fort Sumter, but otherwise refrained from preparing the military. In his personal life, Buchanan never married and was the only U.S. president to remain a lifelong bachelor, leading some historians and authors to question his sexual orientation. His failure to forestall the Civil War has been described as incompetence, and he spent his last years defending his reputation. Historians and scholars rank Buchanan as among the worst presidents in American history.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\n\n=== Childhood and education ===\nJames Buchanan Jr. was born into a Scottish-Irish family on April 23, 1791, in a log cabin on a farm called Stony Batter, near Cove Gap, Peters Township, in the Allegheny Mountains of southern Pennsylvania. He was the last president born in the 18th century and, until the election of Joe Biden in 2020, the only one born in Pennsylvania. Buchanan was the second of eleven children with six sisters and four brothers, and the eldest son of James Buchanan Sr. (1761\u20131821) and his wife Elizabeth Speer (1767\u20131833). James Buchanan Sr., was an Ulster-Scot from just outside Ramelton, a small town in the north-east of County Donegal in the north-west of Ulster, the northern province in Ireland, who emigrated to the newly formed United States in 1783, having sailed from Derry. He belonged to the Clan Buchanan, whose members had emigrated in large numbers from the Scottish Highlands to Ulster in the north of Ireland during the Plantation of Ulster in the seventeenth century and, later, largely because of poverty and persecution by the Crown due to their Presbyterian faith, had further emigrated in large numbers from Ulster to America from the early eighteenth century onwards. Shortly after Buchanan's birth, the family relocated to a farm near Mercersburg, Pennsylvania, and later settled in the town in 1794. His father \nJames Buchanan Duke (December 23, 1856 \u2013 October 10, 1925) was an American tobacco and electric power industrialist best known for the invention of modern cigarette manufacture and marketing techniques, and his involvement with Duke University. He was the founder of the American Tobacco Company in 1890.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJames Buchanan Duke, known by the nickname \"Buck\", was born on December 23, 1856, near Durham, North Carolina, to tobacco manufacturer, philanthropist, and benefactor of Duke University, Washington Duke (1820\u20131905), and his second wife, Artelia Roney.\n\n\n== Business career ==\nDuke's father, Washington, had owned a tobacco company that his sons James and Benjamin (1855\u20131929) took over in the 1880s. In 1885, James Buchanan Duke acquired a license to use the first automated cigarette making machine (invented by James Albert Bonsack), and by 1890, Duke supplied 40 percent of the American cigarette market (then known as pre-rolled tobacco). In that year, Duke consolidated control of his four major competitors under one corporate entity, the American Tobacco Company, which was a monopoly as he controlled over 90 percent of the American cigarette market. His aggressive business tactics in cutting prices paid to tobacco farmers directly led to the Black Patch Tobacco Wars in 1906\u20131908.\n\nAt the start of the 1900s, Duke tried to conquer the British market as he had done the American, eventually forcing the then divided British manufacturers to merge into the Imperial Tobacco Company of Great Britain and Ireland, Ltd (Imperial Tobacco). After two years of intense competition in Great Britain, Imperial Tobacco took the fight to the U.S. market, forcing American Tobacco to look for a settlement. This resulted in an agreement whereby American Tobacco controlled the American trade, Imperial Tobacco controlled the trade in the British territories, and a third, cooperative venture named the British-American Tobacco Company was set up between the two to control the sale of tobacco in the rest of the world.\nDuring this time, Duke was repeatedly sued by business partners and shareholders. In 1906, the American Tobacco Company was found guilty of antitrust violations, and was ordered to be split into four separate companies: American Tobacco Company, Liggett & Myers, R. J. Reynolds, and the P. Lorillard Company. In 1911, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld an order breaking up the American Tobacco Company's monopoly. The company was then divided into several smaller enterprises, of which only the British-American Tobacco Company remained in Duke's control.\nIn 1892, the Dukes opened their first textile firm in Durham, North Carolina, which was run by Buck's brother Benjamin. At the turn of the century, Buck organized the American Development Company to acquire land and water rights on the Catawba River. In 1904, he established the Catawba Power Company and the following year he and his brother founded the Southern Power Company, which became known as Duke Power, the precursor to the Duke Energy conglomerate. The company supplied electrical power to the Dukes' textile factory and within two decades, their power facilities had been greatly expanded and they were supplying electricity to more than 300 cotton mills and other industrial companies. Duke Power established an electrical grid that supplied cities and towns in the Piedmont Region of North and South Carolina. Buck Steam Station in Rowan County, North Carolina, built in 1926, was named for Duke.Lake James, a power-generating reservoir in Western North Carolina, was created by the company in 1928 and also named in Duke's honor.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nDuke was married twice, first in 1904 to Lillian Fletcher McCredy (also known as Lillian Nanette Duke). They divorced in 1906 and had no children. In 1907 he married the widow Nanaline Holt Inman, with whom he had his only child, a daughter, Doris, born November 22, 1912. Doris was raised at Duke Farms located in Hillsborough, New Jersey,\nThe presidency of James Buchanan began on March 4, 1857, when James Buchanan was inaugurated as 15th president of the United States, and ended on March 4, 1861. Buchanan, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, took office as the  15th United States president after defeating John C. Fr\u00e9mont of the Republican Party and former President Millard Fillmore of the American Party in the 1856 presidential election. He declined to seek re-election and was succeeded by Republican Abraham Lincoln.\nBuchanan was nominated by the Democratic Party at its 1856 convention, where he defeated both the incumbent President Franklin Pierce and Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas. Despite his long experience in government, Buchanan was unable to calm the growing sectional crisis that would divide the nation at the close of his term. Prior to taking office, Buchanan lobbied the Supreme Court to issue a broad ruling in Dred Scott v. Sandford. Though Buchanan hoped that the Court's ruling would end the dispute over slavery in the territories, Buchanan's support of the ruling deeply alienated many Northerners. Buchanan also joined with Southern leaders in attempting to gain the admission of Kansas to the Union as a slave state under the Lecompton Constitution. In the midst of the growing chasm between slave states and free states, the Panic of 1857 struck the nation, causing widespread business failures and high unemployment.\nTensions over slavery continued to the end of Buchanan's term. Buchanan had promised in his inaugural address to serve just one term, and with the ongoing national turmoil over slavery and the nature of the Union, there was a deep yearning for fresh leadership within the Democratic Party. Republican nominee Abraham Lincoln, running on a platform devoted to keeping slavery out of all Western territories, defeated the splintered Democratic Party and Constitutional Union candidate John Bell to win the 1860 election. In response to Lincoln's victory, seven Southern states declared their secession from the Union. Buchanan refused to confront the seceded states with military force, but retained control of Fort Sumter. However, in its last two months the Buchanan Administration took a much stiffer anti-Confederate position, as Southerners resigned. The president announced that he would do all within his power to defend Fort Sumter, thereby rallying Northern support. Key anti-Confederate leaders included the new Attorney General Edwin Stanton and the new Secretary of War Joseph Holt. The secession crisis culminated in the outbreak of the American Civil War shortly after Buchanan left office. Historians condemn him for not forestalling the secession of Southern states or addressing the issue of slavery. He is consistently ranked as one of the worst presidents in American  history, often being ranked as the worst president.\n\n\n== Election of 1856 ==\n\nAfter Franklin Pierce won the 1852 presidential election, Buchanan agreed to serve as the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Buchanan's service abroad conveniently placed him outside of the country while a debate over the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act roiled the nation. While Buchanan did not overtly seek the 1856 Democratic presidential nomination, he deliberately chose not to discourage the movement on his behalf, something that was well within his power on many occasions. The 1856 Democratic National Convention met in June 1856, writing a platform that largely reflected Buchanan's views, including support for the Fugitive Slave Law, an end to anti-slavery agitation, and U.S. \"ascendancy in the Gulf of Mexico.\" Buchanan led on the first ballot, boosted by the support of powerful Senators John Slidell, Jesse Bright, and James A. Bayard, who presented Buchanan as an experienced leader who could appeal to the North and South. President Pierce and Senator Stephen A. Douglas also sought the nomination, but Buchanan was selected as the Democratic presidential nominee on the seventeenth ballot of the convent\nJames McGill Buchanan Jr. (; October 3, 1919 \u2013 January 9, 2013) was an American economist known for his work on public choice theory originally outlined in his most famous work, The Calculus of Consent, co-authored with Gordon Tullock in 1962. He continued to develop the theory, eventually receiving the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1986. Buchanan's work initiated research on how politicians' and bureaucrats' self-interest, utility maximization, and other non-wealth-maximizing considerations affect their decision-making. He was a member of the Board of Advisors of The Independent Institute as well as of the Institute of Economic Affairs, a member of the Mont Pelerin Society (MPS) and MPS president from 1984 to 1986, a Distinguished Senior Fellow of the Cato Institute, and professor at George Mason University.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBuchanan was born in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, the eldest of the three children of James and Lila (Scott) Buchanan. His paternal grandfather, John P. Buchanan, was governor of Tennessee from 1891 to 1893. According to Buchanan's 1992 memoir, when his father, James Buchanan, Sr., married in 1918 and began his family he borrowed heavily to mechanize and improve the farm, including the acquisition of a herd of Jersey cattle. The Buchanan farm suffered during the 1920s\u2014by the time James Buchanan, Jr. was old enough to work on the farm, all the work was done either manually or with mules and horses. Buchanan described his life on the farm as \"genteel poverty\" with neither indoor plumbing nor electricity.:\u200a19\u201322\u200a The house did contain his grandfather's library of books on politics.:\u200a19\u201322\u200a Unlike in other farm families where children regularly stayed home to help as farm labor, his mother insisted he never miss a day of school.:\u200a5\u200a While completing his first university degree in 1940 at Middle Tennessee State Teachers College he continued to live at home and work on the farm. In 1941 he completed his M.S. at the University of Tennessee.\n\n\n== World War II ==\nBuchanan attended the United States Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School in New York starting in September 1941. He was assigned to Honolulu, Hawaii in March 1942, where he served as an officer on Admiral Chester W. Nimitz's operations planning staff in the United States Navy.\nBuchanan attributed his dislike of what he considered \"Eastern elites\" to his six months of Navy officer training in New York in 1941.:\u200a49\u200a He believed that there was overt discrimination against young men from the South or West in favor of those who had attended what he called establishment universities in the Northeast. In a 2011 interview, Buchanan said that out of twenty \"boys from the establishment universities, 12 or 13 were picked against a background of a total of 600 [men].\":\u200a94\u201395\u200a He was completing his last month of training in New York during the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor.:\u200a50\u200a Buchanan said that \"in balance\" his work in operations planning during the war was \"easy.\":\u200a67\u200a He was discharged in November 1945.:\u200a48\u200a\n\n\n== Education ==\nWith the support of his wife, Ann Bakke, and the generous G.I. Bill education subsidy available to war veterans, Buchanan applied to graduate school.:\u200a4\u200a In his 1992 autobiography, Buchanan said that when he began his graduate studies in 1945 at the University of Chicago, he was unaware of how market-oriented the Chicago school of economics was. He stated that he was essentially socialist until he enrolled in a course taught by Frank Knight. Knight, who also taught leading economic thinkers such as Milton Friedman and George Stigler at the University of Chicago, was a founding member of the Mont Pelerin Society. Within six weeks of starting his studies, Buchanan said he was \"converted into a zealous advocate of the market order\". Knight became Buchanan's \"de facto\" PhD supervisor, and his 1948 dissertation, \"Fiscal Equity in a Federal State\", was heavily influenced by Knight. Buchanan did not consider himsel\nCaptain James Buchanan Eads (May 23, 1820 \u2013 March 8, 1887) was a world-renowned American civil engineer and inventor, holding more than 50 patents. \nEads' great Mississippi River Bridge at St. Louis was designated a National Historic Landmark by the Department of the Interior in 1964 and on October 21, 1974 was listed as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers. It was also awarded a Special Award of Recognition by the American Institute of Steel Construction in 1974 on the 100th anniversary of its entry into service. Eads also designed the jetties of the south pass of the Mississippi River, which were designated as National Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks in 1982.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nEads was born in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, and named for his mother's cousin, future President of the United States James Buchanan. Eads' father, Thomas C. Eads, pursued a fortune to no avail and the family moved several times. Eads grew up in St. Louis, Missouri. The family lost all of their possessions in a steamboat fire as they landed in St. Louis in 1833.  Thomas Eads' business ventures in St. Louis failed, and he abandoned his family and moved upriver.\nJames Eads was largely self-educated; at the age of 13, he left school to take up work to help support the family. He sold apples on the streets of St. Louis to help support his sisters and mother, who ran a boardinghouse. One of his first jobs was at the Williams & Duhring dry-goods store run by Barrett Williams. Williams allowed the young Eads to spend time in his library, located above the store. In Eads's spare time, he read books on physical science, mechanics, machinery, and civil engineering. When Eads became successful later in life and Williams suffered hardship, Eads reciprocated Williams' generosity by providing money for Williams' comfort in his old age.\n\n\n== Family ==\n\nAround 1842, Eads fell in love with Martha Dillon, a woman related to him by marriage. Martha's father was Patrick Dillon, a prominent St. Louis businessman. Patrick did not approve of the couple, as he wanted Martha to marry someone with money and influence. In October 1845, James and Martha wed without her father's consent.\nMartha moved in with Eads' parents in LeClaire, Iowa while Eads stayed behind in St. Louis to set up a glass works. Although their living arrangement was supposed to be temporary, the failure of his glass business made it permanent. Eads had many debts to pay off from the failed business and he went back to working in salvage.\nMartha died in October 1852 of cholera. She did not live to see Eads become successful. Five years after her death, when Eads retired from working on the river, he had amassed a fortune of $500,000.\nNine years after Martha's death, in 1861, Eads remarried.\n\n\n== Fortune ==\nWhen he was twenty-two, Eads designed a salvage boat and showed the drawings to two shipbuilders, Calvin Case and William Nelson. Although Eads had no previous experience and no capital for the project, Case and Nelson were impressed with him and the three became partners.\nAt that time, salvaging wrecks from the Mississippi River was nearly impossible because of strong currents. Eads made his initial fortune in salvage by creating a diving bell, using a 40 US gal (33 imp gal; 150 L) wine barrel to retrieve goods sunk in riverboat disasters. He also devised special boats for raising the remains of sunken ships from the river bed. Eads did much of the diving himself because the work was so dangerous. His work gave Eads an intimate knowledge of the river, as he explored its depths from the Gulf of Mexico to Iowa. Because of his detailed knowledge of the Mississippi (the equal of any professional river pilot), his exceptional ability at navigating the most treacherous parts of the river system, and his personal fleet of snag-boats and salvage craft, he was afforded the much prized courtesy title of \"Captain\" by the rivermen of the Mississippi a\nJames Buchanan Henry (March 1, 1833 \u2013 February 17, 1915) was a lawyer, writer, Private Secretary to the President of the United States, nephew and ward of James Buchanan. He was the first man to hold this office after it became a paid government post. He held this position for two years.\nJ. B. Henry was the son of Harriet Elizabeth Buchanan (1802\u20131840) and the Reverend Robert Henry (1801\u20131838). At age seven, Henry was adopted by uncle James Buchanan and raised as his ward. Buchanan wanted his nephew to become an attorney like him, and paid for his admittance and education at Princeton in 1850. In 1851 he sent Henry to study law in Philadelphia with John Cadwalader.\nPrior to Henry, each president paid the wages of his private secretaries out of his own pocket. Some of Henry's duties included drawing the President's salary and paying all of the bills. His post was in the office of the southeast corner room, second floor. He served there between the years 1857 to 1859. Henry was succeeded by his cousin, James Buchanan II (1834\u20131877).\nAfter leaving the White House, he practiced law in New York City, where he served as Assistant United States District Attorney.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nJames Buchanan \"Bucky\" Barnes is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Originally introduced as a sidekick to Captain America, the character was created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby and first appeared in Captain America Comics #1 (cover-dated March 1941) (which was published by Marvel's predecessor, Timely Comics). Barnes' original costume (or one based on it) and the Bucky nickname have been used by other heroes in the Marvel Universe over the years.\nThe character is brought back from supposed death as the brainwashed assassin cyborg called the Winter Soldier (created by Ed Brubaker and Steve Epting) (Russian: \u0417\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0421\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0430\u0442, translit. Zimniy Sold\u00e1t). The character's memories and personality are later restored, leading him to become a dark hero in search of redemption. He temporarily assumes the role of Captain America when Steve Rogers was presumed to be dead. During the 2011 crossover Fear Itself, Barnes is injected with the Infinity Formula, which increases his natural vitality and physical traits in a way similar to (but less powerful than) the super-soldier serum used on Captain America.  After coming into contact with the shadowy Outer Circle, Barnes becomes their New Revolution, bringing the organization down from within. \nSebastian Stan plays the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Ant-Man (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Black Panther (2018), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019), the miniseries The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021), the animated series What If...? (2021), and the upcoming film Thunderbolts* (2025).\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nWhen Joe Simon created his initial sketch of Captain America for Marvel Comics precursor Timely Comics in 1940, he included a young sidekick. \"The boy companion was simply named Bucky, after my friend Bucky Pierson, a star on our high school basketball team\", Simon said in his autobiography. Following the character's debut in Captain America Comics #1 (March 1941), Bucky Barnes appeared alongside the title star in virtually every story in that publication and other Timely series, and was additionally part of the all-kid team the Young Allies. In the post-war era, with the popularity of superheroes fading, Bucky appeared alongside team-leader Captain America in the two published adventures of Timely/Marvel's first superhero group, the All-Winners Squad, in All Winners Comics #19 and #21 (Fall\u2013Winter 1946; there was no issue #20).\nAfter Bucky was shot and seriously wounded in Captain America Comics #66 (April 1948), he was succeeded by Captain America's girlfriend Betsy Ross, who became the superhero Golden Girl. Bucky recovered and was briefly reunited with Captain America for an appearance in Captain America Comics #71 (March 1949), but otherwise did not appear for the rest of the run. Captain America Comics ended with #75 (Feb. 1950), by which time the series had been titled Captain America's Weird Tales for two issues, with the finale a horror/suspense anthology issue with no superheroes.\nCaptain America and Bucky were both briefly revived, along with fellow Timely stars the Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner, in the omnibus Young Men #24 (Dec. 1953), published by Marvel's 1950s iteration Atlas Comics. Bucky appeared alongside \"Captain America, Commie Smasher!\", as the hero was cover-billed, in stories published during the next year in Young Men and Men's Adventures, as well as in three issues of Captain America that continued the old numbering. Sales were poor, however, and the series was discontinued with Captain America #78 (Sept. 1954).\nRetroactive continuity, beginning with The Avengers #4 (March 1964), established that the original Captain America and Bucky went missing near the end of World War II and were secretly replaced by then-U.S. President Harry S. Truman with successor heroes using those identities\nJames Buchanan \"Bucky\" Barnes is a fictional character portrayed by  Sebastian Stan in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise\u2014based on the Marvel Comics  character of the same name. Barnes is childhood best friends with Steve Rogers and serves alongside him in the Howling Commandos during World War II. Barnes is seemingly killed in action, but is actually captured by elements of Hydra within the Soviet Union. He is brainwashed and transformed into a super soldier with a metal arm known as the Winter Soldier. In their quest for world domination, Hydra uses a programmed Barnes as an assassin throughout the 20th century.\nBarnes comes into conflict with Rogers and his allies during the Hydra uprising, eventually gaining some control over himself. However, Helmut Zemo later takes control of Barnes to destroy the Avengers. This conflict, along with internal strife over the Sokovia Accords, causes the Avengers to split up and Rogers is forced to hide Barnes in Wakanda, where Shuri eventually cures him of his programming and is given a new code name, White Wolf.  \nBarnes aids the Avengers in the conflict against Thanos, falling victim to the Blip. After he is restored to life, he joins the final and victorious battle against a variant of Thanos. After Rogers' retirement, Barnes is pardoned by the U.S. government and strives to make amends for his murderous past. He joins Sam Wilson in defeating the pro-Blip Flag Smashers.\nAs of 2023, Barnes has appeared in seven MCU films, as well as in a lead role in the miniseries The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021). He is expected to return in the upcoming film Thunderbolts* (2025). Stan's portrayal of the character has been met with positive reception. He and Stan Lee are the only characters besides Rogers who appeared in all three Captain America films.\nAlternate versions of Barnes from within the MCU Multiverse appear in the animated series What If...? (2021\u2013present).\n\n\n== Concept and creation ==\nWhen Joe Simon created his initial sketch of Captain America for Marvel Comics precursor Timely Comics in 1940, he included a young sidekick. \"The boy companion was simply named Bucky, after my friend Bucky Pierson, a star on our high school basketball team,\" Simon said in his autobiography. Following the character's debut in Captain America Comics #1 (March 1941), Bucky Barnes appeared alongside the title star in virtually every story in that publication and other Timely series, and was additionally part of the all-kid team the Young Allies. Live-action performances of Steve Rogers in television and film serials began within a few years after its creation, with a 1990 feature film resulting in critical and financial failure, but none of these adaptations included Bucky as a character.\nIn 2005, Marvel launched a new Captain America series (Volume 5) with writer Ed Brubaker, who revealed that Bucky did not die in World War II. It was revealed that after the plane exploded, General Vasily Karpov and the crew of a Russian patrol submarine found Bucky's cold-preserved body, albeit with his left arm severed. Bucky was revived in Moscow, but had brain damage with amnesia as a result of the explosion. Scientists attached a bionic arm, periodically upgrading it as technology improved. Programmed to be a Soviet assassin for Department X \u2013 under the code name the Winter Soldier \u2013 he is sent on covert wetwork missions and becomes increasingly ruthless and efficient as he kills in the name of the state.\nIn the mid-2000s, Kevin Feige realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the Avengers, which included Captain America and his associated characters. Feige, a self-professed \"fanboy\", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early 1960s. In 2005, Marvel received a $525 million investment from Merrill Lynch, allowing them to independently produce ten films, including Captain America. Paramount Picture\nThe inauguration of James Buchanan as the 15th president of the United States was held on Wednesday, March 4, 1857, at the East Portico of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. This was the 18th inauguration and marked the commencement of the only four-year term of both James Buchanan as president and John C. Breckinridge as vice president. Chief Justice Roger B. Taney administered the presidential oath of office. This was the first inauguration ceremony known to be photographed.\n\n\n== Inaugural address ==\n\nIn his lengthy inaugural address, President Buchanan referred to the \"Territorial Question\" of slavery spreading into the West and made it clear that he was in favor of the previously passed Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act in 1854 which allowed for popular sovereignty to decide on the issue. He did not, however, speak on the rampant voter fraud that was occurring as both Northerners and Southerners flocked to Kansas to sway the vote in their favor, nor did he speak to the violence that was occurring in the streets as a result of the tense feelings between both regions of the country.\nBuchanan was criticized for not taking a strong stance on the decisive issue of slavery, and made it clear that he would \"cheerfully accept\" the opinion of the Supreme Court in the case of Dred Scott v. Sandford.\nAdditionally, Buchanan spoke at length regarding the country's economy and laid out plans for the nation's budget, including increasing the size of the Navy to protect the nation's interests in the East. Moreover, Buchanan discussed his strong feelings that a strict interpretation of the Constitution was the only safe manner in which to operate the federal government while simultaneously defending the appropriation of funds to a Trans-Atlantic road granted by Congress in order to protect California and other holdings on the Western Coast. In particular, Buchanan noted the difficulties that the Rocky Mountains would present in creating such a pathway, but defending it as a necessary work for the nation to undertake.\nBuchanan rounded out his inaugural address by touting the United States' history of taking possession of new lands, stating that territories and holdings were taken peacefully, and enjoyed increased economic trade and prosperity due to the paternal influence of America.\n\n\n== Political controversy ==\n\nBuchanan was seen to hold a whispered conversation with Roger Taney (chief justice of the Supreme Court) during the festivities. This \u2014 combined with Buchanan's reference in his inaugural speech to a coming Supreme Court decision that would \"speedily and finally\" settle disputes over slavery in the U.S. territories, and the issuance of the Dred Scott v. Sandford ruling (supporting Buchanan's views) two days after the speech \u2014 gave rise to suspicions among many supporters of the Republican Party that Buchanan and Taney had conducted improper pre-decision consultations on the Dred Scott case at the inaugural, violating principles of executive-judicial separation. In fact, such consultations had taken place, but in written letters between Buchanan and Supreme Court judge John Catron in February.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPresidency of James Buchanan\n1856 United States presidential election\nNational Hotel disease\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMore documents from the Library of Congress\n20th Presidential Inauguration (Buchanan) from Our Campaigns\nText of Buchanan's Inaugural Address\nWheatland, or the James Buchanan House, is a brick Federal style house which is located in Lancaster Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, outside of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. It was formerly owned by the 15th president of the United States, James Buchanan.\nThe house was constructed in 1828 by William Jenkins, a local lawyer. The second owner was Thomas Fuller Potter. He sold it to William M. Meredith in 1845. \nWheatland changed hands again in 1848, when it was purchased by Buchanan. Buchanan occupied the house for the next two decades, except for several years during his ambassadorship in Great Britain and during his presidency. After his death in 1868, Wheatland was inherited by Buchanan's niece, Harriet Lane, who sold it in 1884 to George Willson. \nIt was inherited by a relative of Willson's in 1929. Wheatland was put up for sale again after the relative died in 1934 and was acquired by a group of people who set up a foundation for the purpose of preserving the house. Wheatland was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966.  It was designated a contributing property to the Northeast Lancaster Township Historic District in 1980. The foundation and the adjacent historical society merged in 2009.\n\n\n== Location ==\n \nWheatland is located off Pennsylvania Route 23 (Marietta Avenue) in Lancaster Township, about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from the center of the city of Lancaster. It is situated on 10 acres (40,470 m2) of land, which it shares with Lancaster County's historical society, at the intersection of Marietta Avenue and President Avenue.\nThe region was originally inhabited by the Susquehannocks, who were first encountered in what is now Lancaster County by John Smith in 1608. They were also known to early settlers of the area as the \"Conestogas\", after the creek they resided near. In 1680, William Penn received a charter from Charles II for land to found the Province of Pennsylvania; Penn divided the land into the three counties: Bucks, Chester and Philadelphia. Lancaster County was formed from parts of Chester County on May 10, 1729. Lancaster Township was settled between 1717 and 1720, and was incorporated out of portions of Conestoga Township in 1729. The city of Lancaster was laid out in March 1730 and was incorporated as a borough in August 1742, before being incorporated as a city on March 20, 1818.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn November 20, 1824, over 403 acres (1,630,883 m2) of land was turned over to a bank in Lancaster by a farmer. The bank sold 165 acres (1 km2) and 68 square perches (18,513 ft2; 1,720 m2) of that land, on January 29, 1828, for $11,731.871\u20442, (equal to $325,506 today), through the use of a straw man, to William Jenkins, a lawyer and, then, president of said bank. Jenkins had a house constructed on the property and named it \"The Wheatlands\", either after the surrounding wheatfields or because the site of the house used to be a wheatfield. Jenkins sold 17 acres (68,797 m2) and 253\u20444 square perches (7,010 ft2; 651 m2) of land, including the house, to his son-in-law Thomas Fuller Potter in 1836. William M. Meredith bought the same plot on May 8, 1845, plus an additional 5 acres (20,234 m2), for $6,750, equal to $220,725 today.  Meredith used it as primarily a summer house and as a home for his wife and children; Meredith's duties as head of the bar in Philadelphia prevented him from living at Wheatland on a permanent basis.\nWheatland was put up for sale by Meredith and was contacted in June 1848 by Secretary of State James Buchanan, who was interested in the house. The sale of Wheatland was delayed by Meredith, who was not sure whether he really wanted to sell the estate, and by Buchanan, who did not want to force Meredith into making a decision that he might regret. Wheatland was sold in December 1848 at the same price that Meredith had purchased it at; Buchanan moved into the mansion several months later, accompanied by his niece, Harriet Lane\nJames Paul \"Buck\" Buchanan (April 30, 1867 \u2013 February 22, 1937) served as U.S. Representative from the 10th district of Texas from 1913 until his death on February 22, 1937.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBuchanan was born in Midway, Orangeburg County, South Carolina, on April 30, 1867; later that year, his family moved to Texas and settled near Chappell Hill in Washington County. He attended the local schools of Chappell Hill, and in 1889 he received his law degree from the University of Texas at Austin.\nLater in 1889, Buchanan began a law practice in Washington County, and almost immediately became involved in politics as a Democrat.  He served as a county justice of the peace from 1889 to 1892, and as the county's prosecuting attorney from 1892 to 1899.  From 1899 to 1906, Buchanan was the district attorney for the twenty-first judicial district.\nBuchanan was a member of the Texas House of Representatives from 1906 to 1913.  In 1913, he was elected to the Sixty-third Congress, filling the vacancy left by the resignation of Albert Sidney Burleson.  Buchanan was elected to a full term in the Sixty-fourth Congress, and won reelection eleven times.  He served in the US House from April 15, 1913 to February 22, 1937, and was the chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations from 1933 until his death.\nDuring the 1930s, Buchanan was recognized as a member of the Miller Group, conservative Democrats who were opposed to Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, and led by lobbyist Henry Pomeroy Miller.\n\n\n== Death and burial ==\nBuchanan died in Washington, D.C., on February 22, 1937. He was buried at Prairie Lea Cemetery in Brenham, Texas.\nHe was succeeded in Congress by Lyndon B. Johnson, then the head of the National Youth Administration in Texas and an ardent New Dealer, who later became the 36th President and vice president of the United States.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nBuchanan Dam and the lake it forms, Lake Buchanan, are named in his honor.

He joined a Glasgow shipping firm as an office boy when he was fourteen or fifteen, and was later promoted to be a clerk. In 1868 he joined his brother in the grain business until 1879, when he moved to London as an agent for a company in the whisky trade. He realized that there was an untapped market in England for bottled Scotch whisky and set about producing his own, the Buchanan Blend.\nHe went into business on his own in 1884 as James Buchanan & Co and producing the first Buchanan's Blend.\nIn 1898, James Buchanan was given the Royal Warrant to supply the Royal Household with Buchanan's Whisky to Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales.\nThe company joined Distillers Company in 1925.

Of these, only one, Martin Van Buren, learned English as his second language; his first language was Dutch. Four of the earliest presidents were multilingual, with John Quincy Adams and Thomas Jefferson demonstrating proficiency in a number of foreign languages.\nJames A. Garfield and his successor Chester A. Arthur knew Ancient Greek and Latin, but it was Garfield's ambidexterity that would lead to rumors that he could write both at the same time. Both Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke French, and Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke German. As for Asian languages, James Madison studied Hebrew, Herbert Hoover spoke some Mandarin Chinese, while Barack Obama spoke Indonesian fluently as a child.\n\n\n== 18th century ==\n\n\n=== John Adams ===\nJohn Adams, the second president of the United States, learned to read Latin at a young age. In preparation for attending Harvard University, Adams attended a school for improving his Latin skills. While posted in France during the Revolutionary War, Adams became fluent in French.\n\n\n== 19th century ==\n\n\n=== Thomas Jefferson ===\nThomas Jefferson spoke and read multiple languages, which included French. According to notes he made while traveling in 1788, he was able to speak French, Latin, and Italian. He claimed to be able to read, as of 1817, these languages along with Greek and Spanish. He also studied and wrote about the Anglo-Saxon language (Old English) and studied German to some extent. After his death, a number of other books, dictionaries, and grammar manuals in various languages were found in Jefferson's library, suggesting that he studied additional languages, possibly including Arabic, Irish, and Welsh. His proficiency in these languages is not known.\nRegarding Spanish, Jefferson told John Quincy Adams that he had learned the language over the course of nineteen days while sailing from the United States to France. He had borrowed a Spanish grammar and a copy of Don Quixote from a friend and read them on the voyage. Adams expressed skepticism, noting Jefferson's tendency to tell \"large stories.\"\n\n\n=== James Madison ===\nJames Madison began his studies of Latin at the age of twelve and had mastered Greek, Latin, Italian, and French (the last reportedly with a Scottish accent) by the time he entered the College of New Jersey, later Princeton University. He produced many translations of Latin orations of Grotius, Pufendorf, and Vattel. He also studied Horace and Ovid. He learned Greek as an admissions requirement for higher college learning.\nWhile in college, Madison learned to speak and read Hebrew. When he could have graduated, Madison remained at college for an additional year to study ethics and Hebrew in greater depth.\n\n\n=== James Monroe ===\nJames Monroe was enrolled in the best school in the colony of Virginia, which is why Monroe was later able to immediately take advanced courses in Latin at the College of William & Mary.\nJames Monroe adopted many French customs while a diplomat in Paris, including learning fluent French. The entire Monroe family knew the language, and often spoke it with one another at home.\n\n\n=== John Quincy Adams ===\nJohn Quincy Adams went to school in both France and the Netherlands, and spoke fluent French and conversational Dutch. Adams strove to improve his abilities in Dutch throughout his life, and at times translated a page of Dutch a day to help improve his mastery of the language. Official documents that he translated were sent to the Secretary of State of the United States, so that Adams' studies would serve a useful purpose as well. When his father appointed him United States Ambassador to Prussia, Adams dedicated himself to becoming proficient in German in order to have the tools to strengthen relations between the two countries. He improved his skills by translating article\nThe James Buchanan Memorial is a bronze, granite, and concrete memorial in the southeast corner of Meridian Hill Park, Washington, D.C., that honors U.S. President James Buchanan. It was designed by architect William Gorden Beecher, and sculpted by Maryland artist Hans Schuler. The memorial was commissioned in 1916, but not approved by the U.S. Congress until 1918. The memorial features a statue of Buchanan bookended by male and female classical figures representing law and diplomacy, engraved with text from a member of Buchanan's cabinet, Jeremiah S. Black: \"The incorruptible statesman whose walk was upon the mountain ranges of the law.\"\nBuchanan had served in various roles for the U.S. government until his election as president in 1856. His term was fraught with several crises, including his inability to stop the Civil War. He is often rated as one of the worst U.S. presidents. His niece, Harriet Lane, served as First Lady during Buchanan's term since he was a bachelor. Later in her life, Lane bequeathed $100,000 for the government to erect a memorial honoring Buchanan in Washington, D.C. After years of debate and delays in constructing Meridian Hill Park, the memorial was finally unveiled and dedicated in June 1930.\nThe memorial is a contributing property to the Meridian Hill Historic District, a National Historic Landmark. The historic district was added to the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites in 1964 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Biography ===\nJames Buchanan was born on April 23, 1791, in Cove Gap, Pennsylvania. He attended Dickinson College and graduated in 1809. Buchanan showed a keen interest in law and was admitted to the bar in 1812. During the War of 1812, Buchanan was one of the early volunteers to fight the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Following the war, Buchanan was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, where he served for two years. Five year later in 1821, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served for ten years. After his tenure in the House, Buchanan served as U.S. Minister to Russia from 1832-1833.\nBuchanan was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1834 and served until 1845 when he was chosen to be U.S. Secretary of State. He served in that role until 1849 and was chosen to be Minister to the United Kingdom. Buchanan was elected to be President of the United States in 1857. He only served one term and his presidency is considered one of the worst in U.S. history.\nHistorian Edward L. Widmer described Buchanan's presidency as the following: \"Repeatedly, he made terrible decisions, and when presented with various options, pursued the most extreme pro-slavery position (despite the fact that he came from Pennsylvania). He chose a Cabinet dominated by corrupt slave owners who lined their own pockets and stole government assets. When crises came, he had no answers, because he didn\u2019t think the federal government should intervene. As more people questioned his choices, he angrily dismissed their criticism.\" The biggest failure of his presidency is often cited to be his inability to avert the Civil War.\n\n\n=== Memorial ===\n\n\n==== Planning ====\nHarriet Lane was the niece of Buchanan, and since Buchanan was a bachelor, acted as First Lady of the United States during his presidency. In her will, Lane bequeathed $100,000 for the federal government to erect a memorial of her uncle. There was a stipulation that it had to be accepted by U.S. Congress within 15 years of her death, or the money would return to her estate. In January 1916, Senator Blair Lee I introduced a joint resolution to erect a memorial to Buchanan.\nLater that year, the United States Commission of Fine Arts approved the memorial's design. In December 1916, the Pennsylvania Society at Perpetual Hall asked Congress to pass the resolution to erect the memorial, honoring the only president who was from Pennsylvania at that time. \nThere was a contenti\nIn political studies, surveys have been conducted in order to construct historical rankings of the success of the presidents of the United States. Ranking systems are usually based on surveys of academic historians and political scientists or popular opinion. The scholarly rankings focus on presidential achievements, leadership qualities, failures, and faults.\nPopular-opinion polls typically focus on recent or well-known presidents. \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nA 1948 poll was conducted by historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr. of Harvard University. A 1962 survey was also conducted by Schlesinger, who surveyed 75 historians. Schlesinger's son, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., conducted another poll in 1996.\nThe Chicago Tribune surveyed  49 historians in 1982.\nThe Siena College Research Institute has conducted surveys in 1982, 1990, 1994, 2002, 2010, 2018 and 2022 \u2013 during the second year of the first term of each president since Ronald Reagan. These surveys collect presidential rankings from historians, political scientists, and presidential scholars in a range of attributes, abilities, and accomplishments. The 1994 survey placed only two presidents, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln, above 80 points and two presidents, Andrew Johnson and Warren G. Harding, below 50 points.\nIn 1996, William J. Ridings Jr. and Stuart B. McIver conducted and published a poll and in 1997, an accompanying book on the poll results. 719 people took part in the poll, primarily academic historians and political scientists, although some politicians and celebrities also took part. Participants from every state were included and emphasis was placed upon getting input from female historians and \"specialists in African American studies\" as well as a few non-American historians. Poll respondents rated the presidents in five categories (leadership qualities, accomplishments, crisis management, political skill, appointments, and character and integrity) and the results were tabulated to create the overall ranking.\n\n\n=== 2000\u20132017 ===\nA 2005 presidential poll was conducted by James Lindgren for the Federalist Society and The Wall Street Journal. As in the 2000 survey, the editors sought to balance the opinions of liberals and conservatives, adjusting the results \"to give Democratic- and Republican-leaning scholars equal weight\". Franklin D. Roosevelt still ranked in the top three, but editor James Taranto noted that Democratic-leaning scholars rated George W. Bush the sixth-worst president of all time while Republican scholars rated him the sixth-best, giving him a split-decision rating of \"average\".\nIn 2008, The Times daily newspaper of London asked eight of its own \"top international and political commentators\" to rank all 42 presidents \"in order of greatness\".\nThe C-SPAN Survey of Presidential Leadership consists of rankings from a group of presidential historians and biographers. The C-SPAN Survey of Presidential Leadership has taken place four times: in 2000, 2009, 2017, and 2021. The 2021 survey was of 142 presidential historians, surveyed by C-SPAN's Academic Advisor Team, made up of Douglas G. Brinkley, Edna Greene Medford, Richard Norton Smith, and Amity Shlaes. In the survey, each historian rates each president on a scale of one (\"not effective\") to 10 (\"very effective\") on presidential leadership in ten categories: Public Persuasion, Crisis Leadership, Economic Management, Moral Authority, International Relations, Administrative Skills, Relations with Congress, Vision/Setting An Agenda, Pursued Equal Justice for All and Performance Within the Context of His Times\u2014with each category equally weighed. The results of all four C-SPAN surveys have been fairly consistent. Abraham Lincoln has taken the highest ranking in each survey and George Washington, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Theodore Roosevelt have always ranked in the top five while James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson, and Franklin Pierce have been ranked at the bottom of all four surveys.\nTh\nJames Vernon Buchanan (born January 10, 1982) is an American politician in the state of Florida. He is a Republican member of the Florida House of Representatives representing the state's 74th district, which includes part of Sarasota County.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn his first run for elected office, Buchanan was defeated by Democrat Margaret Good in a nationally publicized February 2018 special election to fill the 72nd district seat in the Florida House. Buchanan had previously been a candidate in the 71st district, but withdrew his candidacy.\nBuchanan is the son of U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan.\n\n\n== Florida House of Representatives ==\nBuchanan defeated Linda Yates in the August 28, 2018 Republican primary, winning 59.2% of the vote. In the November 6, 2018 general election, Buchanan won 56.91% of the vote, defeating Democrat Tony Mowry and a third candidate.

The plenary power to grant a pardon or a reprieve is granted to the president by Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution; the only limits mentioned in the Constitution are that pardons are limited to federal offenses, and that they cannot affect an impeachment process: \"The president shall ... have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment\".\nThough pardons have been challenged in the courts, and the power to grant them challenged by Congress, the courts have consistently declined to put limits on the president's discretion. The president can issue a full pardon, reversing a criminal conviction (along with its legal effects) as if it never happened. A pardon can be issued from the time an offense is committed, and can even be issued after the full sentence has been served. The president can issue a reprieve, commuting a criminal sentence, lessening its severity, its duration, or both while leaving a record of the conviction in place. Additionally, the president can make a pardon conditional, or vacate a conviction while leaving parts of the sentence in place, like the payment of fines or restitution.\nPardons granted by presidents from George Washington until Grover Cleveland's first term (1885\u201389) were handwritten by the president; thereafter, pardons were prepared for the president by administrative staff requiring only that the president sign it. The records of these presidential acts were openly available for public inspection until 1934. In 1981 the Office of the Pardon Attorney was created and records from President George H. W. Bush forward are listed.\n\n\n== Summary ==\n\n\n== George Washington ==\nPresident George Washington pardoned, commuted, or rescinded the convictions of 16 people.

The confrontation lasted from May 1857 to July 1858. The conflict primarily involved Mormon settlers and federal troops, escalating from tensions over governance and autonomy within the territory. There were several casualties, predominantly non-Mormon civilians. Although the war featured no significant military battles, it included the Mountain Meadows Massacre, where Mormon militia members disarmed and murdered about 120 settlers traveling to California.\nThe resolution of the Utah War came through negotiations that permitted federal troops to enter Utah Territory in exchange for a pardon granted to the Mormon settlers for any potential acts of rebellion. This settlement significantly reduced the tensions and allowed for the re-establishment of federal authority over the territory while largely preserving Mormon interests and autonomy.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nIn 1857\u20131858, President James Buchanan sent U.S. forces to the Utah Territory in what became known as the Utah Expedition. Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), also known as Mormons or Latter-day Saints, fearful that the large U.S. military force had been sent to annihilate them and having faced persecution in other areas, made preparations for defense. Though bloodshed was to be avoided, and the U.S. government also hoped that its purpose might be attained without the loss of life, both sides prepared for war. The Mormons manufactured or repaired firearms, turned scythes into bayonets, and burnished and sharpened long-unused sabres.\nRather than engaging the Army directly, the Mormon strategy was one of hindering and weakening them. Daniel H. Wells, Lieutenant-General of the Nauvoo Legion, instructed Major Joseph Taylor:\n\nOn ascertaining the locality or route of the troops, proceed at once to annoy them in every possible way. Use every exertion to stampede their animals and set fire to their trains. Burn the whole country before them and on their flanks. Keep them from sleeping by night surprises; blockade the road by felling trees or destroying the river fords where you can. Watch for opportunities to set fire to the grass on their windward so as, if possible, to envelop their trains. Leave no grass before them that can be burned. Keep your men concealed as much as possible, and guard against surprise.\nThe Mormons blocked the army's entrance into the Salt Lake Valley, and weakened the U.S. Army by hindering them from receiving provisions.\nThe confrontation between the Mormon militia, called the Nauvoo Legion, and the U.S. Army involved some destruction of property and a few brief skirmishes in what is today southwestern Wyoming, but no battles occurred between the contending military forces.\nAt the height of the tensions, on September 11, 1857, at least 120 California-bound settlers from Arkansas, Missouri and other states, including unarmed men, women, and children, were killed in remote southwestern Utah by a group of local Mormon militia. The Mormon militia responsible for the massacre first claimed that the migrants were killed by Natives but it was proven otherwise. This event was later called the Mountain Meadows Massacre, and the motives behind the incident remain unclear.\nThe Aiken Massacre took place the following month. In October 1857, Mormons arrested six Californians traveling through Utah and charged them with being spies for the U.S. Army. They were released but were later murdered and robbed of their stock and $25,000.\nOther incidents of violence have also been linked to the Utah War, including a Native American attack on the Mormon mission of Fort Lemhi in eastern Oregon Territory, modern-day Idaho. They killed two Mormons and wounded several others.

A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Andrew Jackson and a member of the Democratic Party, he was an advocate of Jacksonian democracy and extending the territory of the United States. Polk led the U.S. into the Mexican\u2013American War, and after winning the war he annexed the Republic of Texas, the Oregon Territory, and the Mexican Cession.\nAfter building a successful law practice in Tennessee, Polk was elected to its state legislature in 1823 and then to the United States House of Representatives in 1825, becoming a strong supporter of Jackson. After serving as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, he became Speaker of the House in 1835, the only person to serve both as Speaker and U.S. president. Polk left Congress to run for governor of Tennessee, winning in 1839 but losing in 1841 and 1843. He was a dark-horse candidate in the 1844 presidential election as the Democratic Party nominee; he entered his party's convention as a potential nominee for vice president but emerged as a compromise to head the ticket when no presidential candidate could gain the necessary two-thirds majority. In the general election, Polk narrowly defeated Henry Clay of the Whig Party and pledged to serve only one term.\nAfter a negotiation fraught with the risk of war, Polk reached a settlement with Great Britain over the disputed Oregon Country, with the territory for the most part divided along the 49th parallel. He oversaw victory in the Mexican\u2013American War, resulting in Mexico's cession of the entire American Southwest. He secured a substantial reduction of tariff rates with the Walker tariff of 1846. The same year, he achieved his other major goal, reestablishment of the Independent Treasury system. True to his campaign pledge to serve one term (one of the few U.S. presidents to make and keep such a pledge), Polk left office in 1849 and returned to Tennessee, where he died of cholera soon afterward.\nThough he is relatively obscure today, scholars have ranked Polk in the upper tier of American presidents, mostly for his ability to promote and achieve the major items on his presidential agenda. At the same time, he has been criticized for leading the country into a war with Mexico that exacerbated sectional divides. A property owner who used slave labor, he kept a plantation in Mississippi and increased his slave ownership during his presidency. Polk's policy of territorial expansion saw the nation reach the Pacific coast and almost all its contiguous borders. He helped make the U.S. a nation poised to become a world power, but with divisions between free and slave states gravely exacerbated, setting the stage for the Civil War.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nJames Knox Polk was born on November 2, 1795, in a log cabin in Pineville, North Carolina. He was the first of 10 children born into a family of farmers. His mother Jane named him after her father, James Knox. His father Samuel Polk was a farmer, slaveholder, and surveyor of Scots-Irish descent. The Polks had immigrated to America in the late 17th century, settling initially on the Eastern Shore of Maryland but later moving to south-central Pennsylvania and then to the Carolina hill country.\nThe Knox and Polk families were Presbyterian. While Polk's mother remained a devout Presbyterian, his father, whose own father Ezekiel Polk was a deist, rejected dogmatic Presbyterianism. He refused to declare his belief in Christianity at his son's baptism, and the minister refused to baptize young James. Nevertheless, James' mother \"stamped her rigid orthodoxy on James, instilling lifelong Calvinistic traits of self-discipline, hard work, piety, individualism, and a belief in the imperfection of human nature\", according to James A. Rawley's American National Biography article.\nIn 1803, Ezekiel Polk led four of his adult children and their families to the Duck River area in what is now Maury County, Tennessee; Samu", "metadata": {"title": "James Buchanan", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Buchanan"}}
