Terrorism is violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/or groups to further ideological goals stemming from influences, such as those of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature. Within the US, an all-hazards approach exists regarding homeland security endeavors. In this sense, homeland security encompasses both natural disasters and man-made events. Thus, the domain of homeland security must accommodate a plethora of situations and scenarios, ranging from natural disasters (e.g., Hurricane Katrina, Irma) to acts of terrorism (e.g., Boston Marathon bombing, September 11 attacks).\nThe term came about following enactment of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and reorganization of many U.S. government civil agencies effective March 1, 2003, to form the United States Department of Homeland Security after the September 11 attacks, and may refer to the actions of that department, the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, or the United States House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security.\nThe term, \"Homeland Security\" is not to be confused with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In its February 15, 2001 report, the U.S. Commission on National Security/21st Century, said the United States must change how it operates in the area of homeland security. The report recommended the creation of what was ultimately called the Department of Homeland Security.\"\nDHS was formed by the Homeland security Act of 2002. The term, homeland security, is not the same as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS is an executive  branch agency. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on Homeland Security are both legislative bodies, and thus are clearly distinct from the executive agency, DHS. The actions of these two legislative bodies are not the same as actions of DHS.\nHomeland defense (HD) is the military protection of U.S. territory, sovereignty, domestic population, and critical infrastructure against external threats and aggression.\n\n\n== Definition ==\n\"Despite the [published] definition, mission statement, and vision [all of which have changed since 9/11], there is no consensus among practitioners and the public as to what the term Homeland Security actually means. Different groups view it differently. The extremes of opinion are represented, for the narrow view, by those who feel homeland security is only about terrorism. They believe focusing on anything additional dilutes, distracts, and weakens the homeland security mission.\"\nOthers say its focus is terrorism and natural disasters. Still others claim homeland security is about 'all hazards' (terrorism, man-made disasters, and natural disasters). To some, homeland security is focused on 'jurisdictional hazards' (i.e. homeland security means different things to different jurisdictions depending upon that jurisdiction's particular hazards, risks, and level of preparedness). Examples of some of the jurisdictional hazards include hurricanes, tornados, flooding, and earthquakes. At the other extreme, the broad view of homeland security advocates that homeland security is about everything \u2013 that it implicates almost every sector.\"\n\n\n== In the United States ==\n\nFollowing the emergency response to Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and Hurrica\nThe Homeland Security Council (HSC) is an entity within the Executive Office of the President of the United States tasked with advising the president on matters relevant to Homeland Security. The current Homeland Security Advisor is Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Homeland Security Council (HSC) is an entity within the Executive Office of the President and was created by Executive Order 13228 on October 29, 2001, and subsequently expanded on by Homeland Security Presidential Directive 1.  It served as the successor to the Office of Homeland Security, established on September 20, 2001, immediately after the September 11 attacks. Congress subsequently codified the HSC in the Homeland Security Act of 2002, charging it with advising the president on homeland security matters.\nOn February 23, 2009, the Obama administration released Presidential Study Directive 1. This memorandum ordered a 60-day inter-agency review of the White House homeland security and counter-terrorism structure. The review recommended that the president merge the staff supporting the Homeland Security Council with the staff supporting the National Security Council. On May 26, 2009, Barack Obama signed the recommendation to merge the Homeland Security Council and National Security Council staffs into one National Security Staff. On February 10, 2014, President Obama renamed the National Security Staff the National Security Council (NSC) staff.\nPolicymakers and observers have debated whether the HSC staff should remain an independent entity within the White House or merged with the NSC staff. The HSC and NSC continue to exist by statute as independent councils of leadership advising the president.\n\n\n== Mission ==\nThe Homeland Security Council is responsible for assessing the objectives, commitments, and risks of the United States, and for making recommendations to the president with respect to homeland security policy.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe HSC was similar to its national security counterpart, the National Security Council (NSC), which was established in the National Security Act of 1947. The HSC also maintained structural similarities with the NSC; the HSC consisted of full-time staff organized by subject areas relating to homeland security missions, with the Council itself being composed of Cabinet members and senior White House officials whose departments have principal interests in homeland security policy-making. During the Bush administration, the council was chaired by the Homeland Security Advisor. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consist of the primary military advisers to the Homeland Security Council, as well as the National Security Council. Due to the recommendations implemented by Obama, the Homeland Security Council and the National Security Council now have combined staff, the National Security Staff (NSS).\nWhile similar in name, the Department of Homeland Security is a distinct federal executive department; unlike DHS, the HSC functioned as part of the Executive Office of the President, drawing staff from across federal agencies and under the direct control of the president.\n\n\n== Membership ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nHomeland Security Advisor\nNational Security Advisor\nUnited States National Security Council\n\n\n== References ==\nThe United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the U.S. federal executive department responsible for public security, roughly comparable to the interior or home ministries of other countries. Its stated missions involve anti-terrorism, border security, immigration and customs, cyber security, and disaster prevention and management.\nIt began operations on March 1, 2003, after being formed as a result of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, enacted in response to the September 11 attacks. With more than 240,000 employees, DHS is the third-largest Cabinet department, after the departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs. Homeland security policy is coordinated at the White House by the Homeland Security Council. Other agencies with significant homeland security responsibilities include the departments of Health and Human Services, Justice, and Energy.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Creation ===\n\nIn response to the September 11 attacks, President George W. Bush announced the establishment of the Office of Homeland Security (OHS) to coordinate \"homeland security\" efforts. The office was headed by former Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge, who assumed the title of Assistant to the President for Homeland Security. The official announcement states:\n\nThe mission of the Office will be to develop and coordinate the implementation of a comprehensive national strategy to secure the United States from terrorist threats or attacks. The Office will coordinate the executive branch's efforts to detect, prepare for, prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks within the United States.\nRidge began his duties as OHS director on October 8, 2001. On November 25, 2002, the Homeland Security Act established the Department of Homeland Security to consolidate U.S. executive branch organizations related to \"homeland security\" into a single Cabinet agency. The Gilmore Commission, supported by much of Congress and John Bolton, helped to solidify further the need for the department. The DHS incorporated the following 22 agencies.\n\n\n=== List of incorporated agencies ===\n\nAccording to political scientist Peter Andreas, the creation of DHS constituted the most significant government reorganization since the Cold War and the most substantial reorganization of federal agencies since the National Security Act of 1947 (which had placed the different military departments under a secretary of defense and created the National Security Council and Central Intelligence Agency). Creation of DHS constitutes the most diverse merger ever of federal functions and responsibilities, incorporating 22 government agencies into a single organization. The founding of the DHS marked a change in American thought towards threats.\nIntroducing the term \"homeland\" centers attention on a population that needs to be protected not only against emergencies such as natural disasters but also against diffuse threats from individuals who are non-native to the United States.\nPrior to the signing of the bill, controversy about its adoption was focused on whether the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency should be incorporated in part or in whole (neither was included). The bill was also controversial for the presence of unrelated \"riders\", as well as for eliminating certain union-friendly civil service and labor protections for department employees. Without these protections, employees could be expeditiously reassigned or dismissed on grounds of security, incompetence or insubordination, and DHS would not be required to notify their union representatives. The plan stripped 180,000 government employees of their union rights. In 2002, Bush officials argued that the September 11 attacks made the proposed elimination of employee protections imperative.\n\nCongress ultimately passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, and President Bush signed the bill into law on November 25, 2002. It was the largest U.S. government reorganization in the 50 years\nAlejandro Nicolas Mayorkas (born November 24, 1959) is an American attorney and government official who is the 7th United States Secretary of Homeland Security, serving since 2021. A member of the Democratic Party, Mayorkas previously served as director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services from 2009 to 2013, and the 6th Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security from 2013 to 2016.\nMayorkas was born in Havana, Cuba. Shortly after the Cuban Revolution, his family fled to Florida and later settled in California. He graduated from UC Berkeley in history with honors, subsequently earning his J.D. from Loyola Marymount University. After law school, Mayorkas worked as an Assistant United States Attorney and as the United States attorney for the Central District of California in Los Angeles from 1998 to 2001. In 2009, Mayorkas was a member of the presidential transition team for Barack Obama, leading the team responsible for the U.S. Department of Justice's Criminal Division. He was appointed by President Obama as the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). As USCIS director, Mayorkas implemented the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) process in 60 days. He led U.S. government efforts to rescue orphaned children following the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti, and led the advancement of a crime victims unit that, for the first time, made it possible for the agency to issue the statutory maximum number of visas to victims of crime.\nOn November 23, 2020, Mayorkas was nominated by President-elect Joe Biden for the position of Secretary of Homeland Security. Mayorkas's nomination received the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police and several former secretaries. He was confirmed by the Senate on a 56\u201343 vote on February 2, 2021, facing significant Republican opposition over his stance on immigration, particularly his support for halting border wall construction and advocating for a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. He was sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris the same day.\nSince Alejandro Mayorkas became Secretary of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection has reported about 10 million nationwide encounters with removable noncitizens across the country. This includes a record 2.2 million encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal year 2022, the highest in history. Additionally, 1.5 million \"gotaways\"\u2014people who evaded capture\u2014were estimated to have entered the U.S. during this period.\nMayorkas' tenure has drawn sharp criticism from Republicans, leading to his impeachment for dereliction of duty in a narrow and largely partisan 214\u2013213 vote by the House of Representatives in 2024. This came after an unsuccessful impeachment vote of Mayorkas one week prior. Mayorkas is the first cabinet member to be impeached since William Belknap in 1876. The Senate voted 51\u201349 to dismiss the impeachment charges on April 17, ending the impeachment without a trial.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nAlejandro Nicholas Mayorkas was born in Havana, Cuba, on November 24, 1959. When he was one year old, his parents fled with him and his sister to the United States in 1960 as refugees, following the Cuban Revolution. He lived in Miami, Florida, before his family moved to Los Angeles, California, where he was raised for the remainder of his youth. Mayorkas grew up in Beverly Hills and attended Beverly Hills High School.\nHis father, Charles R. \"Nicky\" Mayorkas, was born in Cuba. He was a Cuban Jew of Sephardi (from the former Ottoman Empire, present-day Turkey and Greece) and Ashkenazi (from Poland) background. He owned and operated a steel wool factory on the outskirts of Havana. Nicky Mayorkas studied economics at Dartmouth College.\nHis mother, Anita (Gabor), was a Romanian Jew whose family escaped the Holocaust and fled to Cuba in the 1940s before leaving for the United States after the Cuban Revolution.\nMayorkas graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1981 with \nKirstjen Michele Nielsen (; born May 14, 1972) is an American attorney who served as United States Secretary of Homeland Security from 2017 to 2019.

The firm's online profile listed her as its only employee, with the firm's phone number being Nielsen's personal cellphone. In September 2013 the company won a federal contract, with an initial award of about $450,000, to \"provide policy and legislation, technical writing, and organizational development\" to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\nNielsen was a senior member of the Resilience Task Force of the Center for Cyber & Homeland Security Committee at George Washington University and served on the Global Risks Report Advisory Board of the World Economic Forum.\n\n\n== Initial positions in the Trump administration ==\nNielsen served as John F.

In early September 2017, just over a month after Kelly became White House chief of staff on July 31, 2017, Nielsen moved to the White House, becoming the principal deputy chief of staff under Kelly.\n\n\n== Secretary of Homeland Security ==\n\n\n=== Nomination ===\n\nOn October 11, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Nielsen to be the new United States secretary of homeland security, replacing acting secretary Elaine Duke. On December 5, 2017, the Senate confirmed her nomination, by a 62\u201337 vote. On December 6, 2017, she was sworn in as secretary of homeland security.\n\n\n=== Tenure ===\nOn January 16, 2018, Nielsen testified before the United States Senate in favor of merit, rather than family, based immigration. She was questioned about an earlier meeting at the White House in which press reports and Senator Dick Durbin related that the president had used the word \"shithole\" to describe African countries, as well as disparaging remarks about Haiti. Nielsen said, \"I did not hear that word used, no sir,\" although she said she heard \"tough language\" that was impassioned. During the same hearing, Senator Patrick Leahy asked her whether Norway was a predominantly white country. Nielsen appeared to hesitate before answering with, \"I actually do not know that, sir.\" She added, \"But I imagine that is the case.\" Nielsen was criticized by Senator Cory Booker for not recalling or speaking out against Trump's disparaging remarks \nJeh Charles Johnson ( \"Jay\"; born September 11, 1957) is an American lawyer and former government official.

Ketcham High School in 1975. He described himself as \"a big underachiever\", earning grades of C and D in school until he went on to college, citing the fact that he didn't \"have a lot of African-American role models\" in what was a mostly white community. It was during his sophomore year in college that a vision of becoming an attorney led him to work to increase his \"GPA above a dismal 1.8\".\nJohnson is a graduate of Morehouse College (B.A.) and Columbia Law School (J.D.). He is the recipient of thirteen honorary degrees.\n\n\n== Early career ==\n\n\n=== Private practice and federal prosecutor ===\nJohnson began as an associate at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison in November 1984, then left in 1989 \nto serve as an assistant United States Attorney in the public corruption section at the Southern District of New York.

The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-53) was enacted on August 7, 2007 and reorganized intelligence operations at DHS, elevating the Assistant Secretary to the Under Secretary level.\nWith the rank of Under Secretary, the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis is a Level III position within the Executive Schedule. Since January 2022, the annual rate of pay for Level III is $187,300.\n\n\n== Reporting officials ==\nAs head of the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis, officials reporting to the Under Secretary include:\n\nPrincipal Deputy Under Secretary of Intelligence and Analysis\nDeputy Under Secretary for Intelligence Enterprise Operations\nDeputy Under Secretary for Intelligence Enterprise Readiness\n\n\n== Officeholders ==\n\n\n== References ==\nThe Homeland Security Act (HSA) of 2002, (Pub. L. 107\u2013296 (text) (PDF), 116 Stat. 2135, enacted November 25, 2002) was introduced in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks and subsequent mailings of anthrax spores. The HSA was cosponsored by 118 members of Congress. The act passed the U.S. Senate by a vote of 90\u20139, with one Senator not voting. It was signed into law by President George W. Bush in November 2002.\nHSA created the United States Department of Homeland Security and the new cabinet-level position of Secretary of Homeland Security. It is the largest federal government reorganization since the Department of Defense was created via the National Security Act of 1947 (as amended in 1949).   It also includes many of the organizations under which the powers of the USA PATRIOT Act are exercised.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe new department assumed a large number of services, offices and other organizations previously conducted in other departments, such as the Customs Service, Coast Guard, and U.S. Secret Service.  It superseded, but did not replace, the Office of Homeland Security, which retained an advisory role.  The Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2004 provided the new department its first funding. A major reason for the implementation of HSA is to ensure that the border function remains strong within the new Department.\nThe Act is similar to the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA) in reorganizing and centralizing Federal security functions to meet post\u2013Cold War threats and challenges. Like IRTPA, there are some inherent contradictions in the bill not solved by reorganization.  These reflect compromises with other committees needed to secure passage, but the result is at times inconsistent or conflicting authorities.  For example, the Act identifies the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) first responsibility as preventing terrorist attacks in the United States; but, the law's language makes clear that investigation and prosecution of terrorism remains with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and assigns DHS only an analytical and advisory role in intelligence activities.  Similarly, with Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP), which relates to the preparedness and response to serious incidents, the Act gave DHS broad responsibility to minimize damage but only limited authority to share information and to coordinate the development of private sector best practices.\n\n\n== Establishments ==\nThe Homeland Security Act of 2002 is the foundation for many other establishments, including:\n\nthe Department of Homeland Security, which is headed by the Secretary of Homeland Security\nan established Directorate for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection within the Department of Homeland Security, which is headed by the Under Secretary for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection.\nthe Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002\nthe Cyber Security Enhancement Act of 2002\n\n\n== Titles ==\nThe Homeland Security Act of 2002 documented under Public Law is divided into 17 titles that establishes the Department of Homeland Security and other purposes. Each title is broken down into several sections, summarized below.\n\n1. Department of Homeland Security\nTitle I consists of three sections that establish the Department of Homeland Security, which carries out several missions that comply with the United States Code.\n2. Information Analysis And Infrastructure Protection\nTitle II consists of two subtitles, including the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002, and nineteen sections, including the Cyber Security Enhancement Act of 2002. It is headed by the Under Secretary and used to access, receive and analyze law enforcement information, intelligence information, and other information from federal, state, and local government agencies for further use towards the prevention of terrorist acts.\n3.

His appointment was ruled unlawful in November 2020. Wolf was also the under secretary of homeland security for strategy, policy, and plans from 2019 to 2021.\nA member of the Republican Party, Wolf previously served in several positions in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including as chief of staff of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and chief of staff to DHS secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. From 2005 to 2016, he was a lobbyist, helping clients secure contracts from TSA. Wolf was an architect of the Trump administration family separation policy in 2018, and was prominently involved in the deployment of federal law enforcement forces in Portland and elsewhere beginning in July 2020. \nIn September 2020, a whistleblower accused him of having ordered staff to stop reporting on threats from Russia.  In November 2020, District Judge Nicholas Garaufis ruled Wolf's appointment unlawful, and overturned a set of Wolf's orders as \"not an exercise of legal authority\". Wolf resigned his post on January 11, 2021, after a number of similar court rulings.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWolf was born to James B. (Jim) Wolf and Cinda Thompson Wolf in Jackson, Mississippi. He grew up in Plano, Texas. He graduated from Plano East Senior High School and then attended Collin College on a tennis scholarship. He then transferred to Southern Methodist University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in history.\nIn 2013, he received a professional non-credit certificate in contract management from Villanova University in Villanova, Pennsylvania. \n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Congressional staff ===\nWolf worked as a staffer for Republican Senators Phil Gramm, Kay Bailey Hutchison, and then for two and a half years with Chuck Hagel. From 2002 to 2005, he worked in the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), becoming Assistant Administrator for Transportation Security Policy in 2005. It was during this time he first worked with Kirstjen Nielsen.\n\n\n=== Lobbyist ===\nFrom October 2005 to 2016, Wolf was vice president and senior director at Wexler & Walker, a now defunct lobbying firm. He helped clients obtain contracts from the TSA, his previous employer.\n\n\n=== Trump administration ===\nIn March 2017, Wolf became chief of staff at the Transportation Security Administration. He served in that position for four months, then became Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Deputy Chief of Staff and the top aide to Deputy Secretary Elaine Duke.\nIn July 2017, Wolf became chief of staff to DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. While working for Nielsen, he was an early architect of the family separation policy. Under questioning from Senator Jacky Rosen, Wolf later testified to Congress that he was not involved in the policy's development and that his function was to provide information to Nielsen and \"not to determine whether it was the right or wrong policy\". A government watchdog group disputed this statement based on internal documents. Wolf has said he \"supported the President's decision when he issued an executive order to stop that practice\".\nWolf then became Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for Strategy, Plans, Analysis and Risk, a Senior Executive Service position not subject to Senate confirmation. He concurrently served as Acting Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Strategy, Policy, and Plans. He was nominated in February 2019 to serve permanently as Under Secretary, and his confirmation hearing was held that June. Senator Jacky Rosen delayed the nomination to protest poor conditions for children at DHS facilities.\n\n\n=== Acting Secretary of Homeland Security ===\nWolf began serving as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security in November 2019.

Bush. Chertoff also served for one additional day under President Barack Obama. He was the co-author of the USA PATRIOT Act. Chertoff previously served as a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, as a federal prosecutor, and as Assistant U.S. Attorney General. He succeeded Tom Ridge as U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security on February 15, 2005.\nSince leaving government service, he co-founded the Chertoff Group, a risk-management and security consulting company. He has also worked as senior of counsel at the Washington, D.C., law firm of Covington & Burling. He is also the chair and a member of the board of trustees in the international freedom watchdog Freedom House, and sits on the bipartisan advisory board of States United Democracy Center.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMichael Chertoff was born to Gershon Baruch Chertoff (1915\u201396), a rabbi and Talmudic scholar who was the leader of Congregation B'nai Israel in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and Livia Chertoff (n\u00e9e Eisen), a Polish\u2013born Israeli American who was the first flight attendant for El Al. His paternal grandparents are Paul Chertoff, a rabbi and professor of Talmud, and Esther Barish Chertoff.\nChertoff attended the Jewish Educational Center in Elizabeth as well as the Pingry School. He graduated from Harvard College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1975. During his sophomore year, he studied abroad at the London School of Economics and Political Science. He then attended Harvard Law School, where he worked as a research assistant for John Hart Ely on his book Democracy and Distrust. Chertoff received a Juris Doctor, magna cum laude, in 1978.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFollowing his law school graduation, Chertoff served as a law clerk to Judge Murray Gurfein of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and later for United States Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. from 1979 to 1980.\nChertoff worked in private practice with Latham & Watkins from 1980 to 1983 before being hired as a prosecutor by Rudolph Giuliani, then the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Chertoff worked on Mafia and political corruption\u2013related cases. In the mid-1990s, Chertoff returned to Latham & Watkins for a brief period, founding the firm's office in Newark, New Jersey.\nIn September 1986, together with United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York Rudolph Giuliani, Chertoff was instrumental in the crackdown on organized crime in the Mafia Commission Trial.\nIn 1990, Chertoff was appointed by President George H. W. Bush as United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey. Among his most important cases, in 1992 Chertoff achieved conviction of second-term Jersey City mayor Gerald McCann on charges of defrauding money from a savings and loan scam. McCann served two years in federal prison.\nIn 1993, he was a prosecutor in the fraud case against Eddie Antar, founder of the Crazy Eddie electronics store chain.\n\nChertoff was asked to stay in his position when the Clinton administration took office in 1993, at the request of Democratic Senator Bill Bradley. He was the only United States Attorney who was not replaced due to the change in administrations. He continued to work with the U.S. Attorney's office until 1994, when he entered private practice, returning to Latham & Watkins as a partner.\nDespite his friendly relationship with some Democrats, Chertoff was appointed as the special counsel for the Senate Whitewater Committee studying allegations against President Clinton and his wife in what was known as the Whitewater investigation. No charges were brought against the Clintons.\nIn 2000, Chertoff worked as special counsel to the New Jersey Senate Judiciary Committee, investigating racial profiling in New Jersey.

Its responsibilities include U.S. security legislation and oversight of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\n== Role of the committee ==\nThe committee conducts oversight and handles legislation (and resolutions) related to the security of the United States. The committee may amend, approve, or table homeland security related bills. It also has the power to hold hearings, conduct investigations, and subpoena witnesses. Additionally, the committee has authorization and policy oversight responsibilities over the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\n== Rules of the committee ==\nThe committee meets on the first Wednesday of each month while the House is in session. It is not permitted to conduct business unless a quorum is present, which the rules define as one third of its members. A majority of members are required for certain actions including: issuing a subpoena, entering executive session, and immunizing a witness. Committee members have access to classified information but must adhere to stringent access control procedures.\n\n\n== History of the committee ==\nIn the 109th Congress, the House Select Committee on Homeland Security was established on June 19, 2002, pursuant to H. Res. 449 (adopted by voice vote). The committee was composed of nine members of the House: Mr. Armey, chairman; Mr. DeLay; Mr. Watts of Oklahoma; Ms. Pryce of Ohio; Mr. Portman; Ms. Pelosi; Mr. Frost; Mr. Menendez; and Ms. DeLauro.\nThe mandate of the Select Committee in the 107th Congress was to \u201cdevelop recommendations and report to the House on such matters that relate to the establishment of a department of homeland security.\u201d The Select Committee accomplished its mandate on November 22, 2002, when the House concurred in the Senate amendment to H.R. 5005 by unanimous consent and cleared H.R. 5005 for the President. The bill was presented to the President on November 22, 2002, and was signed on November 25, 2002, becoming Public Law number 107-296, the \"Homeland Security Act of 2002\".\nThe termination date of the House Select Committee on Homeland Security was \u201cafter final disposition of a bill including the final disposition of any veto message on such bill,\u201d which occurred on November 25, 2002.\nThe second select committee was formed in 2003 at the beginning of the 108th Congress as a select committee with Rep. Christopher Cox of California as its chairman and Jim Turner of Texas as its ranking member. The creation of the committee was necessitated by the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. As an executive branch department, the newly formed Department of Homeland Security required congressional counterparts to facilitate legislative action and oversight.\nThe committee was made permanent when it was elevated to standing status by a vote of the House of Representatives on January 4, 2005, on the opening day of the 109th Congress, again with Rep. Chris Cox as its first permanent chairman. Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi was the committee's first permanent ranking member. After Chairman Cox resigned from Congress in July 2005 to become the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Rep. Peter King of New York served as chairman for the remainder of the 109th Congress.\nAs Congress switched parties at the beginning of the 110th Congress, Rep. Thompson became the chairman of the committee and Rep. King the ranking member. House control switched parties again at the beginning of the 112th Congress in 2011, and King again became the chairman, and Thompson the ranking member. As the House switched parties at the beginning of the 116th Congress, Thompson again assumed the chair. The committee continues to operate in a bipartisan manner, passing almost all of its legislation out of the committee unanimously.\n\n\n== Hearings ==\n\n\n=== Airport computed tomography (CT) scanners ===\nIn November 2017, the full Homeland Security Comm\nThe Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, commonly referred to as the Homeland Security Advisor and formerly the Deputy National Security Advisor for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, is a senior aide in the National Security Council, based in the West Wing of the White House, who serves as principal advisor to the President of the United States on homeland security and counterterrorism issues.\nThe Homeland Security Advisor is also a statutory member of the United States Homeland Security Council. Serving at the pleasure of the President, the Homeland Security Advisor does not require Senate confirmation for appointment to the office.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks, President George W. Bush announced the creation of the interim Office of Homeland Security as a cabinet-level office in a speech to a joint session of Congress. He appointed Tom Ridge as its first director. The Homeland Security Council was formally created on October 5, 2001, replacing the Office of Homeland Security.\nUnder the George W. Bush administration, the Homeland Security Advisor was independent of the National Security Council, residing within the Homeland Security Council. Under the Obama administration, while the Homeland Security Council remained, the Advisor held the title of Deputy National Security Advisor for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, subordinating the position to the National Security Advisor.\nAt the start of the Trump administration, the position of Homeland Security Advisor, occupied by Tom Bossert, was elevated to the rank of Assistant to the President, making it equal in rank to the National Security Advisor. However, after clashes with the National Security Advisor, John Bolton, the position returned to the rank of Deputy Assistant to the President and was subordinate to the National Security Advisor.\n\n\n== List of Homeland Security Advisors ==\n  Democratic\n  Republican\n  Independent\n\n\n=== Titles ===\nAssistant to the President for Homeland Security (September 20, 2001 \u2013 July 28, 2004)\nAssistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism (July 28, 2004 \u2013 January 20, 2009)\nDeputy National Security Advisor for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism (January 20, 2009 \u2013 January 20, 2017)\nAssistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism (January 20, 2017 \u2013 May 31, 2018)\nDeputy Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism (June 1, 2018 \u2013 January 20, 2021)\nAssistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor and Deputy National Security Advisor (January 20, 2021 \u2013 present)\n\n\n== See also ==\nExecutive Office of the President\n\n\n== References ==\nThe assistant to the president for national security affairs (APNSA), commonly referred to as the national security advisor (NSA), is a senior aide in the Executive Office of the President, based at the West Wing of the White House. The national security advisor serves as the principal advisor to the president of the United States on all national security issues. The national security advisor participates in meetings of the National Security Council (NSC) and usually chairs meetings of the principals committee of the NSC with the secretary of state and secretary of defense (those meetings not attended by the president). The NSA also sits on the Homeland Security Council (HSC). The national security advisor is supported by NSC staff who produce classified research and briefings for the national security advisor to review and present, either to the NSC or the president. The national security advisor is appointed by the president and does not require confirmation by the United States Senate. An appointment of a three- or four-star general to the role requires Senate confirmation to maintain that rank in the new position.\n\n\n== Role ==\nThe influence and role of the national security advisor varies from administration to administration and depends not only on the qualities of the person appointed to the position, but also on the style and management philosophy of the incumbent president. Ideally, the national security advisor serves as an honest broker of policy options for the president in the field of national security, rather than as an advocate for his or her own policy agenda.\nThe national security advisor is a staff position in the Executive Office of the President and does not have line or budget authority over either the Department of State or the Department of Defense, unlike the secretary of state and the secretary of defense, who are Senate-confirmed officials with statutory authority over their departments. The national security advisor is able to offer daily advice (due to the proximity) to the president independently of the vested interests of the large bureaucracies and clientele of those departments.\nIn times of crisis, the national security advisor is likely to operate from the White House Situation Room or the Presidential Emergency Operations Center (as on September 11, 2001), updating the president on the latest events in a crisis situation.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe National Security Council was created at the start of the Cold War under the National Security Act of 1947 to coordinate defense, foreign affairs, international economic policy, and intelligence; this was part of a large reorganization that saw the creation of the Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency. The Act did not create the position of the national security advisor per se, but it did create an executive secretary in charge of the staff. In 1949, the NSC became part of the Executive Office of the President.\nRobert Cutler was the first national security advisor in 1953, and held the job twice, both times during the Eisenhower administration. The system has remained largely unchanged since then, particularly since President John Kennedy, with powerful national security advisors and strong staff but a lower importance given to formal NSC meetings. This continuity persists despite the tendency of each new president to replace the advisor and senior NSC staff.\nPresident Richard Nixon's national security advisor, Henry Kissinger, enhanced the importance of the role, controlling the flow of information to the president and meeting with him multiple times per day. Kissinger also holds the distinction of serving as national security advisor and secretary of state at the same time from September 22, 1973, until November 3, 1975. He holds the record for longest term of service (2,478 days); Michael Flynn holds the record for shortest term, at just 24 days.\nBrent Scowcroft held the job in two non-consecutive administrations: the Ford administr\nThe Seal of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is the symbol of the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and is used to represent the organization and authenticate certain official documents.\nThe seal was developed with input from senior DHS leadership, employees, and the U.S. Commission on Fine Arts. The Ad Council, which partners with DHS on its Ready.gov campaign, and the consulting company Landor Associates were responsible for graphic design and maintaining heraldic integrity. The seal is also featured on the DHS flag, which consists of the seal itself emblazoned on a blue background.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security was formed in November 2002, succeeding the U.S. Office of Homeland Security (OHS), which was created in October 2001 in response to the September 11 attacks. Whereas the OHS was a subsidiary office of the Executive Office of the President (EOP), the DHS is an independent, cabinet-level department.\nFrom the creation of the agency in late 2002 until the adoption of a dedicated departmental seal in 2003, the DHS utilized a slightly-modified version of the U.S. great seal.\nThe seal was developed with input from senior DHS leadership, employees, and the U.S. Commission on Fine Arts. The Ad Council, which partners with DHS on its Ready.gov campaign, and the consulting company Landor Associates were responsible for graphic design and maintaining heraldic integrity. The seal is also featured on the DHS flag, which consists of the seal itself emblazoned on a blue background.\nThe colors of the seal are specified as \"Homeland Security Blue\", specified as 2955 C on the Pantone Matching System, \"Homeland Security Gray\", specified as Cool Gray 6 C on the Pantone Matching System, \"Homeland Security Red\", specified as 187 C on the Pantone Matching System, \"Homeland Security Light Blue\", specified as 307 C on the Pantone Matching System, and \"Homeland Security Green\", specified as 370 C on the Pantone Matching System.\nIn June 2003, several months after the DHS was created, the DHS seal was unveiled. A DHS press release dated June 19, 2003 describes the seal as follows:\n\nThe seal is symbolic of the Department's mission \u2013 to prevent attacks and protect Americans \u2013 on the land, in the sea and in the air. In the center of the seal, a graphically styled white American eagle appears in a circular blue field. The eagle's outstretched wings break through an inner red ring into an outer white ring that contains the words \"U.S. DEPARTMENT OF\" in the top half and \"HOMELAND SECURITY\" in the bottom half in a circular placement.\nThe eagle's wings break through the inner circle into the outer ring to suggest that the Department of Homeland Security will break through traditional bureaucracy and perform government functions differently. In the tradition of the Great Seal of the United States, the eagle's talon on the left holds an olive branch with 13 leaves and 13 seeds while the eagle's talon on the right grasps 13 arrows.\n\nCentered on the eagle's breast is a shield divided into three sections containing elements that represent the American homeland \u2013 air, land, and sea. The top element, a dark blue sky, contains 22 stars representing the original 22 entities that have come together to form the department. The left shield element contains white mountains behind a green plain underneath a light blue sky. The right shield element contains four wave shapes representing the oceans alternating light and dark blue separated by white lines.\nThe seal is prominently featured on the organizational flag of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which consists of the seal on a rectangular blue background of Pantone #2955C.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security Seal and Signature Usage Guidelines\nThe Director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is a civilian official in the United States Department of Homeland Security.

From 2004 to 2006 he was Commander of the First Coast Guard District/Maritime Defense Command One headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n\n=== Vice-commandant ===\nVice Admiral Pekoske served as vice commandant of the United States Coast Guard from August 7, 2009 to May 24, 2010. As second in command to Admiral Thad Allen and COO, Pekoske executed the commandant's strategic intent, managed internal organizational governance and served as the component acquisition executive.\n\n\n== TSA administrator ==\nOn June 5, 2017, President Donald Trump announced that he had nominated Pekoske as the seventh Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration.\nOn August 3, 2017, Pekoske was confirmed by the United States Senate as the next TSA administrator. On August 10, 2017, he was sworn in as TSA's seventh administrator. On May 6, 2022, Pekoske was nominated to a second five-year term by President Joe Biden. On September 15, 2022, Pekoske was confirmed by the Senate by a 77-18 vote. In the interim, Pekoske reverted to an acting status.\n\n\n=== Acting deputy secretary of homeland security ===\n\nOn April 11, 2019, Pekoske was designated as the senior official performing the duties of the deputy secretary by Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan, making him the acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Pekoske remained the TSA Administrator, but day-to-day operations of TSA were overseen by TSA's acting deputy administrator, Patricia Cogswell.\nOn November 13, 2019, with the appointment of Ken Cuccinelli as Acting Deputy Secretary, Pekoske returned to his duties as TSA Administrator.\nFollowin\nKevin Kealoha McAleenan (born September 5, 1971) is an American attorney and government official who unlawfully served as the acting United States secretary of homeland security from April to November 2019.\nMcAleenan served as the U.S. Customs and Border Protection commissioner from March 2018 to May 2019. During that time, he was a leading proponent of separating children from their parents as a means of deterring illegal entry into the United States. President Donald Trump designated McAleenan as Acting United States Secretary of Homeland Security in April 2019. He resigned on October 11, 2019, with Trump saying McAleenan wanted to \"spend more time with his family and go to the private sector.\" The Government Accountability Office later ruled that McAleenan's appointment as Acting Secretary had been improper.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nKevin McAleenan was born on September 5, 1971, in Honolulu, Hawaii, to a mother of Finnish descent and a father of Irish descent. He received an undergraduate degree from Amherst College. He then received a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Chicago Law School and practiced law in the state of California.\n\n\n== Early career ==\n\nMcAleenan practiced law in the private sector from 1998 until 2001, when terrorist attacks that September motivated him to apply to work for the FBI. He was recruited to help start up the new CBP Office of Antiterrorism, eventually becoming its executive director.\nIn 2006, he became CBP's area director of Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). During his time as the port director of LAX, he was responsible for the security operations for that airport as well as 17 other airport facilities. After two years in private consulting, McAleenan returned to CBP in 2010, leading field operations. In 2011 McAleenan became the assistant commissioner of the Customs and Border Protection, Office of Field Operations. In this position he was in charge of airport operations and responsible for securing the US border while ensuring lawful trade and travel at 329 ports of entry in the United States, as well as 70 locations in more than 40 countries.\nMcAleenan served as deputy commissioner of Customs and Border Protection from 2014 to 2017.\n\n\n== Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection ==\n\n\n=== Nomination ===\nMcAleenan served as acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection from January 2017 to March 20, 2018.\nPresident Donald Trump nominated McAleenan to assume the position of commissioner in a permanent capacity in May 2017. McAleenan's previous nomination was supported by officials from both the George W. Bush and the Barack Obama administrations, a number of whom signed a letter to Congress expressing \"enthusiastic support\" for the \"supremely qualified\" McAleenan. Trump officially submitted the nomination to the Senate on May 22. The Senate confirmed McAleenan's nomination on March 19, 2018, by a vote of 77\u201319. He was sworn in on March 20, 2018.\n\n\n=== Tenure ===\nMcAleenan advocated for the implementation of the Trump administration's \"Zero Tolerance\" policy on immigration, including the prosecution of parents and the separation of children from their families. According to fifteen of his colleagues, he was one of the most vocal proponents of the policy within the administration. In April 2018, he issued a memorandum calling on Kirstjen Nielsen to begin enacting the policy, in spite of the fact that Nielsen believed that Border Patrol was not prepared to implement it.\nIn August 2018, McAleenan was interviewed by The New York Times and said he was aware that it is illegal to detain families longer than 90 days. He also said he felt Trump's executive order was an \"important recalibration\" and that \"well-intended efforts are not going to succeed if they lose public interest.\" McAleenan supports U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying it does \"critical work.\" He has said that there is no intent for indefinite or permanent family separation, and acknowledged \nThe United States National Security Council (NSC) is the principal forum used by the president of the United States for consideration of national security, military, and foreign policy matters. Based in the White House, it is part of the Executive Office of the President of the United States, and composed of senior national security advisors and Cabinet officials.\nSince its inception in 1947 by President Harry S. Truman, the function of the Council has been to advise and assist the president on national security and foreign policies. It also serves as the president's principal arm for coordinating these policies among various government agencies. The Council has subsequently played a key role in most major events in U.S. foreign policy, from the Korean War to the War on Terror.\nThe NSC has counterparts in the national security councils of many other nations.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe immediate predecessor to the National Security Council was the National Intelligence Authority (NIA), which was established by President Harry S. Truman's Executive Letter of January 22, 1946, to oversee the Central Intelligence Group, the CIA's predecessor. The NIA was composed of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, and the chief of staff to the commander in chief.\n\nThe National Security Council was created in 1947 by the National Security Act. It was created because policymakers felt that the diplomacy of the State Department was no longer adequate to contain the Soviet Union in light of the tension between the Soviet Union and the United States. The intent was to ensure coordination and concurrence among the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force and other instruments of national security policy such as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), also created in the National Security Act. In 2004, the position of Director of National Intelligence (DNI) was created, taking over the responsibilities previously held by the head of the CIA, the Director of Central Intelligence, as a cabinet-level position to oversee and coordinate activities of the Intelligence Community\n\nOn May 26, 2009, President Barack Obama merged the White House staff supporting the Homeland Security Council (HSC) and the National Security Council into one National Security Staff (NSS). The HSC and NSC each continue to exist by statute as bodies supporting the president. The name of the staff organization was changed back to National Security Council Staff in 2014.\nThe Directorate of Global Health Security and Biodefense was formed in 2016 under the Obama administration, disbanded in 2018 under the Trump Administration, and reinstated in January 2021 during the presidency of Joe Biden.\n\nOn January 29, 2017, President Donald Trump restructured the Principals Committee (a subset of the full National Security Council), while at the same time altering the attendance of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Director of National Intelligence.\nAccording to \"National Security Presidential Memorandum 2\", the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Director of National Intelligence were to only sit on the Principals Committee as and when matters pertaining to them arise, but will remain part of the full National Security Council. However, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus clarified the next day that they still are invited to attend meetings. With \"National Security Presidential Memorandum 4\" in April 2017, the Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \"shall\" attend Principals Committee meetings and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency was included as a regular attendee. The reorganization also placed the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development as a permanent member of the Deputies Committee, while the White House chief strategist was removed.\n\n\n== Authority and powers ==\nThe National Security Council was established by the National Security Act of 1947 (PL 235 \u2013 61 Stat. 496; \nSince 2004, Forbes, an American business magazine, has published an annual list of its ranking of the 100 most powerful women in the world.

He served as Deputy Homeland Security Advisor to the President of the United States during the Barack Obama administration. He also served as acting Secretary of Homeland Security following the resignation of Secretary Janet Napolitano on September 6, 2013 until Jeh Johnson assumed that office on December 23, 2013.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nBeers began his professional career as a Marine officer and rifle company commander in Vietnam (1964\u20131968). He entered the Foreign Service in 1971 and transferred to the Civil Service in 1983. He served most of his career in the Department of State, including as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Regional Affairs in the Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs, focusing on the Middle East and Persian Gulf (1992\u20131993). He was Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (1998\u20132002).\nBeers also served on the NSC Staff in the following capacies: Director for Counter-terrorism and Counter-narcotics (1988\u20131992), Director for Peacekeeping (1993\u20131995), and Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Intelligence Programs (1995\u20131998), and Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Combating Terrorism on the NSC Staff (2002\u20132003).\nHe resigned from the NSC Staff in March 2003, retired from government service in April 2003, and served as national security advisor for the Kerry-Edwards campaign (2003\u20132004).\n\n\n== John McCain controversy ==\nBeers stirred up controversy with remarks he made at an event hosted by the Center for American Progress in June 2008.  The event, dubbed \"McCain University,\" was a comprehensive effort to illustrate John McCain's policy proposals in the context of the 2008 Presidential Election.  During the question and answer portion of the event, Beers noted that \"his [John McCain's] national security experience [...] is sadly limited\" due to the fact that \"he was in isolation essentially for many of those years and did not experience the turmoil here or the challenges that were involved for those of us who served in Vietnam during the Vietnam war.\" McCain, a captured U.S. Navy aviator, was a prisoner of war of the North Vietnamese government for several years, and was repeatedly tortured.  Beers's comments elicited widespread criticism from conservative observers such as Rush Limbaugh and Karl Rove, as well as a variety of right-wing blogs.\n\n\n== Homeland Security career ==\nAs Under Secretary, Beers directed the Department's efforts to reduce risks to physical, cyber and communications infrastructures. NPPD collaborates with all levels of government, the private sector, non-government organizations, and international bodies to prevent, respond to, and mitigate threats to U.S. national security from acts of terrorism, natural disasters, and other catastrophic events.\nHe is a member of the National Infrastructure Advisory Council.\nBeers served as Counselor to Secretary Janet Napolitano beginning on January 21, 2009 and continued in that capacity while directing the activities of NPPD. Before his appointment, he was the co-leader of the Department of Homeland Security Transition Team for the incoming Obama administration. Prior to the 2008 election, Beers was president of the National Security Network, a Washington, D.C.-based foreign policy think tank he founded in 2006 to foster discussion of progressive national security ideas around the country, and an adjunct lecturer at Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University.\nBetween April and September in 2013, he was the acting United States Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security.\nFollowing Napolitano's resignation on September 6, 2013, Beers became acting United States Secretary of Homeland Security. His tenure ended when Jeh Johnson was confirmed as Napolitano's replacement by the United States Senate on December 23, 2013.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBeers earned a bachelor's degree from ", "metadata": {"title": "United States Secretary of Homeland Security", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_executive_departments#Former_departments"}}
