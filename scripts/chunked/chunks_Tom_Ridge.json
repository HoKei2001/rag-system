        "content": "Thomas Joseph Ridge (born August 26, 1945) is an American politician and author who served in the George W. Bush administration as the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security from 2001 to 2003 and as the United States Secretary of Homeland Security from 2003 to 2005. He was the first person to hold either office. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served in the United States House of Representatives from 1983 to 1995 and as the 43rd governor of Pennsylvania from 1995 to 2001.\nRidge was born in Munhall, Pennsylvania, and raised in veterans' public housing in Erie, Pennsylvania. After graduating from Harvard University with honors, he served in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War where he was awarded the Bronze Star. He then returned to Pennsylvania and completed his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree at the Dickinson School of Law, graduating in 1972, and entered private practice.\nAs assistant district attorney in Erie, Ridge ran for Congress in his district, where he served six terms. He then ran for governor in 1994, despite being little-known outside of northwest Pennsylvania. He won the election, and was reelected in 1998 with the most votes for a Republican governor in Pennsylvania (where Democrats outnumbered Republicans by almost 500,000) in more than half a century. As Governor of Pennsylvania, he is credited for statewide advances in economic development, education, health care and the environment. As of 2024, he is the last Republican to win reelection as Pennsylvania's governor.\nFollowing the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, U.S. President George W. Bush named Ridge the first director of the newly created Office of Homeland Security. In January 2003, the Office of Homeland Security became an official Cabinet-level Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and Ridge became the first Secretary of Homeland Security. He served in these roles for Bush's first term as president, then retired and returned to the private sector.\nSince reentering the private sector, Ridge has served on the boards of The Home Depot, The Hershey Company and Exelon Corporation and as a senior advisor to Deloitte & Touche and TechRadium. He is also the founder and chairman of Ridge Global, a Washington, D.C.-based security consulting firm. He spent time campaigning with Senator John McCain during his 2008 presidential bid and was believed by some to have been on the short list of potential running mates.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nRidge was born in Munhall, Pennsylvania, in Pittsburgh's Steel Valley, the eldest of three children. His parents were Laura (née Sudimack) and Thomas Regis Ridge, who was a traveling salesman and Navy veteran. Ridge's maternal grandparents were Rusyn immigrants from the former Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia), and his paternal great-grandparents emigrated from Great Britain. He was raised in veterans' public housing in Erie, Pennsylvania. He was educated at St. Andrews Elementary School and Cathedral Preparatory School and did well both academically and in sports. He attended Harvard College, where he paid his way through with construction work, played intramural baseball and football, and graduated with honors in 1967. In 1968, after his first year at the Dickinson School of Law, he was drafted into the United States Army.\n\n\n== Military service in Vietnam ==\nRidge waived an opportunity for officer training school because it would have required a longer service commitment. In November 1969, Ridge arrived as a sergeant in South Vietnam where he would serve for six months as a staff sergeant with Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry, 11th Infantry Brigade, 23rd Infantry Division (Americal Division) during the Vietnam War.\nIn May 1970, a ruptured appendix cut short his tour of duty in Vietnam and he was sent home; his service also aggravated a childhood ear infection which caused him afterwards to have a hearing aid in his left ear.\nFor his service in Vietnam, Ridge received the Bronze \nErie International Airport Tom Ridge Field (IATA: ERI, ICAO: KERI, FAA LID: ERI) is a public airport five miles (8.0 km) southwest of Erie, in Erie County, Pennsylvania, United States. Airline service at Erie faces stiff competition from the Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Buffalo, and Toronto airports, all within three hours of Erie by car. In 2004, Erie was the third-fastest-growing airport in the United States, and the fastest-growing airport in Pennsylvania. It is 128 miles (206 km) from Pittsburgh, 111 miles (179 km) from the Canada–U.S. border, 95 miles (153 km) from Cleveland, Ohio and 105 miles (169 km) from Buffalo, New York.\nThe airport is named for former Pennsylvania governor, former Secretary of United States Secretary of Homeland Security, and Erie native Tom Ridge.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nIn 1924, Roger Griswold purchased 22.12 acres (9.0 ha) of land 6 miles (10 km) west of Erie at the intersection of West Lake and Asbury Roads for use as an airfield. Soon after, a flight training school was based at the field. In 1927, as part of a nationwide tour by Charles Lindbergh after his transatlantic flight, Erie was selected as one of the cities where Lindbergh would make a brief stopover. Griswold Field proved inadequate for the larger Spirit of St. Louis and an alternative site could not be located, so a flyover by Lindbergh had to suffice.\nThis showed the need for a proper airport and prompted the Erie City Council to consider establishing a municipal airport. City Council was, initially, favoring a site 1⁄2-mile (0.8 km) east of Wesleyville for a municipal airport, but Lieutenant Jimmy Doolittle commented on the distance between it and the city; Doolittle noted that \"you might as well take 40 minutes more and go on to Cleveland.\" After recommendations made by Lindbergh to a Congressional committee that no airport less than 1 square mile (2.6 km2) be approved, the planning commission for Erie's airport began to reevaluate the site.\nGriswold Field officially closed in 1929 when Griswold moved to Long Island, but aircraft and the flight school continued to use it. That year two airfields were established: one on land next to the former Griswold Field, and another in Kearsarge that is now the site of the Millcreek Mall.\nAmerican Airlines began the airport's airline service June 15, 1938; American remained until 1953 when Allegheny replaced it. Pennsylvania-Central Airlines (later Capital) began service July 5, 1940. Mohawk arrived on December 1, 1956 and Lake Central on January 1, 1957; Capital Airlines flights ended in January 1961.\nPrior to September 11, 2001, the airport was at its height with US Airways mainline jets to Pittsburgh and international service to Toronto. After 9/11 US Airways replaced 737s and DC-9s with regional jets. As air service rebounded in the mid-2000s, US Airways Express flew to Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Charlotte; Northwest Airlink to Detroit; Continental Connection to Cleveland; and Delta Connection to Cincinnati and Atlanta. US Airways discontinued Charlotte flights in 2006. Delta Air Lines discontinued Atlanta flights on September 6, 2007. In early 2008 US Airways discontinued Pittsburgh flights.\nOn August 22, 2018, Derek Martin was named Executive Director of the airport.\nOn February 24, 2020, non-stop service to Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD) on United Express was announced. The service was made possible by a $292,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Small Community Air Service Development Program.\nOn June 5, 2020, Delta announced that it would indefinitely suspend service starting July 8 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n=== Current operations ===\nAs of June 2023, United has suspended all operations. The only air operations that remain are two departures and two arrivals per day by American Eagle using ERJ-145 aircraft.\n\n\n=== Runway extension ===\nThe 1,920-foot (590 m) extension of runway 6/24 was opened on November 8, 2012. The total cost of the proj\nThe United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the U.S. federal executive department responsible for public security, roughly comparable to the interior or home ministries of other countries. Its stated missions involve anti-terrorism, border security, immigration and customs, cyber security, and disaster prevention and management.\nIt began operations on March 1, 2003, after being formed as a result of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, enacted in response to the September 11 attacks. With more than 240,000 employees, DHS is the third-largest Cabinet department, after the departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs. Homeland security policy is coordinated at the White House by the Homeland Security Council. Other agencies with significant homeland security responsibilities include the departments of Health and Human Services, Justice, and Energy.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Creation ===\n\nIn response to the September 11 attacks, President George W. Bush announced the establishment of the Office of Homeland Security (OHS) to coordinate \"homeland security\" efforts. The office was headed by former Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge, who assumed the title of Assistant to the President for Homeland Security. The official announcement states:\n\nThe mission of the Office will be to develop and coordinate the implementation of a comprehensive national strategy to secure the United States from terrorist threats or attacks. The Office will coordinate the executive branch's efforts to detect, prepare for, prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks within the United States.\nRidge began his duties as OHS director on October 8, 2001. On November 25, 2002, the Homeland Security Act established the Department of Homeland Security to consolidate U.S. executive branch organizations related to \"homeland security\" into a single Cabinet agency. The Gilmore Commission, supported by much of Congress and John Bolton, helped to solidify further the need for the department. The DHS incorporated the following 22 agencies.\n\n\n=== List of incorporated agencies ===\n\nAccording to political scientist Peter Andreas, the creation of DHS constituted the most significant government reorganization since the Cold War and the most substantial reorganization of federal agencies since the National Security Act of 1947 (which had placed the different military departments under a secretary of defense and created the National Security Council and Central Intelligence Agency). Creation of DHS constitutes the most diverse merger ever of federal functions and responsibilities, incorporating 22 government agencies into a single organization. The founding of the DHS marked a change in American thought towards threats.\nIntroducing the term \"homeland\" centers attention on a population that needs to be protected not only against emergencies such as natural disasters but also against diffuse threats from individuals who are non-native to the United States.\nPrior to the signing of the bill, controversy about its adoption was focused on whether the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency should be incorporated in part or in whole (neither was included). The bill was also controversial for the presence of unrelated \"riders\", as well as for eliminating certain union-friendly civil service and labor protections for department employees. Without these protections, employees could be expeditiously reassigned or dismissed on grounds of security, incompetence or insubordination, and DHS would not be required to notify their union representatives. The plan stripped 180,000 government employees of their union rights. In 2002, Bush officials argued that the September 11 attacks made the proposed elimination of employee protections imperative.\n\nCongress ultimately passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, and President Bush signed the bill into law on November 25, 2002. It was the largest U.S. government reorganization in the 50 years\nThe Tom Ridge Stakes is an American Thoroughbred horse race run at Presque Isle Downs in Erie, Pennsylvania. First run in 2007, it was originally known as the Tom Ridge Labor Day Stakes when it was run the first two years on Labor Day. The race is a six-furlong event for three-year-old horses and is raced on Tapeta synthetic dirt.\nIt currently offers a purse of $100,000.\nThe race is named for Tom Ridge, who was the Governor of the State of Pennsylvania from 1995 to 2001.\n\n\n== Records ==\nSpeed  record:\n\n1:08.16 - Noholdingback Bear (2016) (at current distance of 6 furlongs)\n\n\n== Winners ==\nMark Stephen Schweiker (English pronunciation:  [mˈɑː͡ɹk stˈiːvən ʃwˈe͡ɪkɚ]; born January 31, 1953) is an American businessman and politician who served as the 44th governor of Pennsylvania from October 5, 2001, to January 21, 2003. Schweiker, a Republican, assumed the governorship in 2001, when his predecessor, Tom Ridge, resigned to become Homeland Security Advisor to President George W. Bush. Schweiker serves as the SVP and Chief Relationship Officer of Renmatix. \n\n\n== Early life ==\nMark Schweiker, second son of John and Mary Schweiker, was born in Levittown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. He is of German and Irish descent.  He attended Bishop Egan High School in Bucks County and earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania. He holds a master's degree in administration from Rider University. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Law degree from Rider University in 2004.  After college he entered the business world and held positions at Sadlier Oxford and McGraw Hill. Later, he formed his own management consulting firm.\n\n\n== Political career ==\n\n\n=== Bucks County politics ===\nSchweiker entered politics in 1979 when he successfully ran for supervisor of Middletown Township. In 1987, he was elected Bucks County Commissioner. Schweiker and fellow Republican Andrew Warren overturned a Democratic majority on the board, largely on the strength of opposition to a water project planned for Point Pleasant.\n\n\n=== Lieutenant governor ===\nIn 1994, Schweiker successfully ran for the Republican nomination for Lieutenant Governor. Schweiker ran in the fall general election alongside Congressman Tom Ridge, the gubernatorial nominee. The Ridge/Schweiker ticket won the election, beating the Democratic ticket of incumbent Lieutenant Governor Mark Singel (the gubernatorial nominee), and State Labor and Industry Secretary Tom Foley (the nominee for Lieutenant Governor) by a margin of 45.40% to 39.89%. Constitution Party candidate Peg Luksik captured 12.8 percent of the vote. The Ridge–Schweiker ticket easily won re-election in 1998.\nAs lieutenant governor, Schweiker chaired the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Council, The Board of Pardons, The Governor's Council on Recycling Development and Waste Reduction, oversaw the State-wide Radio Network, and was involved with Pennsylvania's anti-terrorism task force and the \"Weed and Seed\" anti-crime initiative.\nIn a 2002 PoliticsPA feature story designating politicians with yearbook superlatives, he was named \"Missing in Action\".\n\n\n=== Governor ===\n\nSchweiker had decided against a run for the governor's office in 2002 and was preparing to finish out his term when the September 11 terrorist attack occurred. Ridge resigned as governor on October 5, 2001, to join the Bush administration as Homeland Security Advisor. \n\nSchweiker began preparing for the transition as acting governor on September 20, and was formally sworn in as Pennsylvania's 44th governor on the day of Ridge's resignation. By provision of the Pennsylvania Constitution, Robert Jubelirer, the President Pro Tempore of the State Senate, became lieutenant governor. This became a matter of controversy as Jubelirer retained his leadership position and seat in the State Senate.\nIn the wake of the terrorist attacks, Schweiker moved to secure Pennsylvania's five nuclear reactors, created the Governor's Task Force on Security by executive order, and expanded the ranks of the Pennsylvania State Police. Schweiker also faced budget shortfalls due to the economic collapse following the attacks and a crisis in the School District of Philadelphia.\nSchweiker negotiated the state takeover of the school district and also was the first governor of Pennsylvania to put state funds into pre-school activities. He also passed tort reform measures, replacing Ridge, a former trial lawyer who was less inclined to push those measures.\nSchweiker oversaw the Quecreek Mine rescue in Somerset County, in July 2002, a 77-hour operation that save\nThe 1994 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election was held on November 8, 1994. The incumbent governor, Bob Casey, Sr. (Democrat), was barred from seeking a third term by the state constitution. The Republican Party nominated Congressman Tom Ridge, while the Democrats nominated Mark Singel, Casey's lieutenant governor. Ridge went on to win the race with 45% of the vote. Singel finished with 39%, and Constitution Party candidate Peg Luksik finished third, garnering 12% of the vote.\n\n\n== Democratic primary ==\n\n\n=== Candidates ===\nCatherine Baker Knoll, Pennsylvania Treasurer (from Allegheny County)\nDwight Evans, State Representative (from Philadelphia)\nBob O'Donnell, State Representative and former Speaker of the House (from Philadelphia)\nMark Singel, Lieutenant Governor (from Cambria County)\nPhillip Valenti, LaRouche activist (from Chester County)\nChuck Volpe, insurance executive (from Allegheny County)\nLynn Yeakel, philanthropist and 1992 nominee for U.S. Senate (from Montgomery County)\n\n\n=== Campaign ===\nLt. Governor Singel was a well-known figure in the state and was a clear early frontrunner after serving six months as acting governor as Bob Casey underwent cancer treatments. However, his 1992 defeat by Lynn Yeakel in the 1992 Democratic primary for senate left the party feeling that Singel was vulnerable in a statewide election. Treasurer Catherine Baker Knoll, who was popular with older voters and siphoned the support of some labor groups from Singel, was viewed as his biggest threat, but state representative Dwight Evans, who mobilized urban minority voters, finished a somewhat surprising second. Former state Speaker of the House Bob O'Donnell and Yeakel, who was criticized for campaigning poorly in the close 1992 senate race, both saw their campaigns fail to get traction.\n\n\n=== Results ===\n\n\n== Republican primary ==\n\n\n=== Candidates ===\nSam Katz, political consultant (from Philadelphia)\nMike Fisher, state senator and 1986 lieutenant governor nominee (from Allegheny County)\nJack Perry\nErnie Preate, Pennsylvania Attorney General (from Lackawanna County)\nTom Ridge, U.S. Representative from Erie (from Erie County)\n\n\n=== Campaign ===\nAttorney General Ernie Preate, who was known for both being a tough prosecutor and working to reform the mental health system, was seen as the initial frontrunner, but his attempt was marred by a corruption controversy. Mike Fisher, a state senator and former candidate for lieutenant governor, sought to take advantage of Preate's missteps but was unable gain a majority of establishment support. Tom Ridge, who Republicans had initially tried to court to run in the 1990 election, slowly built name recognition and gained political backing due to his relatively moderate track record.

In contrast, Ridge had been a relatively obscure Congressman who was mostly unknown outside of his Erie base. Ridge proved to be a successful fundraiser and undercut support from Democrats in the socially liberal but fiscally conservative suburbs of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.\nAbortion became a key issue in the campaign. Peg Luksik ran a strong third party campaign in opposition to the Republican nominations of the pro-choice Ridge and Barbara Hafer in their most recent two gubernatorial campaigns. Singel, who is\nPresque Isle State Park ( PRESK) is a 3,112-acre (1,259 ha) Pennsylvania State Park on an arching, sandy peninsula jutting into Lake Erie, 4 miles (6 km) west of the city of Erie, in Millcreek Township, Erie County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. The peninsula sweeps northeastward, surrounding Presque Isle Bay along the park's southern coast. It has 13 miles (21 km) of roads, 21 miles (34 km) of recreational trails, 13 beaches for swimming, and a marina. Popular activities at the park include swimming, boating, hiking, biking, and birdwatching.\nThe recorded history of Presque Isle begins with the Erielhonan, a Native American tribe who gave their name to Lake Erie, and includes French, British, and American forts, as well as serving as a base for Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry's fleet in the War of 1812. With the growing importance of shipping on Lake Erie in the 19th century, Presque Isle became home to several lighthouses and what later became a United States Coast Guard station. In 1921, it became a state park, and as of 2007 it hosts over 4 million visitors per year, the most of any Pennsylvania state park.\nThe Presque Isle peninsula formed on a moraine from the end of the Wisconsin glaciation and is constantly being reshaped by waves and wind. This leads to seven ecological zones within the park, which provides a classic example of ecological succession. A National Natural Landmark since 1967, the park has been named one of the best places in the United States for watching birds, particularly in the Gull Point Natural Area. The Tom Ridge Environmental Center at the entrance to the park allows visitors to learn more about the park and its ecology. Presque Isle State Park has been chosen by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Parks for its list of \"25 Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks\".\nThe park was one of five Pennsylvania State Parks in the path of totality for the 2024 solar eclipse, with 3 minutes and 45 seconds of totality.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early inhabitants ===\nPresque Isle was formed at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation about 11,000 years ago. The earliest known inhabitants of the southern Lake Erie coast were the Erielhonan, also known as the \"Eriez\", an Iroquoian speaking tribe of Native Americans. Erielhonan meant the \"Cat\" or \"Raccoon\" people, and the name \"Erie\", a corruption of Erielhonan, became the name of the lake and county in which Presque Isle Park is found and of the city nearest the park.\nAn Erielhonan legend taught that the Great Spirit led them to Presque Isle because of the wealth of game, the abundance of clean fresh water, and the cool breezes \"coming from the land of snow and ice\" (i.e. Canada). Another legend explains how the Erielhonan ventured into Lake Erie in search of the land where the sun set, but the spirit of the lake blew a fierce storm to keep them from finding it. To protect the Erielhonan from the storm, their god laid his outstretched arm into the lake, giving them safety during the storm. The god's arm remained in the lake, protecting the tribe's future generations.\nThe Erielhonan are believed to have lived and farmed on the peninsula. They fought several wars, the last starting in 1653 with the Five Nations of the Iroquois. Despite initial victories over the Senecas, in 1654 the Erielhonans' largest village, Rique (at the modern city of Erie), was destroyed by 1,800 Iroquois warriors. By 1656, the Erielhonan had been destroyed as a people, although the Iroquois adopted survivors who were absorbed primarily into the Senecas.\n\n\n=== Forts, settlers, and War of 1812 ===\nThe French first named the peninsula in the 1720s; presque-isle means peninsula (lit. \"almost an island\") in French. They built Fort Presque Isle at the modern city of Erie in the summer of 1753, naming it for the peninsula that protected the fort. The French also built two \"military outposts\" on Presque Isle itself. The first outpost was located at the entrance to the peninsula and the second was built at the easter\nRobert Patrick Casey Sr. (January 9, 1932 – May 30, 2000) was an American lawyer and politician from Pennsylvania who served as the 42nd governor of Pennsylvania from 1987 to 1995. He served as a member of the Pennsylvania Senate for the 22nd district from 1963 to 1968 and as Auditor General of Pennsylvania from 1969 to 1977.\nCasey was best known for leading the anti-abortion wing of the Democratic Party, spearheading the opposition against Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a landmark Supreme Court decision on abortion. He championed unions, believed in government as a beneficent force, and supported gun rights.\nHis son, Bob Casey Jr., also served as Auditor General of Pennsylvania and went on to serve as Pennsylvania Treasurer and as U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania, a position he has held since 2007.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nCasey was born in Jackson Heights, Queens, the son of Alphonsus Liguori and Marie (née Cummings) Casey. His family, of Irish descent, was originally from Scranton, Pennsylvania, but his parents moved to New York in order for his father, a devoutly Roman Catholic former coal miner who began working as a coal miner at age 10, to attend Fordham University School of Law. The family returned to Scranton following Casey's birth.\nAfter attending Scranton Preparatory School, Casey turned down an offer to play for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1949, opting to go to college instead. He went to the College of the Holy Cross, where he was president of his senior class, on a basketball scholarship. He played on the same team as future NBA hall of famer Bob Cousy.  He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1953, and received his Juris Doctor from George Washington University in 1956. Upon graduation and admission to the bar, Casey worked for the Washington, D.C., law firm Covington & Burling, where he remained until returning to Scranton in 1958 to enter solo practice.\n\n\n== Political career ==\n\n\n=== State Senate ===\nCasey served as a Democratic Party member of the Pennsylvania State Senate for the 22nd district from 1963 to 1968. He first sought the office of Governor of Pennsylvania in 1966, losing the Democratic Party primary to Milton Shapp. Casey was the candidate of the party establishment, but the independently wealthy Shapp ran a successful insurgent campaign for the nomination. Casey tried on two other occasions without success, in 1970 (again losing to Shapp) and again in 1978 (losing to Pete Flaherty). Considered a moderate and despite growing frustration with Democratic Party policies, Casey rejected Republican offers to run for governor on their ticket on two occasions.\n\n\n=== Auditor General ===\nIn 1968 and 1972 Casey was elected to the post of Auditor General of Pennsylvania. Paul Beers in his 1980 book \"Pennsylvania Politics Today and Yesterday: The Tolerable Accommodation\", wrote that Casey was \"regarded as the finest auditor general the Commonwealth ever had.\" During his term as Auditor General, Casey was noted for feuding with then-Governor Shapp over Pennsylvania's pension system and exposing corruption. Before Casey, the Auditor General's office had no public accountants, who hired 24 of them. Beers notes that during his two terms, \"Contracts for day care, Medicare, the Farm Show, highways, [Milton] Shapp's pet dream of a Pocono Arts Center, and property leases were all investigated and audited thoroughly by Casey, with accompanying headlines when he uncovered mistakes or petty corruptions.\"\n\n\n=== Third gubernatorial run and mistaken identity ===\nRestricted from seeking another term as Auditor General of Pennsylvania, Casey declined to seek the office of Pennsylvania Treasurer in 1976. Instead, a Cambria County recorder of deeds named Robert E. Casey won the Democratic primary and the general election, spending virtually no money and doing virtually no campaigning; voters merely assumed they were voting for the outgoing Auditor General.\nIn 1978, another candidate named Robert P. Casey, this one\nEugene W. Hickok (born 1951, Denver, Colorado) is a former United States Deputy Secretary of Education, serving from 2003 to 2005 under President George W.

He is an adjunct professor at the University of Richmond.\n\n\n== Education ==\nHickok is a 1972 graduate of Hampden–Sydney College. He also received a Master of Public Administration and Ph.D. from the University of Virginia.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nFor over 15 years, Hickok worked at Dickinson College where he held various roles as professor of political science, director of the college’s Clarke Center for the Interdisciplinary Study of Contemporary Issues, and an adjunct professor at the Dickinson School of Law.\nHe also worked as an associate director of the political science department at Mississippi State University, and the director of financial aid for Hampden–Sydney College.\nFrom 1986-1987, he served as a special assistant in the Office of Legal Counsel at the United States Department of Justice.\nFrom 1990 to 1991, he served as a resident adjunct scholar at The Heritage Foundation.\n\n\n=== Public service ===\nFrom 1992-1995, Hickok was elected to and served as a member of the Carlisle Area School District Board of Directors.\nIn 1995, he was appointed by Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge as Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Education.\nPresident George W. Bush nominated Hickok as Under Secretary of Education on March 30, 2001 and he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on July 10, 2001. He later served as Acting Deputy Secretary of Education and was officially nominated and recess appointed as United States Deputy Secretary of Education by Bush in 2004, resigning later that year. In his position as Deputy Secretary of Education, Hickok managed the development and execution of the President's educational priorities, including the No Child Left Behind Act. In 2007, he agreed to pay a $50,000 civil settlement relating to a conflict-of-interest matter concerning stock he owned while Deputy Secretary of Education.\n\n\n=== Post-Public Service career ===\nIn July 2005, Hickok was hired by Washington, DC–based government affairs firm Dutko Worldwide to head their education practice.\nHickok currently teaches as an adjunct professor of Constitutional Politics at the University of Richmond.\nHe currently serves on the Board of Trustees of Hampden-Sydney College and has previously served on Board of Directors at Montpelier, a historic house museum located at the plantation owned by President James Madison.\n\n\n== External links ==\nU.S. Department of Education Biography\nhttp://www.carlisleschools.org\nAppearances on C-SPAN\nThe Tom Ridge Environmental Center is an educational facility that is located on the grounds of Presque Isle State Park in Erie, Pennsylvania in the United States.\nDesigned by Wallace, Roberts & Todd Architects, this environmental education center was awarded the 2007 President's Award for design-build projects in Delaware and Pennsylvania by the American Society of Landscape Architects.\n\n\n== History and notable features ==\nNamed after former Governor of Pennsylvania and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge, the center opened on May 26, 2006.\nIt features 65,000 square feet (6,039 m2) of space including interpretive exhibits highlighting local and regional flora and fauna, as well as information on the human history and culture of the area. The center also has a large-format movie theater, a gift shop, a cafe, a visitors' center, and an observation tower of 75 feet (23 m)  that overlooks Lake Erie and Waldameer Park and Water World. The facility also has five conference rooms and eight laboratories for environmental education and research of supporting organizations, plus the administrative offices of several environmental and conservation groups and agencies.\nThe center was designed by Wallace, Roberts & Todd Architects, and received the 2007 American Society of Landscape Architects President's Award for design-build projects in Delaware and Pennsylvania.\nThe parking lot in front of the facility was previously occupied by a drive-in theater, the Peninsula, which opened in 1969 and closed in 2001 (five years before the environmental center opened).\nLocated next to the parking lot was a small wind turbine constructed in 2007.  It was removed after several incidents in which ice chunks were flung from the blades and damaged the roof of the building.

Erie is about 80 miles (130 km) from Buffalo, 90 miles (140 km) from Cleveland, and 120 miles (190 km) from Pittsburgh. \nThe city was named for the Native American Erie people who lived in the area until the mid-17th century. Its nicknames include \"Gem City\", a reference to its fine natural harbor, the \"Gem of the Great Lakes\"; and more recently, \"Flagship City\", from a local marketing effort to play up the homeport of Oliver Hazard Perry's flagship Niagara.\nManufacturing continues to play a large part in Erie's economy, with rising contributions from insurance, healthcare, higher education, technology, service industries, and tourism. Like the other Great Lakes port cities, Erie is accessible to the oceans via the Lake Ontario and St. Lawrence River network in Canada. The local climate is humid, four-seasonal, and snowy, with warm summers and harsh winters, owing to its southern lakeshore location.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIndigenous peoples occupied the shoreline and bluffs in this area for thousands of years, taking advantage of the rich resources. Sommerheim Park Archaeological District in Millcreek Township west of the city, includes artifacts from the Archaic period in the Americas and the early and middle Woodland Period, roughly a span from 8,000 BCE to 500 CE.\nEuropeans first arrived as settlers in the region when the French constructed Fort Presque Isle near present-day Erie in 1753, as part of their effort to defend New France against the encroaching British colonists. The name of the fort refers to the peninsula that juts into Lake Erie, now protected as Presque Isle State Park. The French term presque-isle means peninsula. When the French abandoned the fort in 1760 during the French and Indian War in the Seven Years' War, it was the last post they held west of Niagara River. The British established a garrison at the fort at Presque Isle that same year, three years before the end of the French and Indian War.\nErie is in what was the disputed Erie Triangle, a tract of land comprising 202,187 acres in the northwest corner of Pennsylvania fronting Lake Erie that was claimed after the American Revolutionary War by the newly formed states of New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, as part of its Western Reserve, and Massachusetts.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\n\nThe Iroquois claimed ownership of present-day Erie. On January 9, 1789, a conference was arranged during which representatives from the Iroquois signed a deed relinquishing their ownership of the land in exchange for $2,000 from Pennsylvania and $1,200 from the federal government. Seneca Nation separately settled land claims against Pennsylvania in February 1791 for the sum of $800. It became a part of Pennsylvania on March 3, 1792, after Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York relinquished their rights to the land and sold the land to Pennsylvania for 75 cents per acre or a total of $151,640.25 in continental certificates.\nThe General Assembly of Pennsylvania commissioned the surveying of land near Presque Isle through an act passed on April 18, 1795. Andrew Ellicott, who completed Pierre Charles L'Enfant's survey of Washington, D.C., and helped resolve the boundary between Pennsylvania and New York, arrived to begin the survey and lay out the plan for the city in June 1795. The initial settlement of the area began that year. Lt. Colonel Seth Reed and his family moved to the Erie area from Geneva, New York; they were Yankees from Uxbridge, Massachusetts. They became the first European-American settlers of Erie in present-day Presque Isle.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nPresident James Madison began the construction of a naval fleet during the W\nThe 1998 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election was held on November 3, 1998. The candidates were incumbent Republican Tom Ridge, Democrat Ivan Itkin, Constitutionalist Peg Luksik and Libertarian Ken Krawchuk. Ridge, a popular moderate, won with 57 percent of the votes cast.\nAs of 2024, this was the last gubernatorial election in which Delaware, Lackawanna and Montgomery counties voted for the Republican candidate, and was the last time a Republican was re-elected as Governor of Pennsylvania. It was also the first time since 1930 that Greene County, Fayette County, and Washington County voted Republican.\n\n\n== Primary elections ==\nIncumbent Governor Ridge ran unopposed for the Republican nomination, and was endorsed by multiple newspapers across the state, including the York Daily Record. State Representative Ivan Itkin from Pittsburgh defeated former Auditor General and US Representative Don Bailey from Greensburg and private detective and anti-corruption activist Bill Keisling from York. Itkin, although not well known in the state, was a powerful figure in the legislature and had the backing of the party establishment, while the conservative Bailey drew strong union support.\n\n\n== General election ==\n\n\n=== Candidates ===\nIvan Itkin, State Representative (Democratic)\nRunning mate: Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, former U.S. Representative\nKen Krawchuk, technology consultant (Libertarian)\nRunning mate: Henry Haller, attorney\nPeg Luksik, director of an anti-abortion organization and candidate in 1994 (Constitution)\nRunning mate: Jim Clymer, attorney and nominee for Lt. Governor in 1994\nTom Ridge, incumbent Governor (Republican)\nRunning mate: Mark Schweiker, incumbent Lieutenant Governor\n\n\n=== Campaign ===\nDuring this election cycle, Democrats struggled with fundraising issues and had difficulty recruiting a top tier candidate. Itkin, who had little name recognition statewide, was considered to be a sacrificial lamb. Peg Luksik, who was well known as an outspoken opponent of abortion, ran as a strong third party contender for the second consecutive election cycle; she emphasized the pro-choice stances of both candidates and drew votes in the state's rural, conservative center. However, Ridge's victory was never in doubt, as he ran on a generally positive record from his prior term and a combination of traditional Republican strategies (such as his \"tough on crime\" image) combined with his ability to somewhat undercut Democratic support (such as through his labor ties).\n\n\n=== Results ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\nSources\n\nCromwell, Gary E, ed.

A member of the Republican Party, he was also attorney general of Pennsylvania.\nBorn in Philadelphia, Corbett is a graduate of Lebanon Valley College and St. Mary's University School of Law and served as a captain in the Pennsylvania Army National Guard. Corbett began his career as an assistant district attorney in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, in 1976. Corbett then joined the U.S. Department of Justice as an assistant U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, serving from 1980 to 1983, upon entering private practice. In 1988 Corbett was first elected to public office as a Township Commissioner in the Pittsburgh suburb of Shaler, before serving as the United States Attorney for Western Pennsylvania from 1989 to 1993 in the George H. W. Bush administration.\nIn 1995, Corbett was appointed to fill the remainder of Ernie Preate's term as Attorney General of Pennsylvania, until 1997. Corbett then reentered private practice and worked as the general counsel for Waste Management, Inc before being elected Attorney General of Pennsylvania in 2004. Corbett was then elected to a second term in 2008, serving a total of two non-consecutive tenures as attorney general from 1995 to 1997, and 2005 to 2011.\nCorbett was elected Governor of Pennsylvania when he defeated Democratic nominee Dan Onorato in the 2010 general election. He was the second Pennsylvania attorney general to win the state's highest office. Corbett lost his bid for a second term to Democrat Tom Wolf in the 2014 general election. This election marked the first time an incumbent governor running for re-election in Pennsylvania lost since William Bigler in 1854, and the first time in history that a Republican governor lost re-election in Pennsylvania. After his defeat he returned to private life and registered as a lobbyist in 2021. As of 2024, he is the last Republican governor of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n== Early life, education, and early career ==\nCorbett was born in Philadelphia, the son of Mary Bernardine (Diskin) and Thomas W. Corbett. He received his Bachelor's degree at Lebanon Valley College and was employed as a 9th grade teacher for one year at Pine Grove Area School District Corbett then earned his J.D. from St. Mary's University Law School. He served in the Pennsylvania Army National Guard's 28th Infantry Division from 1971 to 1984, rising to the rank of captain.\nCorbett's career has been split between private practice and civil service. He began his legal career as an assistant district attorney in Pittsburgh's Allegheny County in 1976. After three and a half years, he was hired in 1980 as an assistant United States Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania.\nIn 1983, Corbett entered private practice as an associate partner at Rose, Schmidt, Hasley & DiSalle. From 1988 and 1989, Corbett won his first election as a township commissioner in the Pittsburgh suburb of Shaler Township.\nIn 1988, a judge appointed him to monitor the Allegheny County jail while it was under the court's supervision. In 1989, Senators John Heinz and Arlen Specter recommended to President Bush that he nominate Corbett as U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania. Corbett served in the post until May 1993, when he was dismissed by President Bill Clinton.\nCorbett then returned to private practice, also serving as an adviser to the gubernatorial campaign of Tom Ridge. Following Ridge's victory, Corbett served on a number of state commissions including the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency, which he served as chairman.\nCorbett left office in 1997 and again went into the private sector, first as general counsel for Waste Management, Inc., then opening his own practice.\n\n\n== Attorney General ==\n\n\n=== 1995 appointment and tenure ===\nIn 1995, Corbett was appointed to the position of Stat\nThe 2001 anthrax attacks, also known as Amerithrax (a portmanteau of \"America\" and \"anthrax\", from its FBI case name), occurred in the United States over the course of several weeks beginning on September 18, 2001, one week after the September 11 terrorist attacks. Letters containing anthrax spores were mailed to several news media offices and to Senators Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy, killing five people and infecting 17 others. Capitol Police Officers and staffers working for Senator Russ Feingold were exposed as well. According to the FBI, the ensuing investigation became \"one of the largest and most complex in the history of law enforcement\".\nA major focus in the early years of the investigation was bioweapons expert Steven Hatfill, who was eventually exonerated. Bruce Edwards Ivins, a scientist at the government's biodefense labs at Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland, became a focus around April 4, 2005. On April 11, 2007, Ivins was put under periodic surveillance and an FBI document stated that he was \"an extremely sensitive suspect in the 2001 anthrax attacks\". On July 29, 2008, Ivins committed suicide with an overdose of acetaminophen (paracetamol / Tylenol).\nFederal prosecutors declared Ivins the sole perpetrator on August 6, 2008, based on DNA evidence leading to an anthrax vial in his lab. Two days later, Senator Chuck Grassley and Representative Rush D. Holt Jr. called for hearings into the Department of Justice and FBI's handling of the investigation. The FBI formally closed its investigation on February 19, 2010.\nIn 2008, the FBI requested a review of the scientific methods used in their investigation from the National Academy of Sciences, which released their findings in the 2011 report Review of the Scientific Approaches Used During the FBI's Investigation of the 2001 Anthrax Letters. The report cast doubt on the government's conclusion that Ivins was the perpetrator, finding that the type of anthrax used in the letters was correctly identified as the Ames strain of the bacterium, but that there was insufficient scientific evidence for the FBI's assertion that it originated from Ivins' laboratory. The FBI responded by saying that the review panel asserted that it would not be possible to reach a definite conclusion based on science alone, and said that a combination of factors led the FBI to conclude that Ivins had been the perpetrator. Some information is still sealed concerning the case and Ivins' mental health.: 8 footnote  The government settled lawsuits that were filed by the widow of the first anthrax victim Bob Stevens for $2.5 million with no admission of liability. The settlement was reached solely for the purpose of \"avoiding the expenses and risks of further litigations\", according to a statement in the agreement.\n\n\n== Context ==\nThe anthrax attacks began just a week after the September 11 attacks, which had caused the destruction of the original World Trade Center in New York City, damage to the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and the crash of an airliner in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The attacks came in two waves. The first set of letters containing anthrax had a Trenton, New Jersey, postmark dated September 18, 2001. Five letters are believed to have been mailed at this time to ABC News, CBS News, NBC News and the New York Post, all located in New York City, and to the National Enquirer at American Media, Inc., (AMI) in Boca Raton, Florida.\nThe first known victim of the attacks, Robert Stevens, who worked at the Sun tabloid, also published by AMI, died on October 5, 2001, four days after entering a Florida hospital with an undiagnosed illness that caused him to vomit and be short of breath. The presumed letter containing the anthrax which killed Stevens was never found. Only the New York Post and NBC News letters were actually identified; the existence of the other three letters is inferred because individuals at ABC, CBS and AMI became infected with anthrax. Scientists examining the anthrax fro\nThe Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, commonly referred to as the Homeland Security Advisor and formerly the Deputy National Security Advisor for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, is a senior aide in the National Security Council, based in the West Wing of the White House, who serves as principal advisor to the President of the United States on homeland security and counterterrorism issues.\nThe Homeland Security Advisor is also a statutory member of the United States Homeland Security Council. Serving at the pleasure of the President, the Homeland Security Advisor does not require Senate confirmation for appointment to the office.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks, President George W. Bush announced the creation of the interim Office of Homeland Security as a cabinet-level office in a speech to a joint session of Congress. He appointed Tom Ridge as its first director. The Homeland Security Council was formally created on October 5, 2001, replacing the Office of Homeland Security.\nUnder the George W. Bush administration, the Homeland Security Advisor was independent of the National Security Council, residing within the Homeland Security Council. Under the Obama administration, while the Homeland Security Council remained, the Advisor held the title of Deputy National Security Advisor for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, subordinating the position to the National Security Advisor.\nAt the start of the Trump administration, the position of Homeland Security Advisor, occupied by Tom Bossert, was elevated to the rank of Assistant to the President, making it equal in rank to the National Security Advisor. However, after clashes with the National Security Advisor, John Bolton, the position returned to the rank of Deputy Assistant to the President and was subordinate to the National Security Advisor.\n\n\n== List of Homeland Security Advisors ==\n  Democratic\n  Republican\n  Independent\n\n\n=== Titles ===\nAssistant to the President for Homeland Security (September 20, 2001 – July 28, 2004)\nAssistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism (July 28, 2004 – January 20, 2009)\nDeputy National Security Advisor for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism (January 20, 2009 – January 20, 2017)\nAssistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism (January 20, 2017 – May 31, 2018)\nDeputy Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism (June 1, 2018 – January 20, 2021)\nAssistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor and Deputy National Security Advisor (January 20, 2021 – present)\n\n\n== See also ==\nExecutive Office of the President\n\n\n== References ==\nThomas Andrew Daschle ( DASH-əl; born December 9, 1947) is an American politician and lobbyist who represented South Dakota in the United States Senate from 1987 to 2005. A member of the Democratic Party, he led the Senate Democratic Caucus during the final ten years of his tenure, during which time he served as Senate Minority Leader and Majority Leader.\nAfter leaving the United States Air Force, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1978 and served four terms. In 1986, he was elected to the U.S. Senate, becoming Minority Leader in 1995 and Majority Leader in 2001, becoming the highest-ranking elected official in South Dakota history.\nIn 2004, he was defeated for reelection in a close race. Later, he took a position as a policy advisor with a lobbying firm, became a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, and co-authored a book advocating universal health care.\nDaschle was an early supporter of Barack Obama's presidential candidacy, and was nominated by President-elect Obama for the position of Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services after the 2008 election. However, Daschle withdrew his name on February 3, 2009, amid a growing controversy over his failure to properly report and pay income taxes. He is currently working for The Daschle Group, a Public Policy Advisory of Baker Donelson, a large law firm and lobbying group.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nDaschle was born in Aberdeen, South Dakota, the son of Elizabeth B. (née Meier) and Sebastian C. Daschle, both of German descent. His paternal grandparents were Volga Germans. He grew up in a working-class Roman Catholic family,  the eldest of four brothers.\nHe attended Central High School in Aberdeen before becoming the first person in his family to graduate from college when he earned a B.A. from the Department of Political Science at South Dakota State University in 1969. While attending South Dakota State University, Daschle became a brother of Alpha Phi Omega. From 1969 to 1972, Daschle served in the United States Air Force as an intelligence officer with the Strategic Air Command.\nIn the mid-1970s Daschle was an aide to Senator James Abourezk.\n\n\n== House of Representatives (1979–1987) ==\nIn 1978 Daschle was elected to the United States House of Representatives at the age of 31, winning the race by a margin of 139 votes, following a recount, out of more than 129,000 votes cast. Daschle served four terms in the House of Representatives and quickly became a part of the Democratic leadership.\nAlthough Daschle was not seeking the vice presidency, he received 10 (0.30%) delegate votes for Vice President of the United States at the 1980 Democratic National Convention.  Several others also received protest votes, but incumbent Vice President Walter Mondale was nevertheless renominated easily.\n\n\n== United States Senate (1987–2005) ==\n\nIn 1986, Daschle was elected to the U.S. Senate in a close victory over incumbent Republican James Abdnor. In his first year, he was appointed to the Finance Committee.\n\n\n=== Party leadership ===\nIn 1994, he was chosen by his colleagues to succeed the retiring Senator George Mitchell as Democratic minority leader. In the history of the Senate, only Lyndon B. Johnson had served fewer years before being elected to lead his party. In addition to the minority leader's post, Daschle served as a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry. South Dakotans reelected Daschle to the Senate by overwhelming margins in 1998.\nAt various points in his career, he served on the Veterans Affairs, Indian Affairs, Finance, and Ethics Committees.\nWhen the 107th Congress commenced on January 3, 2001, the Senate was evenly divided—that is, there were 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans. Outgoing Vice President Al Gore acted in his constitutional capacity as ex officio President of the Senate, and used his tie-breaking vote to give the Democrats the majority in that chamber.

The governor may grant pardons except in cases of impeachment, but only when recommended by the Board of Pardons.\nThere have been seven presidents and 48 governors of Pennsylvania, with two governors (Robert E. Pattison and Gifford Pinchot) serving non-consecutive terms, totaling 55 terms in both offices. The longest term was that of the first governor, Thomas Mifflin, who served three full terms as governor in addition to two years as President of the Continental Congress. The shortest term belonged to John C. Bell Jr., who served only 19 days as acting governor after his predecessor, Edward Martin, resigned. \nThe current governor is Josh Shapiro, who took office on January 17, 2023.\n\n\n== Governors ==\n\nPennsylvania was one of the original Thirteen Colonies and was admitted as a state on December 12, 1787. Before it declared its independence, Pennsylvania was a colony of the Kingdom of Great Britain.\n\n\n=== Presidents of the Supreme Executive Council ===\nThe Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 created the Supreme Executive Council as the state's executive branch, with a president as its head. The president was chosen annually by the council, though with no specific term dates.\nThe constitution created the position of \"vice-president\", though no provision was made if the office of the president became vacant, which occurred four times later. Contemporary sources continue to label the chief executive in such times as the vice-president, without any notion of succeeding in the presidency. One acting president, George Bryan, was subsequently recognized later as a full-fledged governor, due to his acting as president for over six months.\n\n\n=== Governors of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ===\n\nThe 1790 constitution abolished the council and replaced the president with a governor, and established a three-year term for governor commencing on the third Tuesday of the December following the election, with governors not allowed to serve more than nine out of any twelve years. The 1838 constitution moved the start of the term to the third Tuesday of the January following the election, and allowed governors to only serve six out of any nine years. The 1874 constitution lengthened the term to four years, and prohibited governors from succeeding themselves. The current constitution of 1968 changed this to allow governors to serve two consecutive terms, with no lifetime limit.\nUnder the 1968 constitution, Milton Shapp was the first governor to serve two terms, and Tom Corbett was the first incumbent governor to lose a re-election bid.\nIf the office of governor becomes vacant through death, resignation, or conviction on impeachment, the lieutenant governor becomes governor for the remainder of the term; if the office is only temporarily vacant due to disability of the governor, the lieutenant governor only acts out the duties of governor. Should both offices be vacant, the president pro tempore of the state senate becomes governor. The position of a lieutenant  governor was created in the 1874 constitution; prior to then, the speaker of the senate would act as governor in cases of vacancy. Originally, the lieutenant governor could only act as governor; it was not until the 1968 constitution that the lieutenant governor could actually become the sitting governor in that fashion. The office of governor has been vacant for an extended period once before, a 17-day gap in 1848 between the resignation of the previous governor and the swearing in of his acting successor. Governors and lieutenant governors are elected on the same political party ticket.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGubernatorial lines of succession in the United States#Pennsylvania\nLi\nThe 2002 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election was held on November 5, 2002, to elect the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania. Incumbent Republican governor Mark Schweiker, who took office in 2001 when Tom Ridge resigned to become Homeland Security Advisor, was eligible to run for a full term, but did not do so. Democrat Ed Rendell, the former mayor of Philadelphia and Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, emerged from a competitive primary to win the general election against Republican Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike Fisher.\nRendell won the election, with commentators attributing his victory to \"endless retail politicking\" and a hard-working campaign. The political website PoliticsPA praised Rendell's campaign team of David L. Cohen, David W. Sweet, and Sandi Vito. Fisher's strategy backfired; Rendell performed well in much of Eastern Pennsylvania and he was able to win by huge margins in even many traditionally Republican suburbs.\nRendell was the first official from Philadelphia to win the governorship since 1914. This was the first time since 1826 that a Democrat won all four of Philadelphia's suburban counties and the first time since 1970 that a Democrat won Montgomery County in a gubernatorial election.\n\n\n== Republican primary ==\nAttorney General Mike Fisher ran unopposed for the Republican nomination. Although incumbent Governor Mark Schweiker was eligible to run for election to a full term (he had served only a partial term after Tom Ridge resigned to become Homeland Security Advisor), he chose not to seek his party's nomination. Despite polls showing that Schweiker polled well among the same groups that backed Ridge, the Republican establishment considered Schweiker to be a weak candidate and stood steadfast behind Fisher.\n\n\n== Democratic primary ==\n\n\n=== Candidates ===\nEd Rendell, former Mayor of Philadelphia and candidate in 1986\nBob Casey Jr., incumbent Auditor General and son of former Governor Bob Casey Sr.\n\n\n=== Campaign ===\nIn the Democratic primary, former mayor of Philadelphia Ed Rendell defeated Pennsylvania Auditor General Bob Casey Jr., bucking the \"myth that a Philadelphian could never win\" a statewide election.

Chertoff previously served as a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, as a federal prosecutor, and as Assistant U.S. Attorney General. He succeeded Tom Ridge as U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security on February 15, 2005.\nSince leaving government service, he co-founded the Chertoff Group, a risk-management and security consulting company. He has also worked as senior of counsel at the Washington, D.C., law firm of Covington & Burling. He is also the chair and a member of the board of trustees in the international freedom watchdog Freedom House, and sits on the bipartisan advisory board of States United Democracy Center.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMichael Chertoff was born to Gershon Baruch Chertoff (1915–96), a rabbi and Talmudic scholar who was the leader of Congregation B'nai Israel in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and Livia Chertoff (née Eisen), a Polish–born Israeli American who was the first flight attendant for El Al. His paternal grandparents are Paul Chertoff, a rabbi and professor of Talmud, and Esther Barish Chertoff.\nChertoff attended the Jewish Educational Center in Elizabeth as well as the Pingry School. He graduated from Harvard College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1975. During his sophomore year, he studied abroad at the London School of Economics and Political Science. He then attended Harvard Law School, where he worked as a research assistant for John Hart Ely on his book Democracy and Distrust. Chertoff received a Juris Doctor, magna cum laude, in 1978.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFollowing his law school graduation, Chertoff served as a law clerk to Judge Murray Gurfein of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and later for United States Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. from 1979 to 1980.\nChertoff worked in private practice with Latham & Watkins from 1980 to 1983 before being hired as a prosecutor by Rudolph Giuliani, then the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Chertoff worked on Mafia and political corruption–related cases. In the mid-1990s, Chertoff returned to Latham & Watkins for a brief period, founding the firm's office in Newark, New Jersey.\nIn September 1986, together with United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York Rudolph Giuliani, Chertoff was instrumental in the crackdown on organized crime in the Mafia Commission Trial.\nIn 1990, Chertoff was appointed by President George H. W. Bush as United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey. Among his most important cases, in 1992 Chertoff achieved conviction of second-term Jersey City mayor Gerald McCann on charges of defrauding money from a savings and loan scam. McCann served two years in federal prison.\nIn 1993, he was a prosecutor in the fraud case against Eddie Antar, founder of the Crazy Eddie electronics store chain.\n\nChertoff was asked to stay in his position when the Clinton administration took office in 1993, at the request of Democratic Senator Bill Bradley. He was the only United States Attorney who was not replaced due to the change in administrations. He continued to work with the U.S. Attorney's office until 1994, when he entered private practice, returning to Latham & Watkins as a partner.\nDespite his friendly relationship with some Democrats, Chertoff was appointed as the special counsel for the Senate Whitewater Committee studying allegations against President Clinton and his wife in what was known as the Whitewater investigation. No charges were brought against the Clintons.\nIn 2000, Chertoff worked as special counsel to the New Jersey Senate Judiciary Committee, investigating racial profiling in New Jersey.

For the following decades, each county throughout the state was in charge of carrying out private hangings within their jails. 1915 saw the first use of the electric chair, two years after it was approved by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1913. The delay was due to the time needed to finish the Western Penitentiary in Centre County, now the State Correctional Institution – Rockview. From 1915 to 1962, 350 people were executed by electric chair. Most of these defendants were men, but two of them were women.\nA total of 1,043 people have been executed in Pennsylvania since 1693. As of 2002 this was the third-highest of any other state or commonwealth in the United States, after New York (1,130) and Virginia (1,361). Since 1978, there have been nearly 25,000 homicides throughout the state of Pennsylvania, where 408 of these homicides ended in defendants being put on death row which amounts to 1.6 death sentences for every 100 homicides.\nThe former governor of Pennsylvania, Robert Casey, signed a bill in 1990 that changed the method of execution from electrocution to lethal injection.\n\n\n=== 2015 moratorium ===\nIn 2015, the state of Pennsylvania spent about $46 million annually on the death penalty to maintain the prisoners housed on death row, as well as carry out any executions. The average price to house and take care of a death row inmate per year was about $42,000. With concerns over the cost of the death penalty growing, governor Tom Wolf requested a cost-benefit analysis. In February 2015, Wolf announced a moratorium on executions that is still in effect as of February 2023. Capital crimes are still prosecuted and death warrants are still executed. Wolf stated, \"In no way does this mean sympathy for those guilty on death row.\" In justifying the moratorium, Wolf asserted as concerns that the system claims innocent lives, is not a deterrent to crime, is racially biased, costs a lot of money, and disregards mental illness in the US.\n\n\n== Death row ==\n\nThe execution chamber of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is on the grounds of SCI Rockview. As of 2024 male death row inmates are housed at SCI Phoenix and SCI Somerset.\nPreviously death row inmates were held at SCI Greene, which housed most men in this category. As of 2015, 80% of all Pennsylvania death row inmates were held at Greene. At some point all SCI Greene death row inmates were moved to Phoenix. While there are no female capital case inmates, any female death row inmates would be housed at SCI Muncy. Prior to its closure, SCI Graterford housed male death row inmates.\nPennsylvania has only executed three inmates since 1976. The first was Keith Zettlemoyer in May 1995, followed by Leon Moser in August 1995. The third and most recent execution was carried out in July 1999, with the execution of Gary M. Heidnik. In all three cases, the individuals dropped their right to appeal. This makes Pennsylvania one of the least-active states to retain the death penalty. Pennsylvania is one of the states with the highest number of housed death row inmates.\nAs of August 2024, 96 people were on Pennsylvania's death row, all of whom are male. 74% of inmates in Pennsylvania who are on death row have been on it for more than 10 years. Some inmates who were facing death row have received re-trials or different sentencing str\nArnold Palmer Regional Airport (IATA: LBE, ICAO: KLBE, FAA LID: LBE) is in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States, two miles (3 km) southwest of Latrobe and about 33 miles (53 km) southeast of Pittsburgh. It was formerly Westmoreland County Airport; it was renamed in September 1999 for Arnold Palmer, who grew up nearby and learned to fly at the airport. Palmer learned to fly at the airport, and the dedication ceremony included Governor Tom Ridge and a flyover of three A-10s of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021 categorized it as a non-hub primary commercial service facility.\nPassenger traffic at the airport has significantly grown since Spirit Airlines began serving the airport in 2011, jumping from roughly 10,000 passengers in 2010 to 310,000 passengers in 2019, a 3000% increase. Spirit Airlines is the only commercial passenger carrier and currently flies two nonstop routes to one city in Florida and one city in South Carolina from the airport.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe airport was initially established as Longview Flying Field in 1924. It became J.D. Hill Airport in 1928, then Latrobe Airport in 1935.\nOn April 12, 1939, it became the site of the world’s first official airmail \"Air Pick Up\", where a Stinson Reliant aircraft successfully collected a mail container suspended between two poles without landing.\nIn 1978, the airport was renamed for the third time to Westmoreland County Airport after the county in which it resides. In 1999, to honor golf legend Arnold Palmer as part of his 70th birthday celebration, the airport took its current name. Palmer grew up within a mile of the runway where he was present for the 1939 airmail pickup as a child and where he subsequently learned to fly himself.\nThe airport was served by Northwest Airlink, as a reliever for Pittsburgh International Airport on the other side of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The airport had regional service by US Airways to Pittsburgh International Airport, until the company's bankruptcy. Northwest/Delta ended its service to Detroit on July 31, 2009.\nFederal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 18,946 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 15,482 in 2009 and 6,978 in 2010.\nIn February 2011 Spirit Airlines launched seasonal service to Fort Lauderdale and Myrtle Beach; in January 2012 Spirit announced they would start service to Orlando on May 17. The airline currently serves the airport year-round. Spirit now serves two cities from Arnold Palmer Regional Airport, and increased passenger traffic from 6,978 in 2010 to 355,910 in 2015. Southern Airways Express has expressed interest in a Latrobe-to-Pittsburgh route but no start date has been announced.\nIn January 2020, airport officials announced a $13 million project using federal grant money to widen the main runway to accommodate any size plane.\nOn September 3, 2020, President Donald Trump held a rally at the airport as part of his reelection campaign for the 2020 United States presidential election.\nOn October 19, 2024  President Donald Trump returned for a rally for the 2024 United States presidential election\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nThe airport covers 945 acres (382 ha) at an elevation of 1,199 feet (365 m). It has one active asphalt runway: 6/24 is 8,222 by 100 feet (2,506 x 30 m). Runway 3/21 is closed indefinitely; it was 3,609 by 75 feet (1,100 x 23 m). Runway 6/24 was formerly 5/23.\nIn the year ending December 31, 2021 the airport had 38,822 aircraft operations, average 106 per day: 80% general aviation, 13% air taxi, 5% airline, and 2% military. At that time, 138 aircraft were based at the airport: 91 single-engine, 11 multi-engine, 31 jet, and 5 helicopter.\nThe airport has a terminal building with one baggage claim. Long-term and overnight parking is free in lots B, C, D and E. Short-term parking is also available in lot A for a daily maximum of $10.

When the medal is awarded by the Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard for acts of valor or meritorious service in combat, the Combat \"V\" is authorized for wear on the medal.\nOfficers from the other Uniformed Services of the United States are eligible to receive this award, as are foreign soldiers who have served with or alongside a service branch of the United States Armed Forces.\nCivilians serving with U.S. military forces in combat are also eligible for the award. For example, UPI reporter Joe Galloway was awarded the Bronze Star with \"V\" device for actions during the Vietnam War, specifically rescuing a badly wounded soldier under fire in the Battle of Ia Drang Valley, in 1965. Another civilian recipient was writer Ernest Hemingway.\n\n\n== General information ==\nThe Bronze Star Medal was established by Executive Order 9419, 4 February 1944 (superseded by Executive Order 11046, 24 August 1962, as amended by Executive Order 13286, 28 February 2003).\nThe Bronze Star Medal may be awarded by the Secretary of a military department or the Secretary of Homeland Security with regard to the Coast Guard when not operating as a service in the Department of the Navy, or by such military commanders, or other appropriate officers as the Secretary concerned may designate, to any person who, while serving in any capacity in or with the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, or Space Force of the United States, after 6 December 1941, distinguishes, or has distinguished, herself or himself by heroic or meritorious achievement or service, not involving participation in aerial flight—\n\n(a) while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States;\n(b) while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force; or\n(c) while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party.\nThe acts of heroism are of a lesser degree than required for the award of the Silver Star. The acts of merit or acts of valor must be less than that required for the Legion of Merit but must nevertheless have been meritorious and accomplished with distinction.\nThe Bronze Star Medal (without the \"V\" device) may be awarded to each member of the Armed Forces of the United States who, after 6 December 1941, was cited in orders or awarded a certificate for exemplary conduct in ground combat against an armed enemy between 7 December 1941 and 2 September 1945. For this purpose, the US Army's Combat Infantryman Badge or Combat Medical Badge award is considered as a citation in orders. Documents executed since 4 August 1944 in connection with recommendations for the award of decorations of higher degree than the Bronze Star Medal cannot be used as the basis for an award under this paragraph.\nEffective 11 September 2001, the Meritorious Service Medal may also be bestowed in lieu of the Bronze Star Medal (without Combat \"V\" device) for meritorious achievement in a designated combat theater.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Bronze Star Medal was designed by Rudolf Freund (1878–1960) of the jewelry firm Bailey, Banks & Biddle. (Freund also designed the Silver Star.)\nThe medal is a bronze star 1+1⁄2 inches (38 mm) in circumscribing diameter. In the center is a 3⁄16 inch (4.8 mm) diameter superimposed bronze star, the center line of all rays of both stars coinciding. The reverse bears the inscription \"HEROIC OR MERITORIOUS ACHIEVEMENT\" with a space for the name of the recipient to be engraved. The star hangs from its ribbon by a rectangular metal loop with rounded corners.

Winters was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his successful command of the assault on Brécourt Manor during the invasion of Normandy. \nHis exploits were featured within numerous books and in the 2001 HBO mini-series Band of Brothers, in which he was portrayed by actor Damian Lewis.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\n\nWinters was born in New Holland, Pennsylvania,: 4  to Richard and Edith Winters on January 21, 1918. The family soon moved to nearby Ephrata, and then to Lancaster when he was eight years old.: 4  He graduated from Lancaster Boys High School in 1937 and attended Franklin and Marshall College.: 6 \nAt Franklin and Marshall, Winters was a member of the Upsilon chapter of Delta Sigma Phi fraternity and participated in intramural football and basketball. He had to give up wrestling, his favorite sport, and most of his social activities in favor of his studies and the part-time jobs that paid his way through college. He graduated in June 1941 with a bachelor's degree in economics, earning the highest academic standing in the business college.\n\n\n== Military service ==\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\n\n==== Training ====\n\nWinters wrote in his memoirs that he \"felt a strong sense of duty,\" but \"had no desire to get into the war\" and chose to immediately volunteer to be drafted after graduating college instead of having the uncertainty of being called up at an unknown future date \"interrupt a promising business career,\" and to fulfill the one-year requirement of service for draftees rather than the three-year term for Regular volunteers. He was officially inducted into the Army on August 25, 1941 at the New Cumberland Reception Center near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. In September, he underwent basic training at Camp Croft, South Carolina.: 7  While the rest of his fellow trainees were deployed to units stationed in the Panama Canal Zone in early December, Winters remained at Camp Croft to help train draftees and other volunteers. In April 1942, four months after the United States entered World War II, he was selected to attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) at Fort Benning, Georgia.: 8–9  There he became friends with Lewis Nixon, with whom he would serve throughout the war.: 13  He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the infantry after graduating from OCS on July 2, 1942.: 13 \nDuring his officer training, Winters decided to join the parachute infantry, part of the U.S. Army's new airborne forces.: 12  Upon completing training, he returned to Camp Croft to train another class of draftees as there were no positions available in the paratroopers at that time. After five weeks, he received orders to join the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment (506th PIR) at Camp Toccoa in Georgia.: 14  The 506th was commanded by Colonel Robert Sink.\nWinters arrived at Toccoa in mid-August 1942 and was assigned to Company E, 2nd Battalion, 506th PIR,: 16–17  which later became better known as \"Easy Company\" in accordance with the contemporaneous Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet. Serving under First Lieutenant Herbert Sobel, Winters was made platoon leader of 2nd Platoon, earning a promotion to first lieutenant in October 1942: 25 : 39  and made acting company executive officer, although this was not made official until May 1943.: 39  The 506th PIR was an experimental unit, the first regiment to undertake airborne training as a formed unit.: 18  The training at Toccoa was very tough. Of the 500 officers who had volunteered, only 148 completed the course; of 5,000 enlisted volunteers, only 1,800 were ultimately selected for duty as paratroopers.: 18 : 18 \nOn June 10, 1943, after more tactical training at Camp Mackall, North Carolina, the 506th PIR was attached to Major General William Lee's 101st \"Screaming Eagles\" Airbor",

Creation of DHS constitutes the most diverse merger ever of federal functions and responsibilities, incorporating 22 government agencies into a single organization. The founding of the DHS marked a change in American thought towards threats.\nIntroducing the term \"homeland\" centers attention on a population that needs to be protected not only against emergencies such as natural disasters but also against diffuse threats from individuals who are non-native to the United States."
